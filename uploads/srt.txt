1
00:00:13,496 --> 00:00:14,784
You should get one of these.

2
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:16,100
No, thank you.

3
00:00:16,746 --> 00:00:18,420
Do you even know what this is ?

4
00:00:18,749 --> 00:00:22,030
It is a fitness orb. And it has
completely changed my life

5
00:00:24,332 --> 00:00:27,498
Forget everything you thought
you knew about ab workouts.

6
00:00:28,006 --> 00:00:28,658
Done.

7
00:00:28,798 --> 00:00:31,514
This ab workout is specifically designed,

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,019
to strenghthen your core.

9
00:00:34,031 --> 00:00:35,297
- Sorry.
- That's alright.

10
00:00:36,476 --> 00:00:37,870
Numerous health benefits.

11
00:00:41,323 --> 00:00:42,156
Strengthens your back.

12
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:44,220
Better performance in sports.

13
00:00:45,586 --> 00:00:46,846
More enjoyable sex.

14
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:49,170
You are not having sex.

15
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,431
Plus, improves your reflexes.

16
00:00:55,617 --> 00:00:56,631
See, I would've caught that.

17
00:00:56,736 --> 00:00:57,371
Okay, you know what ?

18
00:00:57,946 --> 00:00:58,562
How much is that ?

19
00:00:59,366 --> 00:01:00,611
It's only 25 bucks.

20
00:01:03,027 --> 00:01:03,622
Okay.

21
00:01:40,647 --> 00:01:43,142

Transcript : Nikki(twiztv.com)

22
00:01:46,715 --> 00:01:48,600
Pam, could I see you in my office ?

23
00:01:50,267 --> 00:01:53,371
It's performance review day,
company wide.

24
00:01:53,456 --> 00:01:54,601
Last year,

25
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:59,393
my performance review started with Michael
asking me what my hopes and dreams were.

26
00:01:59,868 --> 00:02:04,463
And it ended with him telling me
he could bench press 190 pounds.

27
00:02:05,306 --> 00:02:07,381
So I don't really know what to expect.

28
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:10,433
- Pam, you're trustworthy. And a woman.
- Thank you.

29
00:02:10,546 --> 00:02:11,001
Oh no.

30
00:02:11,086 --> 00:02:14,371
And I want you to listen to
a voice mail from my boss.

31
00:02:16,058 --> 00:02:18,531
Micheal, it's Jan. I guess I missed you.

32
00:02:18,917 --> 00:02:21,900
I'll, be there this afternoon
for performance reviews.

33
00:02:22,647 --> 00:02:25,713
I hope it's understood, that will be
our only topic of discussion.

34
00:02:26,325 --> 00:02:27,353
See you soon.

35
00:02:27,505 --> 00:02:29,270
First impressions ?

36
00:02:31,145 --> 00:02:32,470
Just off the top,

37
00:02:33,118 --> 00:02:35,023
I think she'll be here this afternoon.

38
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,722
My boss is coming in today.

39
00:02:36,885 --> 00:02:38,503
The lovely Jan Levinson-Gould.

40
00:02:38,607 --> 00:02:41,233
Well, no Gould. The Gould has been.

41
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:42,683
Divorce

42
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:46,630
The awkward part is that
this is the first time,

43
00:02:46,816 --> 00:02:48,753
we'll be seeing each other since...

44
00:02:50,008 --> 00:02:50,860
Well...

45
00:02:52,026 --> 00:02:54,990
it was really nothing. We just sort
of got caught up in the moment.

46
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:57,890
The vulnerable devorcee,

47
00:02:58,248 --> 00:03:02,170
gives herself to the understanding
with rugged good looks office manager.

48
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:06,692
Just, uh, she didn't want it to
continue for some reason

49
00:03:08,215 --> 00:03:11,363
We both didn't, I didn't want, we
both didn't want it to continue.

50
00:03:11,996 --> 00:03:13,591
It was not professional.

51
00:03:15,346 --> 00:03:17,431
hen people say it, something's
mutual, it never is.

52
00:03:18,345 --> 00:03:19,613
But this was mutual.

53
00:03:21,355 --> 00:03:22,332
I guess I missed you.

54
00:03:22,906 --> 00:03:25,030
I guess I missed you.

55
00:03:25,967 --> 00:03:27,582
So she misses me.

56
00:03:27,896 --> 00:03:29,611
She missed you.

57
00:03:30,646 --> 00:03:33,021
But then she goes on to say,

58
00:03:33,177 --> 00:03:35,360
"That will be our only
topic of our discussion."

59
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:37,500
That doesn't mean anything.
Those are just words.

60
00:03:37,776 --> 00:03:39,321
I have one idea of what it means.

61
00:03:39,477 --> 00:03:40,601
Okay, yeah, what ? What ?

62
00:03:40,706 --> 00:03:42,760
Well, I don't think you're going
to be very happy with this.

63
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,142
Oh great.

64
00:03:45,645 --> 00:03:47,781
Alrigh, well, now I'm in a terrible mood.

65
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:51,290
Let's do your performance review.

66
00:03:51,355 --> 00:03:52,771
Because she's conflicted.

67
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,992
She has to be professional.

68
00:03:55,048 --> 00:03:57,541
But she's fighting feelings for you.

69
00:03:58,776 --> 00:04:00,662
Why, that's great news.

70
00:04:00,745 --> 00:04:01,823
That-that,

71
00:04:02,217 --> 00:04:04,033
then why would, why
would I not like that ?

72
00:04:04,737 --> 00:04:06,892
Just cause that you work together.

73
00:04:06,968 --> 00:04:09,251
- And it might be awkward.
- Wow, wow.

74
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,021
Alright,  let's listen to that again.

75
00:04:12,227 --> 00:04:14,901
<i>Michael, it's Jan. 
I guess I miss you.</i>

76
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:19,281
Listen, Jim.

77
00:04:19,997 --> 00:04:21,813
Here's a little tip for your
performance review.

78
00:04:22,335 --> 00:04:23,582
Tell Micheal,

79
00:04:23,687 --> 00:04:27,561
that we should be stocking more of
the double tabbed manilla file folders.

80
00:04:28,487 --> 00:04:29,633
We don't have double
tabbed manilla file folders.

81
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:30,612
- Oh yes we do.
- No we don't.

82
00:04:30,695 --> 00:04:31,672
Yeah, it's a new product.

83
00:04:31,715 --> 00:04:34,043
So you should just suggest that to him.

84
00:04:34,287 --> 00:04:35,853
And then he'll be sure
to give you a raise.

85
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:39,020
Well, I'm not asking for a raise.

86
00:04:39,127 --> 00:04:41,540
I'm gonna actually be
asking for a pay decrease.

87
00:04:42,276 --> 00:04:43,911
That is so stupid.

88
00:04:44,216 --> 00:04:45,951
What if he gives it to you ?

89
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,310
Then I win.

90
00:04:47,956 --> 00:04:50,673
You know what, I am going to zone
you out for the rest of today.

91
00:04:51,135 --> 00:04:52,970
I need to stay focused.

92
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:55,032
And I don't have to see you
tomorrow or Sunday.

93
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,612
please don't call me and we'll see
how things go on Monday.

94
00:05:00,235 --> 00:05:01,831
Stupid.

95
00:05:02,808 --> 00:05:03,983
Wait, wait, one thing.

96
00:05:05,157 --> 00:05:07,140
By tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right ?

97
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:12,921
Today is Thursday.
But Dwight thinks that it's Friday.

98
00:05:14,066 --> 00:05:16,862
And that's what I'll be 
working on this afternoon.

99
00:05:17,755 --> 00:05:21,242
Sometimes women say more in their
pauses than they say in thier words.

100
00:05:21,366 --> 00:05:23,013
- Really ?
- Oh yes.

101
00:05:23,216 --> 00:05:24,531
Let's listen to it again.

102
00:05:24,796 --> 00:05:27,563
And this time, really
listen to the pauses.

103
00:05:28,156 --> 00:05:30,533
Stanley, that's freakin' brilliant.
How do you know that ?

104
00:05:30,937 --> 00:05:32,790
Did you learn that on the streets ?

105
00:05:32,975 --> 00:05:34,663
- Sorry.
- Oh, it's okay.

106
00:05:34,838 --> 00:05:36,450
I did learn it on the streets.

107
00:05:36,807 --> 00:05:38,471
On the ghetto, in fact.

108
00:05:38,928 --> 00:05:40,342
No kidding.

109
00:05:41,235 --> 00:05:42,611
It's all about my bonus.

110
00:05:45,128 --> 00:05:47,133
-  Michael and Jan definitely made out.
- Oh !

111
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:49,071
Maybe more.

112
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:52,713
Also it is Thursday, but
Dwight thinks it's Friday.

113
00:05:52,816 --> 00:05:55,142
- So, keep that going.
- Yay !

114
00:05:59,486 --> 00:06:02,150
Good work Stanley.
Great performance review.

115
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:04,030
For Stanley in the house everybody.

116
00:06:05,508 --> 00:06:06,950
Angela, it's your turn.

117
00:06:07,188 --> 00:06:09,193
Actually look forward to
performance review.

118
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:12,010
I did the youth beauty pageant circuit.

119
00:06:12,378 --> 00:06:14,180
And I enjoyed that quite a bit.

120
00:06:14,646 --> 00:06:16,633
I really enjoy being judged.

121
00:06:17,568 --> 00:06:21,521
I believe I hold up very well
to even severe scrutiny.

122
00:06:21,846 --> 00:06:22,501
Michael.

123
00:06:22,617 --> 00:06:24,130
- Yeah.
- Jan's on the phone for you.

124
00:06:25,657 --> 00:06:27,962
Angela, you were totally
satisfactory this year.

125
00:06:29,835 --> 00:06:30,980
Interesting,

126
00:06:31,137 --> 00:06:33,832
Jan is calling me. 
Maybe it wasn't so mutual after all.

127
00:06:34,658 --> 00:06:35,831
Yeah.

128
00:06:35,986 --> 00:06:37,013
<i>- Michael.</i>
- Jan !

129
00:06:37,338 --> 00:06:39,382
To what do I owe this pleasure ?

130
00:06:39,845 --> 00:06:41,610
<i>I am returning your many calls.</i>

131
00:06:41,726 --> 00:06:43,553
Well, hello to you too.

132
00:06:44,665 --> 00:06:46,061
I was just...

133
00:06:46,718 --> 00:06:50,140
I just wanted to get some closure
on what transpired between us,

134
00:06:51,206 --> 00:06:53,801
At the meeting we had I
in the parking lot of the Chili's.

135
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:57,680
<i>No.</i>

136
00:06:58,315 --> 00:07:00,412
<i>No.  We-we won't be
discussing that, Michael.</i>

137
00:07:00,536 --> 00:07:03,153
<i>The only things I want to talk about
during your performance review,</i>

138
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:06,163
<i>are your concrete ideas
to improve your branch.</i>

139
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:08,882
Well, surely this,

140
00:07:09,436 --> 00:07:12,191
because of what ...

141
00:07:13,027 --> 00:07:15,630
happened, uh, at our meeting
in the parking lot of the Chili's.

142
00:07:15,658 --> 00:07:18,080
<i>Review is anything but
a formality, Michael.</i>

143
00:07:18,865 --> 00:07:22,250
And, uh, I expec you to forget
anything that you think may,

144
00:07:22,563 --> 00:07:26,296
have happened between us and exhibit
completely professional behavior.

145
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:28,310
I'm thinking about you.

146
00:07:28,486 --> 00:07:31,726
That is an example of completely
unprofessional behavior.

147
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:34,482
I don't see how that's unprofessional.

148
00:07:34,635 --> 00:07:35,831
<i>- Michael.
- Yeah.</i>

149
00:07:35,985 --> 00:07:37,320
<i>- Are the cameras
in there with you ? </i>

150
00:07:37,395 --> 00:07:38,293
<i>- In your office ?
- No</i>

151
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:39,812
They are not.

152
00:07:42,246 --> 00:07:43,262
Yes they are.

153
00:07:46,676 --> 00:07:48,290
That's my girlfriend.

154
00:07:49,148 --> 00:07:51,703
I heard they made out and had sex.

155
00:07:51,878 --> 00:07:53,611
I heard they just made out. That's it.

156
00:07:55,948 --> 00:07:58,233
Well, I heard they made out...

157
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,850
- And had sex.
- Don't talk about it.

158
00:08:03,307 --> 00:08:06,321
Office romances are nobody's
business but the people involved.

159
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:11,473
Romances ?

160
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:15,421
Pam, I have ideas on
a daily basis, I know I do.

161
00:08:15,967 --> 00:08:19,251
I have a clear memory of
telling people my ideas.

162
00:08:20,556 --> 00:08:22,762
is there any chance that you
wrote any of my ideas down ?

163
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:25,372
in a folder, like an idea folder ?

164
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:26,140
Sorry.

165
00:08:30,045 --> 00:08:31,390
How about the suggestion box ?

166
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:32,760
There's tons of ideas in there.

167
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:35,793
- What suggestion box ?
- The suggestion box that I put out.

168
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:38,501
And people could put in
suggestions anonymously.

169
00:08:38,737 --> 00:08:40,912
- Maybe there's prizes ?
- Oh yeah.

170
00:08:41,296 --> 00:08:43,813
Oh yeah. I think I remember that
from back when I first started.

171
00:08:43,965 --> 00:08:46,171
Why don't you find it and
then tell people to get theirs-

172
00:08:47,095 --> 00:08:47,923
Never mind, I'll tell them.

173
00:08:48,037 --> 00:08:49,210
Hello, everybody.

174
00:08:49,338 --> 00:08:51,171
Yeah, ah, attention, please.

175
00:08:51,205 --> 00:08:53,263
Jan Levinson's coming very soon.

176
00:08:53,516 --> 00:08:56,683
And so we're going to have our
weekly suggestion box meeting.

177
00:08:57,347 --> 00:09:00,871
So you can all get in your
constructive compliments ASAP.

178
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,192
Don't you mean constructive criticism ?

179
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:05,680
- What did I say ?
- You said constructive compliments.

180
00:09:05,735 --> 00:09:06,611
That doesn't make any sense.

181
00:09:06,766 --> 00:09:09,173
Well, Kelly. That was neither
constructive nor a compliment.

182
00:09:09,247 --> 00:09:11,893
o maybe you should stop
criticizing my English.

183
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:14,383
And start making some suggestions.

184
00:09:14,736 --> 00:09:15,540
Okay ?

185
00:09:15,868 --> 00:09:18,681
Dan, this is Jim, it is about 11:15.

186
00:09:18,886 --> 00:09:21,001
and I wanted to know what
you were up to tomorrow,

187
00:09:21,105 --> 00:09:24,630
which is the 15th and that is a...

188
00:09:24,788 --> 00:09:25,620
Saturday.

189
00:09:25,727 --> 00:09:29,701
Saturday, so just let me know what you're
doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch.

190
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:31,703
Okay, talk to you soon.

191
00:09:38,988 --> 00:09:40,652
- Okay, bye-bye.

192
00:09:40,858 --> 00:09:42,373
Would you please tell
Michael that I'm here.

193
00:09:42,476 --> 00:09:43,301
Sure.

194
00:09:43,487 --> 00:09:44,652
Hi, Jan.

195
00:09:44,735 --> 00:09:46,081
- How are you ?
- Hi Micheal, I'm good. How are you ?

196
00:09:46,158 --> 00:09:47,701
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

197
00:09:47,786 --> 00:09:48,612
Okay.

198
00:09:49,447 --> 00:09:51,191
Okay, why don't we
just step into my off ?

199
00:09:52,797 --> 00:09:54,681
- We're to go in here.
- Can we please go into your office ?

200
00:09:55,168 --> 00:09:57,171
Yep, right after you.

201
00:09:57,418 --> 00:09:59,252
Apres vous.

202
00:10:07,795 --> 00:10:08,430
I got...

203
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:10,910
- Thank you.
- It's nice to see you.

204
00:10:11,335 --> 00:10:13,131
- Nice to see you too Michael.
- Really ?

205
00:10:13,928 --> 00:10:15,000
Not like that.

206
00:10:17,196 --> 00:10:19,893
You know, Michael, I think I need to
make something clear right off the top.

207
00:10:20,046 --> 00:10:24,060
I'm not going to discuss anything with
you other than Dunder Mifflin business.

208
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:24,963
- Alright.
- Period.

209
00:10:25,037 --> 00:10:25,651
Yep.

210
00:10:25,755 --> 00:10:27,982
- Do we understand each other ?
- Absolutely.

211
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,781
I'm a little confused because
first it's all like kissey, kissey.

212
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,692
And then it's like all regret.
Because, oh, I regret that.

213
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:36,343
But wait, I'm still going to call you.

214
00:10:36,788 --> 00:10:38,893
But-but we're just going
to talk business.

215
00:10:39,546 --> 00:10:42,440
And I may come down there and
fire you if you don't do your job.

216
00:10:42,716 --> 00:10:45,412
But what were we talking
about when we first kissed ?

217
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:46,700
Business.

218
00:10:46,885 --> 00:10:49,420
So are you still in the middle of
performance reviews then ?

219
00:10:49,487 --> 00:10:49,803
No, no, no.

220
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,893
I finished all of that. I'm very fast.
I'm not too fast.

221
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:55,450
Not like wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.

222
00:10:56,178 --> 00:10:58,081
But I do say thank you, ma'am.

223
00:10:58,306 --> 00:11:00,410
But I'm not like, wham, bam.

224
00:11:00,716 --> 00:11:02,873
Not that there's anything
wrong with wham, bam.

225
00:11:02,988 --> 00:11:04,922
If it's consensual.

226
00:11:05,978 --> 00:11:08,871
We're talking about office stuff.

227
00:11:10,648 --> 00:11:12,313
- Can I ask you a question ?
-  No.

228
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,432
This is a business question.

229
00:11:14,566 --> 00:11:16,162
It is nothing personal, I promise.

230
00:11:16,606 --> 00:11:17,731
Fine.

231
00:11:18,405 --> 00:11:20,510
Are you wearing a new perfume today ?

232
00:11:22,456 --> 00:11:23,532
How is that a business question ?

233
00:11:23,685 --> 00:11:25,380
Well, you're wearing it at the office.

234
00:11:25,465 --> 00:11:26,713
A nd...

235
00:11:26,818 --> 00:11:27,370
it,

236
00:11:27,497 --> 00:11:30,291
I'm sorry, no offense,
but it's really sexy.

237
00:11:30,626 --> 00:11:32,293
Please don't smell me Michael.

238
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,330
- Hey Jim.
- Hey, how's it going ?

239
00:11:38,537 --> 00:11:40,320
Oh, my God, did you see
The Apprentice last night ?

240
00:11:40,388 --> 00:11:42,140
Of course, it's on every Thursday night.

241
00:11:42,228 --> 00:11:43,270
So how can I miss it ?

242
00:11:43,527 --> 00:11:44,643
Can you believe who Trump fired ?

243
00:11:44,698 --> 00:11:46,213
- No, that was unbelievable.
- Who ?

244
00:11:46,368 --> 00:11:48,402
- Who was it? Who did he fire ?
- You didn't see it?

245
00:11:49,436 --> 00:11:51,910
No. I went out and got drunk with
my laser tag team last night.

246
00:11:52,016 --> 00:11:52,990
Crap!

247
00:11:53,198 --> 00:11:54,883
I never go out on a Thursday night.

248
00:11:55,045 --> 00:11:57,302
What the hell was I thinking ?

249
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,980
I don't understand...

250
00:12:00,255 --> 00:12:01,921
Hold on, sorry.

251
00:12:02,145 --> 00:12:03,270
Yes, Pam.

252
00:12:03,428 --> 00:12:05,883
Michael, it's time for the
suggestion box meeting.

253
00:12:05,917 --> 00:12:08,392
I'm kind of in the middle of something.
I wish you wouldn't interrupt.

254
00:12:08,447 --> 00:12:12,153
You told me to buzz you about the
suggestion box meeting when Jan was here.

255
00:12:12,228 --> 00:12:14,613
I did not, not use those words.

256
00:12:14,628 --> 00:12:17,271
I'd like to sit in on that meeting.
Is it happening right now ?

257
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:18,443
No, it's in like, 10 minutes.


258
00:12:18,566 --> 00:12:20,441
Everyone's waiting in 
the conference room.

259
00:12:20,626 --> 00:12:22,312
Great, very good.

260
00:12:27,857 --> 00:12:29,302
Why are we here ?

261
00:12:29,357 --> 00:12:31,482
Because I value your opinions.

262
00:12:31,645 --> 00:12:34,710
Now I know a lot of you don't think
that I read your suggestions.

263
00:12:34,765 --> 00:12:35,301
But I do.

264
00:12:35,357 --> 00:12:37,683
I just sift through them every week.

265
00:12:37,887 --> 00:12:40,612
And I really look and scrutinize,

266
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:42,381
to see what you guys are writing.

267
00:12:42,825 --> 00:12:46,443
So let's just, uh, read some
of these suckers, okay ?

268
00:12:46,595 --> 00:12:48,412
Alright. Number one.

269
00:12:48,548 --> 00:12:50,581
"What should we do to prepare for Y2K ?"

270
00:12:50,655 --> 00:12:52,710
"What should we do to prepare for Y2K ?"

271
00:12:52,866 --> 00:12:54,110
I thought you read these every week ?

272
00:12:54,195 --> 00:12:56,570
Well, obviously, this one
got stuck in the box.

273
00:12:57,525 --> 00:12:59,430
- That happens occasionally.
- It happens occasionally.

274
00:12:59,535 --> 00:13:01,003
And, so...

275
00:13:01,665 --> 00:13:03,800
One down. Next suggestion.

276
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:08,960
"We need a better outreach for
employees fighting depression."

277
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,450
Okay, alright, enought with the jokes.

278
00:13:11,877 --> 00:13:13,971
Nobody in here is suffering
from depression.

279
00:13:14,047 --> 00:13:15,763
That sounds serious Michael.

280
00:13:16,236 --> 00:13:18,120
Well, yeah. Who wrote it ?

281
00:13:18,268 --> 00:13:19,881
- Tom ? 
- Tom. Then it is a joke.

282
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:21,872
Because there is nobody
in here named Tom.

283
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:24,801
Tom ? He worked in accounting
up until about a year ago.

284
00:13:27,346 --> 00:13:28,282
Tom.

285
00:13:31,156 --> 00:13:32,701
Oh, that guy. That guy was weird.

286
00:13:33,735 --> 00:13:35,643
- Alright, next suggestion.
- Next suggestion.

287
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:37,590
Argh, badoo badoo.

288
00:13:38,705 --> 00:13:40,490
"You need to do something
about your B.O."

289
00:13:40,527 --> 00:13:42,690
You need to do something about your B.O.

290
00:13:43,087 --> 00:13:46,391
Now,  I don't know who
this suggestion is meant for.

291
00:13:46,476 --> 00:13:48,552
But it's more of a personal suggestion,

292
00:13:48,905 --> 00:13:50,723
And it's not an office suggestion.

293
00:13:50,827 --> 00:13:53,201
And far be it from me to use this
as a platform to embarass anybody.

294
00:13:53,307 --> 00:13:56,603
Aren't the suggestions meant for you ?

295
00:13:57,316 --> 00:13:58,423
Well, Toby.

296
00:13:58,617 --> 00:14:03,230
If by me you are inferring
that I have B.O.,

297
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:06,901
hen I would say that that is
a very poor choice of words.

298
00:14:07,716 --> 00:14:10,932
Micheal, he wasn't inferring, he
was implying. You were inferring.

299
00:14:11,046 --> 00:14:12,411
Was I, Creed ?

300
00:14:12,565 --> 00:14:15,631
Okay, well, you know what I am implying,

301
00:14:16,075 --> 00:14:18,281
is that when we're on
an elevator together,

302
00:14:18,306 --> 00:14:20,261
I should maybe take the stairs,

303
00:14:20,536 --> 00:14:22,370
because talk about stank.

304
00:14:22,745 --> 00:14:24,882
Not that I would ever say
something like that in public,

305
00:14:24,885 --> 00:14:26,601
and I never have, and I never will,

306
00:14:26,807 --> 00:14:29,183
just think it's something that we
should all be aware of.

307
00:14:29,797 --> 00:14:30,702
okay ?

308
00:14:31,295 --> 00:14:33,871
Now that we've learned this,
let's continue.

309
00:14:34,286 --> 00:14:37,790
See, this is good. We're learning,
and we're figuring some stuff out.

310
00:14:38,538 --> 00:14:40,200
"You need to do something
about your coffee breath."

311
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:42,240
- You need to do something about
- Shut up, shut up, shut up,

312
00:14:42,368 --> 00:14:44,470
Okay, I don't think you
people are grasping,

313
00:14:44,876 --> 00:14:47,720
the concept of the suggestion box.

314
00:14:47,936 --> 00:14:50,552
Sometimes you talk to us real close.

315
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,842
Yeah? Is that hard for you ?

316
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:53,700
Alright, well...

317
00:14:53,857 --> 00:14:55,681
- Well, when you have coffee breath, it's hard
- I'll work on that, okay.

318
00:14:55,826 --> 00:14:57,613
Okay. Let's keep, let's keep going.

319
00:15:00,158 --> 00:15:02,283
What do we have here ? We have..

320
00:15:03,147 --> 00:15:05,033
Somebody's piece of gum.

321
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:06,211
Somebody put a piece
of gum in there.

322
00:15:06,267 --> 00:15:08,873
This is not a-a garbage can.

323
00:15:08,926 --> 00:15:10,250
This is the future of our company.

324
00:15:10,338 --> 00:15:12,681
This is not a place for gum, okay ?

325
00:15:13,088 --> 00:15:15,121
I don't want to have to
read these tomorrow...

326
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:17,262
Yeah, who wants to
come in on a Saturday ?

327
00:15:17,705 --> 00:15:19,030
Yeah. What ?

328
00:15:19,425 --> 00:15:22,222
- Alright. Next suggestion.
-  Next suggestion.

329
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:26,310
"Don't sl-" Okay, that's blank.

330
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,352
"Don't sleep with your boss ?"

331
00:15:31,116 --> 00:15:33,161
Do you think this is referring
to you boning Jan ?

332
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,641
- I can't, I can't. Alright, please sit down
- I don't understand why you're so upset.

333
00:15:37,665 --> 00:15:39,491
I'm going to sit over here,
you're going to sit over there.

334
00:15:39,535 --> 00:15:40,251
Let me ask you this.

335
00:15:40,298 --> 00:15:41,222
Please sit yourself down.

336
00:15:41,355 --> 00:15:43,560
- Let me ask you something.
- What, Michael ?

337
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,882
Where did you get your outfit ?

338
00:15:48,496 --> 00:15:50,501
You’re going to give me this raise.

339
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,673
I deserve this raise.

340
00:15:53,188 --> 00:15:54,970
Yes ! Yes ! Yes !

341
00:15:58,735 --> 00:16:00,961
The least you can do is keep my
salary consistent with inflation !

342
00:16:03,276 --> 00:16:05,821
Yes! Why are you going to
give me this raise ?!

343
00:16:06,217 --> 00:16:07,682
Why ?!

344
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:11,570
Because, I’m awesome !

345
00:16:11,657 --> 00:16:13,973
I am awesome !

346
00:16:14,398 --> 00:16:16,600
I just don't understand,

347
00:16:16,645 --> 00:16:18,682
why you have to pretend
like nothing happened.

348
00:16:18,917 --> 00:16:20,671
Because nothing did Michael.

349
00:16:21,716 --> 00:16:24,020
It, I'm not going to say
anything more about it.

350
00:16:24,035 --> 00:16:25,600
And I would advise that you do the same.

351
00:16:26,117 --> 00:16:27,461
Look.
Michael ?

352
00:16:27,605 --> 00:16:29,221
- Oh my God.
- I'm sorry, am I interrupting.

353
00:16:29,496 --> 00:16:31,073
Oh God. Were you guys making out ?

354
00:16:31,245 --> 00:16:32,662
No, Dwight. Come in.

355
00:16:32,888 --> 00:16:34,331
- Great.
- What do you want, Dwight ?

356
00:16:34,395 --> 00:16:36,760
I am ready for my performance review.

357
00:16:36,968 --> 00:16:40,041
Okay. Great. Your performance
has been adaquate.

358
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:42,152
You may leave. Good-bye. 

359
00:16:42,745 --> 00:16:45,551
Is this how you've been conducting
all the reviews, Michael ?

360
00:16:46,087 --> 00:16:48,062
You want to talk now ? Good.
Okay, Dwight, leave.

361
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,550
Oh, wait. I would like
to discuss my raise.

362
00:16:50,646 --> 00:16:53,010
Why on earth would we give you a raise ?

363
00:16:53,237 --> 00:16:54,703
That is an excellent question.

364
00:16:54,898 --> 00:16:56,432
Thank you for asking.

365
00:16:58,786 --> 00:17:01,570
Let me bring up one word.
Dedication.

366
00:17:02,846 --> 00:17:05,380
I  have never, been late.

367
00:17:05,837 --> 00:17:06,692
Also,

368
00:17:07,036 --> 00:17:09,823
I have never missed a day due to illness.

369
00:17:09,855 --> 00:17:12,103
Even when I had walking pneumonia.

370
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,751
I even come in on holidays.

371
00:17:15,108 --> 00:17:17,000
You do ? How do you get in ?

372
00:17:17,378 --> 00:17:18,742
I have a copy of your key.

373
00:17:18,917 --> 00:17:21,360
- That's a serious offense.
- That is a serious offense.

374
00:17:21,435 --> 00:17:23,021
Very serious.

375
00:17:23,216 --> 00:17:24,953
As is toying with a man's heart.

376
00:17:25,035 --> 00:17:26,823
Oh, Michael, for God sakes.

377
00:17:26,975 --> 00:17:29,782
I'd also further like to talk
about my merits in the workplace.

378
00:17:29,956 --> 00:17:31,603
Okay, third wheel,
why don't you do that ?

379
00:17:31,638 --> 00:17:34,890
For instance, the time brought in
deer jerky for the whole office.

380
00:17:35,017 --> 00:17:36,803
That was deer ? Gross.

381
00:17:36,876 --> 00:17:38,692
- Oh, god, Did not
- You liked it.

382
00:17:38,787 --> 00:17:40,202
- Jan, have you ever had deer?
- No

383
00:17:40,358 --> 00:17:42,851
It's a delicacy. And, you know
what, it's an aphrodisiac.

384
00:17:43,337 --> 00:17:46,223
So when we're done here, you guys
could go over to the Antler Lodge,

385
00:17:46,308 --> 00:17:47,701
sample some deer, and
talk about my raise.

386
00:17:48,037 --> 00:17:49,152
What do you say Jan?

387
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:51,900
Okay. Here's what I'm going to do.
I'm going to step outside,

388
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:54,412
collect my thoughts, and I will
return in about 10 minutes.

389
00:17:54,557 --> 00:17:56,463
- Okay, you just, clear your head.
- Thank you Dwight.

390
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,152
I know it's your job.
I know you have to ask.

391
00:18:01,306 --> 00:18:03,753
but I promise you, I'm not going
to discuss it with him.

392
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:05,710
I'm certainly not going
to discuss it with you.

393
00:18:06,305 --> 00:18:07,722
Do you have a light?

394
00:18:08,186 --> 00:18:11,781
And in conclusion, I think Lex Luther
said it best, when he said,

395
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:17,153
"Dad, you have no idea,
what, I'm capable of."

396
00:18:17,247 --> 00:18:19,133
- That's from Superman ?
- Smallville.

397
00:18:19,236 --> 00:18:24,273
And that, is why I feel,
I deserve this raise.

398
00:18:28,078 --> 00:18:30,420
Do you think Michael and Jan actually...

399
00:18:31,086 --> 00:18:33,533
I don't really want to picture it,
but thank you, Pam.

400
00:18:34,296 --> 00:18:36,050
How do you come back from that ?

401
00:18:37,356 --> 00:18:38,523
You don't

402
00:18:38,796 --> 00:18:40,702
I don't think, come all the
way back, you know?

403
00:18:40,955 --> 00:18:42,252
Especially working together.

404
00:18:42,535 --> 00:18:44,442
No, I mean, doing that with Michael.

405
00:18:44,577 --> 00:18:47,320
How do you come back from that,
as a human being ?

406
00:18:47,448 --> 00:18:49,593
Oh, yeah. No. I don't think you can.

407
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:52,231
I'm heading back to New York.

408
00:18:52,378 --> 00:18:56,113
Allan and I will conduct your performance
review over the phone tomorrow.

409
00:18:56,186 --> 00:18:57,641
- Okay, good ?
- Wait, wait, wait... No, no, no.

410
00:18:57,748 --> 00:18:59,823
Come, I just, I just want to know why.

411
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:03,080
Michael, now is not the
time or the place.

412
00:19:03,307 --> 00:19:04,792
Okay. So you're saying that there is,

413
00:19:04,838 --> 00:19:05,760
- a different or place...
- No.

414
00:19:05,818 --> 00:19:06,692
- that we can have this discssion.
- I am saying...

415
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,602
We are never gonna
have this conversation.

416
00:19:08,686 --> 00:19:11,382
Well, okay. Never as in
never, ever, ever ?

417
00:19:11,606 --> 00:19:13,922
<i>Or never as in there's no chance?</i>

418
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:15,861
<i>Never for me always
means never, ever, ever.</i>

419
00:19:16,258 --> 00:19:19,011
From the horse's mouth,

420
00:19:19,267 --> 00:19:21,103
- what is the deal-io ?
- You know Michael.

421
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:21,891
- Am I too short ?
- Michael !

422
00:19:21,906 --> 00:19:23,361
It has nothing to do
with your looks, okay ?

423
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:24,590
It's your, it's your personality.

424
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:27,282
I mean you're obnoxious, and rude.

425
00:19:27,448 --> 00:19:30,750
And-and-and stupid.

426
00:19:30,817 --> 00:19:32,673
And you do have coffee
breath by the way.

427
00:19:34,196 --> 00:19:35,510
And-and, I don't agree about the B.O.

428
00:19:35,616 --> 00:19:38,522
But you are very, very, inconsiderate.

429
00:19:38,966 --> 00:19:41,073
- Really ?
- Really. You're-you're-you're...

430
00:19:41,837 --> 00:19:45,091
- You're a great guy, okay ?
- I appreciate that, thank you.

431
00:19:45,308 --> 00:19:46,670
You were very sweet.

432
00:19:46,805 --> 00:19:49,232
And you stayed up with
me and talked to me,

433
00:19:49,997 --> 00:19:51,753
and cried with me and I appreciate that.

434
00:19:51,827 --> 00:19:53,612
No, i wasn't, I wasn't crying.

435
00:19:53,705 --> 00:19:57,052
But I am just not in the place right now
where I'm looking for a relationship.

436
00:19:57,178 --> 00:19:59,232
So, we can still work together,

437
00:19:59,337 --> 00:20:01,412
We can still be friends, but...

438
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:04,620
Okay ?

439
00:20:06,168 --> 00:20:08,760
So my looks have nothing to do with it.

440
00:20:14,675 --> 00:20:18,611
Jan is not in a place where she feels,
she can have a relationship right now.

441
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:21,583
And it doesn't matter
how great a guy I am.

442
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:25,041
And that is all I needed. I'm good.

443
00:20:25,846 --> 00:20:27,323
I can go home now.

444
00:20:37,747 --> 00:20:38,451
Hey !

445
00:20:38,846 --> 00:20:40,903
It's 12:20. Where the hell is Dwight?

446
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:43,181
No idea.

447
00:20:43,358 --> 00:20:45,013
Never missed a day my ass.

448
00:20:55,316 --> 00:20:57,823
I'm here ! I'm here!

449
00:21:00,117 --> 00:21:01,702
I'm here ! It's okay !

<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

1
00:00:00,223 --> 00:00:01,663
Nothing much what's up with you ?

2
00:00:02,311 --> 00:00:03,824
I cannot believe I feel for that.

3
00:00:05,161 --> 00:00:06,123
Gosh.

4
00:00:06,815 --> 00:00:08,997
What ? What ?
Where's the funny ?

5
00:00:10,321 --> 00:00:10,956
Give it to me.

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,707
Is it me or does it smell
like updog in here ?

7
00:00:16,352 --> 00:00:17,029
What's updog ?

8
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:18,763
Nothing much, what's up with you ?

9
00:00:22,688 --> 00:00:24,201
I walked right into that.

10
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:26,620
Oh, that's brilliant.

11
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,614
Hey Stanley.
Is that jacket made of updog ?

12
00:00:29,711 --> 00:00:30,891
I'm on the phone.

13
00:00:35,978 --> 00:00:37,787
What flavor coffee is that, updog ?

14
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:39,852
- What's that ?
- I don't know. Nothing.

15
00:00:39,886 --> 00:00:41,051
What's up with you ?

16
00:00:42,316 --> 00:00:43,312
- Huh ?
- No.

17
00:00:43,345 --> 00:00:44,413
Damn it.

18
00:00:44,687 --> 00:00:45,713
What does that mean ?

19
00:00:46,228 --> 00:00:47,150
What does what mean ?

20
00:00:47,197 --> 00:00:49,242
- That thing you just said.
- Just forget it.

21
00:00:50,188 --> 00:00:51,192
Dwight.

22
00:00:51,967 --> 00:00:55,242
Hey, is it me or does this place
smell like updog ?

23
00:00:55,308 --> 00:00:56,943
- What's updog ?
- Gotcha !

24
00:00:57,627 --> 00:00:58,793
Oh God !

25
00:00:59,895 --> 00:01:00,900
Crap.

26
00:01:03,417 --> 00:01:04,662
Nothing.

27
00:01:04,966 --> 00:01:06,512
- How are you doing ?
- Good.

28
00:01:07,617 --> 00:01:08,932
How are you doing ?

29
00:01:12,725 --> 00:01:13,782
"So close."

33
00:01:51,597 --> 00:01:54,031
Today is spring cleaning day
here at Dunder Mifflin.

34
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:56,891
And yes, I know it's January. 
I am not an idiot.

35
00:01:57,015 --> 00:01:59,631
But if you do your spring cleaning
in January,

36
00:01:59,716 --> 00:02:01,743
guess what you don't have to do
in the spring ?

37
00:02:02,558 --> 00:02:03,600
Anything.

38
00:02:04,278 --> 00:02:06,582
They say a cluttered desk means
a cluttered mind.

39
00:02:06,638 --> 00:02:09,402
Well, I say an empty desk
means an...

40
00:02:09,687 --> 00:02:11,351
- Empty mind.
- No, that's not...

41
00:02:11,406 --> 00:02:13,290
No. That's not what I was going
to say.

42
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,500
Meredith. Men's room.

43
00:02:15,605 --> 00:02:17,700
Make sure you replace
the urinal cakes.

44
00:02:17,788 --> 00:02:18,980
They're worn down.

45
00:02:19,026 --> 00:02:21,292
Kevin, file drawers.

46
00:02:22,528 --> 00:02:23,773
Angela, kitchen.

47
00:02:24,217 --> 00:02:26,170
Oscar, dusting.
Where's Oscar ?

48
00:02:26,758 --> 00:02:27,710
He's out sick.

49
00:02:28,935 --> 00:02:30,152
That is unacceptable.

50
00:02:30,248 --> 00:02:31,912
I agree. It's unacceptable.

51
00:02:37,827 --> 00:02:39,253
What are you guys doing ?

52
00:02:41,466 --> 00:02:42,830
- Michael. 
- Yes.

53
00:02:46,025 --> 00:02:47,651
Oscar is out sick.

54
00:02:49,155 --> 00:02:50,263
On a Friday ?

55
00:02:56,366 --> 00:02:58,691
-Can I do some of the talking ?
- I will do the talking.

56
00:02:58,716 --> 00:03:00,440
'Kay, let him know
that I'm here, though.

57
00:03:00,465 --> 00:03:02,461
What difference does it make
that you're here ?

58
00:03:02,496 --> 00:03:04,173
Hi, Oscar, it's Michael.

59
00:03:04,605 --> 00:03:05,951
And Dwight.

60
00:03:06,757 --> 00:03:08,102
Heard you were under the weather.

61
00:03:08,157 --> 00:03:10,030
<i>Yeah, I think I came down
with the flu.</i>

62
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,560
Really. Oh, that is a shame.

63
00:03:12,668 --> 00:03:14,852
You know, it's cleaning day
here today.

64
00:03:14,907 --> 00:03:17,513
Could've used some of that famous
Hispanic cleaning ethic.

65
00:03:17,577 --> 00:03:18,973
<i>Yeah, I feel terrible about it.</i>

66
00:03:19,015 --> 00:03:21,140
Ask for his symptoms, I'm on WebMD.

67
00:03:21,175 --> 00:03:22,451
What are your symptoms ?

68
00:03:23,358 --> 00:03:26,653
<i>I have the chills, I'm feeling
nauseous,  and my head's killing.</i>

69
00:03:30,357 --> 00:03:31,362
Checks out.

70
00:03:31,387 --> 00:03:34,222
<i>Is there anything you need from me ?
I would like to go back to bed.</i>

71
00:03:34,236 --> 00:03:36,383
I need you to go to bed.
I need you to get better.

72
00:03:36,457 --> 00:03:38,452
See you Monday,
unless you're still sick.

73
00:03:38,577 --> 00:03:41,263
- So, have a great long weekend.
- <i>I'll just be sleep...</i>

74
00:03:42,898 --> 00:03:44,541
Okay, first impressions.

75
00:03:44,955 --> 00:03:45,960
He sounded sick.

76
00:03:45,986 --> 00:03:47,710
Which  is exactly how
you'd want to sound,

77
00:03:47,737 --> 00:03:49,623
if you wanted someone
to think you were sick.

78
00:03:49,645 --> 00:03:52,543
- That's exactly what I was thinking.
- Question, may I investigate ?

79
00:03:52,578 --> 00:03:54,171
Yeah, drop what you're doing.

80
00:03:54,306 --> 00:03:55,712
Make this a priority.

81
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:59,010
Because an office can't
function efficiently

82
00:03:59,035 --> 00:04:01,820
unless people are at their desks
doing their jobs.

83
00:04:02,557 --> 00:04:05,673
- I bought my veil.
- Oh my God, that is so exciting.

84
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,532
Can I be a bridesmaid ?

85
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:10,703
Listen, you don't have
to answer now,

86
00:04:10,725 --> 00:04:12,370
but how are you going
to do your hair ?

87
00:04:12,406 --> 00:04:15,192
Okay, I was thinking about
wearing it down.

88
00:04:15,228 --> 00:04:17,593
Kind of like, I don't know, like...

89
00:04:17,885 --> 00:04:19,071
loose with big curls.

90
00:04:19,105 --> 00:04:21,763
You look like an angel,
I'm seriously going to cry.

91
00:04:21,816 --> 00:04:23,640
Wowee,

92
00:04:23,815 --> 00:04:25,093
Mikey likey.

93
00:04:25,158 --> 00:04:27,571
Why don't you wear your hair
down like that all the time ?

94
00:04:27,598 --> 00:04:28,731
It's much sexier.

95
00:04:31,288 --> 00:04:33,193
Man, this must be torture for you.

96
00:04:35,385 --> 00:04:37,720
Yeah, on the booze cruise, I...

97
00:04:37,925 --> 00:04:40,532
told Michael about some feelings
I used to have for Pam.

98
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:44,093
I had just broken up
with Katy, and...

99
00:04:44,277 --> 00:04:46,122
had a couple of drinks. And...

100
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,283
I confided in the world's
worst confidant.

101
00:04:51,218 --> 00:04:52,231
<i>Okay.</i>

102
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:56,562
- Hey, Mike.
- Hey, Jim bag.

103
00:04:58,338 --> 00:05:01,260
Remember that thing I told you
on the booze cruise about Pam ?

104
00:05:01,436 --> 00:05:03,403
That was personal.

105
00:05:04,047 --> 00:05:06,160
So, if we could just keep that
between you and me,

106
00:05:06,197 --> 00:05:07,092
that would be great.

107
00:05:07,156 --> 00:05:08,170
Really ?

108
00:05:08,695 --> 00:05:10,073
- Who else knows ?
- Nobody.

109
00:05:12,908 --> 00:05:14,273
Jim and I are great friends.

110
00:05:14,346 --> 00:05:15,382
We hang out a ton.

111
00:05:16,227 --> 00:05:17,331
Mostly at work.

112
00:05:18,136 --> 00:05:20,603
But the fact that he told me
his secret and no one else,

113
00:05:20,645 --> 00:05:22,391
says everything about our friendship.

114
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:26,392
And it is why I intend on keeping
that secret,

115
00:05:26,977 --> 00:05:28,560
for as long as I possibly can.

116
00:05:30,027 --> 00:05:32,533
My lips are sealed.
"My lips are sealed." Bangles.

117
00:05:32,617 --> 00:05:34,312
All right, great, thank you.

118
00:05:34,716 --> 00:05:38,291
"Can you hear me,
<i>They talk about us,"<i>

119
00:05:39,265 --> 00:05:40,470
<i>"Telling lies"</i>

120
00:05:40,846 --> 00:05:41,951
Listen, temp,

121
00:05:43,128 --> 00:05:45,052
I am conducting
a little investigation.

122
00:05:45,457 --> 00:05:48,753
So, I am no longer gonna be able
to head up spring cleaning.

123
00:05:48,808 --> 00:05:50,322
Do you think you can handle it ?

124
00:05:50,598 --> 00:05:52,871
- Yeah, I think I can handle it. 
- Do you think...

125
00:05:53,577 --> 00:05:55,312
or do you know ?

126
00:05:55,405 --> 00:05:56,681
I think.

127
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:01,230
Oh, God. Here.

128
00:06:04,516 --> 00:06:05,820
Hey, whatcha getting ?

129
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:07,161
I'm going with grape.

130
00:06:07,885 --> 00:06:09,751
Good stuff. Good stuff.

131
00:06:11,307 --> 00:06:12,843
See the game last night ?

132
00:06:12,886 --> 00:06:14,980
- Which game ?
- Any of 'em.

133
00:06:18,207 --> 00:06:20,120
So, uh, what's the 411 ?

134
00:06:20,215 --> 00:06:22,421
Any  updates on the "P" situation ?

135
00:06:23,165 --> 00:06:24,932
- I don't know what you mean...
- P-A-M

136
00:06:24,966 --> 00:06:26,043
- Oh. Yeah. No.
- P-A...

137
00:06:26,107 --> 00:06:27,093
Oh, okay.

138
00:06:27,235 --> 00:06:28,681
No, it's okay. We're talking code.

139
00:06:29,205 --> 00:06:30,483
- What is ?
- Listen, Stan...

140
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,762
how long does it take you
for you to pick out a soda ?

141
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:35,031
- I'm gonna take off actually.
- All right, well.

142
00:06:35,346 --> 00:06:36,432
Cool.

143
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:39,530
Still deciding ?

144
00:06:42,483 --> 00:06:43,574
Peach iced tea.

145
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:46,931
You're gonna hate it.

146
00:06:47,048 --> 00:06:49,737
Hey, Oscar, how you doing ?
Dwight Schrute calling.

147
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:51,733
Listen, little question
for you, buddy.

148
00:06:51,797 --> 00:06:54,940
I called six minutes ago,
and no one answered.

149
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,923
So I as wondering
if you could explain...

150
00:06:57,646 --> 00:06:59,681
Oh, I see. So,

151
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,321
sounds like you're too sick
to come into work,

152
00:07:02,466 --> 00:07:04,650
but you're well enough
to go to the pharmacy.

153
00:07:04,696 --> 00:07:07,501
There are several different ways
to tell if a perp is lying.

154
00:07:08,075 --> 00:07:10,680
The liar will avoid
direct eye contact.

155
00:07:11,376 --> 00:07:15,591
The liar will cover part of his
or her face with his hand.

156
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:17,131
Especially the mouth.

157
00:07:17,606 --> 00:07:19,361
The liar will perspire.

158
00:07:21,197 --> 00:07:23,213
Unfortunately, I spoke
to Oscar on the phone.

159
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:24,870
So none of this is useful.

160
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:32,991
It's grrrrrape soda.

161
00:07:33,425 --> 00:07:35,851
Tony the Tiger, you don't hear
that much anymore.

162
00:07:35,927 --> 00:07:38,372
- Not so much.
- Okay, what is going on here ?

163
00:07:39,488 --> 00:07:41,473
- Nothing.
- Oh, really, nothing ?

164
00:07:42,318 --> 00:07:45,130
Fact, you are drinking grape soda.
You never drink grape soda.

165
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:48,013
Fact, you are talking to Jim,
you never talk to Jim.

166
00:07:48,096 --> 00:07:50,631
Fact, I love grape soda.
I always have.

167
00:07:50,668 --> 00:07:52,680
Fact, Jim and I talk all the time.

168
00:07:53,115 --> 00:07:54,780
We tell each other secrets.

169
00:07:54,876 --> 00:07:56,481
Okay, so what is
the secret, Michael ?

170
00:07:56,507 --> 00:07:58,543
- Well, I...
- I had asked Michael

171
00:07:58,627 --> 00:08:00,501
if I could head up
the Oscar investigation,

172
00:08:00,536 --> 00:08:02,481
and he said that only Dwight

173
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:05,930
was capable of handling
such sensitive material.

174
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:10,050
Is that true ?

175
00:08:14,277 --> 00:08:18,250
I don't know.
Uh, yeah, yeah, it is.

176
00:08:19,195 --> 00:08:20,490
Thank you Michael.

177
00:08:21,248 --> 00:08:23,113
- I know you're telling the truth.
- Okay.

178
00:08:23,177 --> 00:08:24,290
I can tell.

179
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,691
- I won't let you down.
- Good.

180
00:08:27,776 --> 00:08:28,801
Thanks.

181
00:08:31,797 --> 00:08:33,910
Nice, that was... that was slick.

182
00:08:33,977 --> 00:08:35,940
- What're you doing for lunch ?
- I don't know,

183
00:08:35,988 --> 00:08:38,243
I'm probably just gonna eat
my ham and cheese sandwich

184
00:08:38,287 --> 00:08:40,913
- in the break room.
- Nonsense. No way, no. Why don't...

185
00:08:41,157 --> 00:08:43,072
Why don't I take you
out to lunch ? My treat.

186
00:08:43,117 --> 00:08:45,131
No, that's all right.
Thank you, though. It's...

187
00:08:45,177 --> 00:08:47,771
I gotta do some cleaning.
I should probably stick around here.

188
00:08:47,795 --> 00:08:49,110
You know what we can do ?

189
00:08:49,168 --> 00:08:50,821
Spread  out a blanket
in the break room,

190
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:52,590
have a little picnic,
order some 'za.

191
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,092
Talk about you-know-who.

192
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:57,712
- Nope.
- The P, to the A, to the...

193
00:08:57,858 --> 00:09:00,531
You know what, let's go out.
That was a good idea. Let's go out.

194
00:09:00,556 --> 00:09:01,573
I know just the place.

195
00:09:04,936 --> 00:09:07,271
Oh, man. You should order milk.

196
00:09:08,408 --> 00:09:09,510
Get it ?

197
00:09:10,635 --> 00:09:12,442
Why do I like Hooters ?

198
00:09:13,246 --> 00:09:17,191
Well, I will give you two reasons.
The boobs and the hot wings.

199
00:09:19,777 --> 00:09:21,462
Oh, here we go, here we go.

200
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:24,373
- Bogie at three o'clock. Hi.
- Hey, I'm Dana. Welcome to Hooters.

201
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:27,680
We're not worthy.
We're not worthy.

202
00:09:27,886 --> 00:09:32,443
Hello, Dana. 
I am Michael, and this is Jim.

203
00:09:32,617 --> 00:09:34,443
- And we are brothers.
- Nope.

204
00:09:35,047 --> 00:09:37,012
- We're not brothers.
- I'm his boss, actually.

205
00:09:37,066 --> 00:09:38,070
And I treat him well.

206
00:09:38,116 --> 00:09:40,321
I'm taking him out to lunch
because I can afford it.

207
00:09:40,365 --> 00:09:41,972
And he can have whatever he wants.

208
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,262
I'll just have the ham and cheese
sandwich, thanks.

209
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:45,370
And for you ?

210
00:09:45,397 --> 00:09:47,451
Tell me, Dana.
How is your chicken breast ?

211
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:50,310
Oh,  it's great. It's served with
our world-famous wing sauce.

212
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:51,871
Mm, sounds yummy.

213
00:09:51,908 --> 00:09:54,861
I  will have a chicken breast.
Hold the chicken.

214
00:09:57,278 --> 00:09:58,731
Is that what you really want ?

215
00:10:02,405 --> 00:10:04,161
No, I'm gonna have
the gourmet hotdog.

216
00:10:04,225 --> 00:10:05,283
Great.

217
00:10:10,825 --> 00:10:13,292
- Who took all the black ones ?
- That's a communal bowl.

218
00:10:13,348 --> 00:10:15,830
So, how did Oscar sound
when he called in ?

219
00:10:16,265 --> 00:10:18,841
Sick. Like, lots of sniffling.
I don't know.

220
00:10:18,915 --> 00:10:20,133
Sniffling how ?

221
00:10:20,926 --> 00:10:23,522
Hum, how many different ways
are there to sniffle ?

222
00:10:23,655 --> 00:10:24,663
Three.

223
00:10:25,548 --> 00:10:27,390
Okay, it was the second one.

224
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,931
Okay, good. Thank you.

225
00:10:28,967 --> 00:10:30,461
That wasn't so hard, now was it ?

226
00:10:36,126 --> 00:10:37,871
What do you like best about Pam ?

227
00:10:38,955 --> 00:10:42,080
- I really don't wanna talk about it.
- Her legs or boobs, or... ?

228
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:45,522
She's easy to talk to, I guess.

229
00:10:46,435 --> 00:10:48,432
And, she's got a really good
sense of humor.

230
00:10:48,476 --> 00:10:49,511
Really ?

231
00:10:49,877 --> 00:10:51,682
Never gets any of my jokes.

232
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:54,030
What about you ?

233
00:10:54,145 --> 00:10:55,220
Her boobs, definitely.

234
00:10:56,565 --> 00:10:57,891
That's not what I meant.

235
00:10:58,216 --> 00:10:59,652
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

236
00:10:59,697 --> 00:11:02,242
And I understand,
we have a birthday today !

237
00:11:02,336 --> 00:11:05,713
- Oh, happy birthday, Jim.
- <i>Ready, girls ?</i>

238
00:11:05,838 --> 00:11:08,110
- Front side !
- "You put your front side in,"

239
00:11:08,158 --> 00:11:10,830
"you put your front side out,
You put your front side in,"

240
00:11:10,856 --> 00:11:12,580
"And you shake it all about"

241
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:15,391
"You do the hokey-pokey
and you turn yourself around,"

242
00:11:15,678 --> 00:11:17,332
"That's what it's all about !"

243
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,592
Thank you.

244
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,660
Thanks. Thanks Dana.

245
00:11:21,786 --> 00:11:23,152
Thank you very much.

246
00:11:26,995 --> 00:11:28,452
That was hilarious. Hey.

247
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:30,790
What did you guys talk about ?

248
00:11:31,235 --> 00:11:33,262
Just, you know, politics.
Literature.

249
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,112
I hate you.

250
00:11:37,816 --> 00:11:39,293
Quick Oscar update.

251
00:11:39,338 --> 00:11:41,761
I have conducted interviews
with everyone in the office...

252
00:11:41,787 --> 00:11:43,583
Just go to his house
and see if he's sick.

253
00:11:43,617 --> 00:11:45,911
I could've done this investigation
in like, 20 minutes.

254
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,712
- Including prep time ?
- Just do it.

255
00:11:53,487 --> 00:11:56,672
If I had to, I could clean out
my desk in 5 seconds...

256
00:11:57,068 --> 00:11:59,533
and nobody would ever know
I had ever been here.

257
00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:02,112
And I'd forget too.

258
00:12:13,856 --> 00:12:15,010
Expense this.

259
00:12:15,657 --> 00:12:16,982
Michael, is that a wig ?

260
00:12:17,995 --> 00:12:19,943
No, it's...

261
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:22,280
I wear it like that sometimes.

262
00:12:22,318 --> 00:12:24,483
- Is that a wig ?
- No.

263
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:25,692
This is from Hooters.

264
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,360
Yeah, it's a business lunch.

265
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:29,283
- Did Toby approve this ?
- No, he did not.

266
00:12:29,337 --> 00:12:31,062
I don't need his permission.

267
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,511
You just got your corporate
credit card back.

268
00:12:33,547 --> 00:12:35,442
Do you really want me
to take it away again ?

269
00:12:35,857 --> 00:12:38,432
It's ridiculous.
They took my card away because

270
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,641
I spent 80 bucks at a magic shop.

271
00:12:40,925 --> 00:12:43,842
What they don't understand
is that I bought the stuff

272
00:12:44,248 --> 00:12:45,783
to impress potential clients.

273
00:12:45,876 --> 00:12:48,272
So business-related, right ?

274
00:12:48,396 --> 00:12:51,442
I put a cigarette through
a freakin' quarter.

275
00:12:51,715 --> 00:12:54,333
And you know what, Toby ?
They almost bought from us.

276
00:12:54,675 --> 00:12:58,893
- I'm not processing this.
- Look, Jim needed a relaxing lunch.

277
00:12:58,968 --> 00:13:00,153
He has been depressed.

278
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:02,180
And it has been affecting
his productivity.

279
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,832
How is that not work-related ?

280
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:04,970
He seems fine to me.

281
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:06,800
You're not his friend.
You don't know.

282
00:13:06,858 --> 00:13:09,742
He is in love with a girl
he works with who's engaged.

283
00:13:09,796 --> 00:13:12,021
So just cut me some slack, please.

284
00:13:12,388 --> 00:13:13,323
Pam ?

285
00:13:18,828 --> 00:13:19,992
Oh, crap.

286
00:13:21,376 --> 00:13:24,133
Angela, who would you choose ?
Jim or Roy ?

287
00:13:24,157 --> 00:13:25,701
It's nobody's business, Phyllis.

288
00:13:27,658 --> 00:13:28,691
Roy.

289
00:13:29,996 --> 00:13:32,401
Jim has got it bad for Pam.

290
00:13:33,776 --> 00:13:34,953
Which one is Pam ?

291
00:13:35,866 --> 00:13:38,040
Well, she...
Hey, Michael ?

292
00:13:38,787 --> 00:13:41,161
So do you think Jim will try
to break up the wedding ?

293
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:43,621
You know what, Kevin ?
Jim is a friend of mine.

294
00:13:43,668 --> 00:13:47,662
So the only people that this crush
really concerns is Jim and Pam..

295
00:13:48,006 --> 00:13:49,230
and me.

296
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:52,631
As a volunteer sheriff's deputy,

297
00:13:52,695 --> 00:13:54,503
I've been doing surveillance
for years.

298
00:13:54,788 --> 00:13:56,021
One time,

299
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:59,683
I suspected an ex-girlfriend
of mine of cheating on me.

300
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:01,652
So I tailed her for
six nights straight.

301
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:03,452
Turns out, she was.

302
00:14:04,157 --> 00:14:06,362
With a couple of guys,
actually, so.

303
00:14:09,718 --> 00:14:10,852
Mystery solved.

304
00:14:11,358 --> 00:14:15,290
Jim, why didn't you tell me
that you had a crush on Pam ?

305
00:14:17,378 --> 00:14:18,820
Well, the cat's out of the bag.

306
00:14:18,867 --> 00:14:20,793
I used to have a crush on Pam.

307
00:14:21,205 --> 00:14:23,331
And now I... don't.

308
00:14:25,138 --> 00:14:26,211
Riveting.

309
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,822
Yeah.

310
00:14:30,276 --> 00:14:31,303
No, it's not.

311
00:14:31,388 --> 00:14:32,480
Nice.

312
00:14:34,238 --> 00:14:36,043
She is so hot.

313
00:14:41,076 --> 00:14:42,463
- Hey.
- Hey.

314
00:14:43,108 --> 00:14:44,891
Did you find anything good
in your desk ?

315
00:14:45,747 --> 00:14:47,250
Coupon for a free sandwich.

316
00:14:47,325 --> 00:14:49,191
- Score.
- Expired in August. 

317
00:14:49,357 --> 00:14:51,782
And my cell phone charger
from two years ago.

318
00:14:51,828 --> 00:14:53,253
- Big day.
- Big day.

319
00:14:54,988 --> 00:14:56,270
Hey, uh, listen.

320
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:05,183
I, told Michael
on the booze cruise...

321
00:15:06,016 --> 00:15:07,242
It was so stupid.

322
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:15,220
I told Michael, that I had had
a crush on you...

323
00:15:15,797 --> 00:15:17,930
when you first started here.

324
00:15:19,395 --> 00:15:21,270
Well, I just thought that...

325
00:15:21,936 --> 00:15:24,071
I figured you should hear it
from me.

326
00:15:25,098 --> 00:15:27,690
Rather than, I mean,
you know Michael.

327
00:15:28,896 --> 00:15:30,193
Right.

328
00:15:30,588 --> 00:15:31,963
And...

329
00:15:32,287 --> 00:15:33,661
seriously. It's...

330
00:15:34,215 --> 00:15:35,551
totally not a big deal.

331
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:36,702
Okay ?

332
00:15:38,345 --> 00:15:41,273
And when I found out that
you were engaged, I mean...

333
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,812
No, I know. Like, I kind of...

334
00:15:44,707 --> 00:15:45,802
Like, I...

335
00:15:46,106 --> 00:15:47,540
I thought that maybe you did.

336
00:15:47,938 --> 00:15:49,871
- When I first started.
- Oh, you did ?

337
00:15:50,026 --> 00:15:52,241
No, I mean, just 'cause we,
like, got along so well.

338
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,332
No, I know, yeah.
You saw through me. Great.

339
00:15:57,127 --> 00:15:59,581
So are you gonna be, like,
totally awkward around me now ?

340
00:15:59,607 --> 00:16:01,343
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

341
00:16:02,788 --> 00:16:03,972
Hope that's okay.

342
00:16:08,087 --> 00:16:09,191
And Pam.

343
00:16:09,988 --> 00:16:11,722
It was like, three years ago.

344
00:16:12,228 --> 00:16:14,922
So, I am totally over it.

345
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:17,801
Cool.

346
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,202
Okay.

347
00:16:27,698 --> 00:16:28,762
Stay low.

348
00:16:32,636 --> 00:16:34,463
This is it. There he is.

349
00:16:34,938 --> 00:16:37,581
He's been gone for at least two...
Who is that ?

350
00:16:38,696 --> 00:16:39,733
Come to Papa.

351
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,043
Oh, yes.

352
00:16:46,308 --> 00:16:47,860
Let's roll.

353
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,872
I knew it !

354
00:16:54,408 --> 00:16:57,282
Oh, man, you are so busted.

355
00:16:57,545 --> 00:17:00,080
Ice skates. Shopping bags.

356
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,370
I think I know what's going on here.

357
00:17:03,138 --> 00:17:04,891
You weren't sick at all.

358
00:17:05,046 --> 00:17:06,142
Who's this ?

359
00:17:06,186 --> 00:17:08,681
This is Dwight Schrute.
Who is this ?

360
00:17:09,727 --> 00:17:10,740
Gil.

361
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:13,043
Are you going to tell Michael ?

362
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,571
How 'bout this ?

363
00:17:14,626 --> 00:17:15,841
I don't tell Michael,

364
00:17:15,957 --> 00:17:18,803
and in exchange,
you owe me one great, big,

365
00:17:18,898 --> 00:17:24,432
giant favor redeemable by me
at a time and place of my choosing.

366
00:17:24,907 --> 00:17:26,950
Guess what I found out
about Oscar tonight ?

367
00:17:28,697 --> 00:17:30,943
He was lying about being sick.

368
00:17:31,646 --> 00:17:34,382
Should I have reported
Oscar's malfeasance ?

369
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:36,572
Probably.

370
00:17:36,626 --> 00:17:38,853
But now I know something
he doesn't want me to know.

371
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:41,183
So I can use his malfeasance...

372
00:17:41,236 --> 00:17:42,652
to establish leverage.

373
00:17:43,176 --> 00:17:47,863
Otherwise, it's just malfeasance,
for malfeasance's...s sake.

374
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:52,933
- Hey.
- I know.

375
00:17:53,766 --> 00:17:55,313
I know. I know.

376
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:01,210
- What happened ?
- I... oh. Just, you know,

377
00:18:02,528 --> 00:18:04,910
I was trying...
just the expense reports.

378
00:18:04,978 --> 00:18:07,873
And then... God, Toby,
you know ? He just...

379
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:10,033
I know. I just... 

380
00:18:11,058 --> 00:18:12,312
I just hope that...

381
00:18:12,988 --> 00:18:15,323
I just hope that this doesn't
affect our friendship !

382
00:18:18,648 --> 00:18:21,373
It's stupid. This is so stupid.

383
00:18:23,948 --> 00:18:25,473
Listen, man, it's...

384
00:18:26,235 --> 00:18:28,663
You know, it's not a big deal.
It's gonna be fine.

385
00:18:28,725 --> 00:18:30,150
No, I know. I'm good, I'm good.

386
00:18:30,365 --> 00:18:31,093
It's just...

387
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:33,252
L ook,

388
00:18:33,778 --> 00:18:36,092
it's one day.
Everything's gonna be all right.

389
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,292
- Yeah, okay.
- You good ?

390
00:18:37,328 --> 00:18:38,553
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Okay.

391
00:18:40,595 --> 00:18:42,673
Creed, did you organize
the menu book ?

392
00:18:42,908 --> 00:18:45,552
I thought that was more
on a volunteer basis.

393
00:18:46,337 --> 00:18:48,592
No, that was mandatory.

394
00:18:48,688 --> 00:18:50,703
I thought it was a volunteer thing.

395
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:58,600
Hey, here's your schedule for next week.

396
00:19:00,425 --> 00:19:01,870
- Are you okay ?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

397
00:19:01,957 --> 00:19:03,142
Look.

398
00:19:03,647 --> 00:19:05,613
- About you and Jim, I...
- Oh, no, that's...

399
00:19:05,668 --> 00:19:06,871
- You don't have to...
- No,

400
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:10,151
I just feel it's my responsibility
as your boss-slash-friend...

401
00:19:10,296 --> 00:19:11,682
No, it's really... it's okay.

402
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:15,282
I know that Jim had, like,
a crush on me when he first started.

403
00:19:15,356 --> 00:19:17,162
But that was a long time ago, so...

404
00:19:18,326 --> 00:19:20,903
It wasn't that long ago.
It was on the booze cruise.

405
00:19:22,777 --> 00:19:24,531
Jim had a crush on me
on the booze cruise,

406
00:19:24,576 --> 00:19:26,770
or he told you about it
on the booze cruise.

407
00:19:28,707 --> 00:19:32,773
Okay. Shut it, Michael. I'm done.

408
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,112
That's it, I'm out.

409
00:19:39,468 --> 00:19:40,971
- Ready ?
- Yup.

410
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,703
People are always coming to me.

411
00:19:49,748 --> 00:19:51,223
Michael, I have a secret.

412
00:19:51,377 --> 00:19:52,761
You're the only one I trust.

413
00:19:53,688 --> 00:19:54,810
No thanks,

414
00:19:54,876 --> 00:19:56,933
because keeping a secret

415
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:59,322
can only lead to trouble.

416
00:19:59,568 --> 00:20:02,872
Like, I was watching Cinemax
last weekend, this movie.

417
00:20:04,668 --> 00:20:06,131
"Portrait of a...

418
00:20:07,337 --> 00:20:08,343
Prostitute."

419
00:20:08,468 --> 00:20:09,681
Something...

420
00:20:09,727 --> 00:20:12,060
Secrets of a call...
More "Secrets of a Call Girl."

421
00:20:12,158 --> 00:20:13,932
And the lead character, Shila,

422
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:15,833
is framed for murder.

423
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:16,631
Goes on the run,

424
00:20:17,137 --> 00:20:20,180
and winds up working
at a bordello in Malibu.

425
00:20:22,235 --> 00:20:24,433
I don't... 
I don't wanna live like that.

426
00:20:25,188 --> 00:20:26,361
I like it here.

427
00:20:27,037 --> 00:20:30,190
I don't wanna be Shila.
I like being Michael Scott.

1
00:00:00,961 --> 00:00:02,532
It is Friday morning.

2
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:04,608
And it is another beautiful day,

3
00:00:04,661 --> 00:00:07,687
In Scranton, Pennsylvania.

4
00:00:09,548 --> 00:00:11,226
Oh my God !

5
00:00:16,494 --> 00:00:18,491
Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.

6
00:00:20,685 --> 00:00:22,848
We have a serious problem here.

7
00:00:23,062 --> 00:00:25,049
Alright everybody. Lock the doors.
Turn off the lights.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,525
Pretend you're not here.

9
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:27,499
Are we in danger ?

10
00:00:29,358 --> 00:00:31,170
There's no time to think about it. This is real.

11
00:00:32,593 --> 00:00:34,346
Just shh, everybody.

12
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:41,590
Michael, should I call the...

13
00:00:42,136 --> 00:00:42,906
What ?

14
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:48,672
The I.T. tech guy and me, did not
get off to a great start.

15
00:01:19,425 --> 00:01:21,711
Synchro : Occeane
Transcript : Nikki

16
00:01:23,428 --> 00:01:25,171
Yeah I tried to install it myself.

17
00:01:25,445 --> 00:01:29,423
But, you guys have these things
so password-protected.

18
00:01:29,525 --> 00:01:31,950
That just means you have
to enter your password.

19
00:01:32,568 --> 00:01:34,031
What's your password, Michael ?

20
00:01:36,488 --> 00:01:37,102
It's...

21
00:01:37,236 --> 00:01:39,220
- 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Yes.

22
00:01:46,485 --> 00:01:47,923
Michael !

23
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:50,521
- Sorry.
- Please don't do that.

24
00:01:50,585 --> 00:01:52,212
Okay, I'm sorry. What is going
on in there ?

25
00:01:52,355 --> 00:01:53,503
Why is he here ?

26
00:01:53,838 --> 00:01:54,880
What are you doing?

27
00:01:55,217 --> 00:01:56,131
I can't tell you.

28
00:01:56,198 --> 00:01:58,100
- You have to tell me.
- I don't have to tell you anything.

29
00:01:58,217 --> 00:01:59,553
Look, Michael.

30
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,513
I know you don't want
to have to think about this.

31
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:03,903
But if something were to happen to you,

32
00:02:03,955 --> 00:02:06,830
God forbid, then I would need
to know in order to take over.

33
00:02:06,987 --> 00:02:08,681
Dwight, nothing is going
to happen to me, okay ?

34
00:02:08,748 --> 00:02:09,731
I'm in the best shape of my life.

35
00:02:09,936 --> 00:02:10,871
Look at this.

36
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:13,253
Yeah, but that doesn't matter,
you could get a brain aneurysm.

37
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,463
- I'm not going to get a br-
- Or get hit by a car.

38
00:02:14,546 --> 00:02:16,000
- Stop.
- Or a bus or a train.

39
00:02:16,285 --> 00:02:17,603
You could get poisoned.
Fall down a well.

40
00:02:17,647 --> 00:02:19,271
- Step on a mine. Choke.
- Okay,

41
00:02:19,338 --> 00:02:21,530
If I step on a mine in
Scranton, Pennsylvania,

42
00:02:21,618 --> 00:02:23,000
and die, you can have my job, okay ?

43
00:02:23,558 --> 00:02:25,182
Why don't you just go away ?

44
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:28,582
There are certain things a boss
does not share with his employees.

45
00:02:29,196 --> 00:02:30,052
His salary.

46
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:32,190
That would depress them.

47
00:02:32,326 --> 00:02:33,410
His bed.

48
00:02:34,226 --> 00:02:35,022
It...

49
00:02:36,058 --> 00:02:40,460
And I am not going to tell them
that I'll be reading their e-mails.

50
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:44,741
- So how do you search ?
- By keyword phrase.

51
00:02:45,568 --> 00:02:47,560
Try profits.

52
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,602
No, try Michael Scott.

53
00:02:49,887 --> 00:02:53,451
Michael, boss, and funny.

54
00:02:56,486 --> 00:02:57,900
Oh my God !

55
00:03:00,095 --> 00:03:01,313
E-mail from Stanley.

56
00:03:01,386 --> 00:03:03,572
Stanley, terribly nice guy.

57
00:03:03,938 --> 00:03:05,493
"Sorry I didn't write back sooner."

58
00:03:05,577 --> 00:03:07,983
"I can't go to the game tonight
because my boss, Michael is an ass"

59
00:03:08,046 --> 00:03:09,122
"And making me stay late."

60
00:03:09,206 --> 00:03:11,170
Well, Stanley's an ass.

61
00:03:11,808 --> 00:03:13,072
Not one of our harder workers.

62
00:03:19,376 --> 00:03:20,721
Hey, what's the deal Michael ?

63
00:03:20,776 --> 00:03:22,283
Why are you spying on our computers ?

64
00:03:22,528 --> 00:03:26,041
Oh, no. Everybody, Oscar's gone crazy.

65
00:03:26,138 --> 00:03:28,000
What other ghost stories
have you got for us ?

66
00:03:28,205 --> 00:03:29,742
That I'm a robot ?

67
00:03:31,496 --> 00:03:34,612
I will destroy, everything in my path.

68
00:03:34,706 --> 00:03:36,912
Actually, we just...

69
00:03:38,207 --> 00:03:39,390
- Okay.

70
00:03:41,176 --> 00:03:42,581
- Oil can. Oil can.

71
00:03:45,965 --> 00:03:47,293
Tin man.

72
00:03:47,616 --> 00:03:49,730
Actually we just got a memo from I.T,

73
00:03:49,815 --> 00:03:51,743
saying you're doing e-mail surveillance.

74
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,313
Oh,  what ?
No, that defeats the whole purpose.

75
00:03:54,357 --> 00:03:56,443
So it's true ?
You have access to our e-mails ?

76
00:03:56,545 --> 00:03:57,613
You know what the problem is ?

77
00:03:57,646 --> 00:03:58,642
I think I do.

78
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:02,513
The problem is that when people
hear the term "Big Brother",

79
00:04:02,637 --> 00:04:05,320
They immediately think
it's scary or bad.

80
00:04:05,386 --> 00:04:08,512
But I don't, I think,
"Wow. I love my Big Brother".

81
00:04:08,857 --> 00:04:11,193
I gotta erase a lot of stuff.

82
00:04:11,775 --> 00:04:14,582
A LOT, of stuff.

83
00:04:14,865 --> 00:04:18,851
Oh, hey. Just so you know.
If you have any sensitive e-mails,

84
00:04:19,005 --> 00:04:20,963
they need to be deleted immediately.

85
00:04:21,175 --> 00:04:22,722
- I know.
- Good.

86
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:27,193
Hey.

87
00:04:31,185 --> 00:04:32,230
Something just happened.

88
00:04:32,387 --> 00:04:36,113
Dwight just told Angela that she has
to delete all of her sensitive e-mails.

89
00:04:36,195 --> 00:04:37,553
- Immediately !
-  What ?

90
00:04:37,818 --> 00:04:39,270
I know.

91
00:04:40,846 --> 00:04:42,452
- Do you they're like...
- No.

92
00:04:42,806 --> 00:04:43,800
Right, no.

93
00:04:50,028 --> 00:04:50,893
Maybe.

94
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:53,531
It's like squishing a
spider under a book.

95
00:04:54,788 --> 00:04:56,423
It's gonna be really gross.

96
00:04:56,495 --> 00:04:59,410
But I have to look and make
sure that it's really dead.

97
00:05:00,415 --> 00:05:01,800
So...

98
00:05:01,985 --> 00:05:03,782
If you guys see anything.

99
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:05,491
Hey, Dwight ?

100
00:05:06,837 --> 00:05:09,891
My friend is kind of into these
two girls that he works with.

101
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:10,672
Nice.

102
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,572
One is tall and brunette.

103
00:05:13,057 --> 00:05:16,191
And the other is short and blond.

104
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:18,552
And perky and kind of judgmental.

105
00:05:19,588 --> 00:05:21,851
Who do you think he should choose ?

106
00:05:22,507 --> 00:05:24,660
Does he have access to
their medical records ?

107
00:05:28,645 --> 00:05:31,082
I think on of the greatest things
about modern America,

108
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,252
is the computerization
of medical records.

109
00:05:33,807 --> 00:05:34,940
As a volunteer sheriff,

110
00:05:34,975 --> 00:05:38,360
I  can look up anyone's psychiatric
records or surgical histories.

111
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,223
Yeast infections.

112
00:05:41,695 --> 00:05:45,250
There are a huge number of
yeast infections in this county.

113
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,192
Probably,

114
00:05:48,456 --> 00:05:52,580
because we're down river,
from that old bread factory.

115
00:05:53,397 --> 00:05:57,581
Meredith has an E-vite, from Jim.

116
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:00,333
"Barbecue at Jim's tonight."

117
00:06:00,946 --> 00:06:02,240
Tonight ?

118
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:04,580
Wonder where my e-vitation is ?

119
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,693
Click on guest list.

120
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,863
Angela, Stanley, Oscar...

121
00:06:09,835 --> 00:06:12,662
Meredith, Phyllis, Kevin, Creed.

122
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,472
Must be...

123
00:06:17,596 --> 00:06:19,061
No.

124
00:06:24,145 --> 00:06:26,423
Hey, Angela. How's it going ?

125
00:06:26,618 --> 00:06:27,823
It's okay.

126
00:06:27,898 --> 00:06:30,243
Listen, are you bringing anyone 
to Jim's party tonight ?

127
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,550
No. Are we supposed to ?

128
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,691
No. I mean, I don't know.
I don't think so.

129
00:06:36,585 --> 00:06:37,501
Excuse me.

130
00:06:50,657 --> 00:06:54,491
There's always a distance between
a boss and the employees.

131
00:06:54,646 --> 00:06:57,360
It is just nature's rule.

132
00:06:57,968 --> 00:06:59,472
It's intimidation, mostly.

133
00:06:59,595 --> 00:07:02,023
It's the awareness that they are not me.

134
00:07:02,245 --> 00:07:04,363
I do think that I am very...

135
00:07:04,785 --> 00:07:08,431
approachable as one of the guys.

136
00:07:09,565 --> 00:07:12,601
But  maybe I need to be even approachabler.

137
00:07:14,678 --> 00:07:16,522
- That's pretty.
- Yeah.

138
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:20,161
Are you going to eat with us ?

139
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:22,773
Of course. Hanging with my crew.

140
00:07:23,335 --> 00:07:24,890
Crew that I am one of.

141
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:28,553
Hanging with my Cup of Noodles.

142
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,582
This is a meal in a cup, right here.

143
00:07:31,645 --> 00:07:33,890
Hot, tasty. Reminds me of college.

144
00:07:34,123 --> 00:07:36,356
Lived on this stuff.
Brain food.

145
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:39,720
You know what I really,
really miss about college ?

146
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:41,576
The parties.

147
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:45,773
Everybody'd go, the athletes,
the nerds, the professors.

148
00:07:46,307 --> 00:07:48,251
The professors would go to the parties ?

149
00:07:48,358 --> 00:07:50,573
Yeah. They were the most fun.

150
00:07:51,615 --> 00:07:53,433
We always invited them.

151
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:57,963
It's true. I'm having a party.

152
00:07:58,366 --> 00:08:00,672
I've got tree cases of imported beer.

153
00:08:01,258 --> 00:08:02,630
Karaoke machine

154
00:08:02,866 --> 00:08:04,920
And I didn't invite Michael.

155
00:08:05,095 --> 00:08:07,543
So, three ingredients for a great party.

156
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:10,343
And it's nothing personal,
I just think that if he were there,

157
00:08:10,676 --> 00:08:12,821
people wouldn't be able to
relax and you know, have fun.

158
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:15,161
And my roommate wants to meet everybody.

159
00:08:15,736 --> 00:08:18,063
Because, I'm pretty sure he
thinks I'm making Dwight up.

160
00:08:20,106 --> 00:08:21,890
He is very real.

161
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:28,510
What ?

162
00:08:32,237 --> 00:08:35,263
Oh! Yes! Thank you.

163
00:08:43,096 --> 00:08:44,250
Question.

164
00:08:44,427 --> 00:08:46,551
On the internet, there are
several different options,

165
00:08:46,597 --> 00:08:48,361
to get to your house
for the party tonight.

166
00:08:48,786 --> 00:08:51,212
No, no, no. Keep that down.

167
00:08:51,786 --> 00:08:52,940
Why ?

168
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:54,811
Because not everybody
knows about the party.

169
00:08:56,497 --> 00:08:58,571
Like who ?
Who doesn't know ?

170
00:08:59,837 --> 00:09:01,003
Michael.

171
00:09:02,335 --> 00:09:04,340
Why just Michael ?

172
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,382
Because it's a surprise.

173
00:09:07,787 --> 00:09:08,450
Is it ?

174
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:09,800
Oh, that's perfect.

175
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:11,582
So don't tell.

176
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:12,802
- I won't.
- Okay.

177
00:09:14,545 --> 00:09:17,741
So, Dwight thinks that tonight
is a surprise party for Michael.

178
00:09:18,146 --> 00:09:19,952
- Really ? That's great.
- I know.

179
00:09:20,015 --> 00:09:21,911
Maybe we can get him
to hide and wait somewhere.

180
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:24,772
Oh man.

181
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:28,022
Oh, you know what ? Speaking of which,
I was just trying to get a handle on,

182
00:09:28,116 --> 00:09:30,271
You know, the numbers
for food and stuff.

183
00:09:30,335 --> 00:09:32,341
So do you think Roy's gonna come or...

184
00:09:32,395 --> 00:09:33,663
Oh, no, he can't make it.

185
00:09:33,758 --> 00:09:35,500
Oh, okay. Cool.

186
00:09:38,455 --> 00:09:40,253
- Hey there.
- Hey.

187
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:42,162
Almost quitting time.

188
00:09:42,377 --> 00:09:44,641
Yup. It's, 4:00.

189
00:09:45,176 --> 00:09:49,542
One more hour to take care
of anything you forgot to do.

190
00:09:52,445 --> 00:09:55,301
Hey, you know, I don't know
if you have any plans tonight.

191
00:09:55,447 --> 00:09:57,281
But if you don't, we could hang out.

192
00:10:03,037 --> 00:10:04,283
- I can't.
- You have plans ?

193
00:10:04,678 --> 00:10:06,420
- Yeah, I do.
- Yeah, I do too, I do too.

194
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:08,761
- You do?
- Big plans. I do yeah.

195
00:10:08,865 --> 00:10:09,452
Because you just...

196
00:10:09,517 --> 00:10:11,423
- You wanted to hang out.
- Tonight, no I can't do it tonight.

197
00:10:11,537 --> 00:10:14,693
Improv class. I have improv class.
Hanging out with...

198
00:10:14,817 --> 00:10:16,131
- Really ?
- My improve buds.Yeah.

199
00:10:16,285 --> 00:10:17,443
Oh, that sounds like a lot of fun.

200
00:10:17,525 --> 00:10:19,072
Oh, it's the best. It's the best.

201
00:10:19,128 --> 00:10:20,951
I would not miss it for the world.

202
00:10:21,047 --> 00:10:23,193
But if something else came up,
I would definitely not go.

203
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:28,262
Improv sounds great.

204
00:10:28,797 --> 00:10:30,751
It is.

205
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,043
Okay.

206
00:10:36,116 --> 00:10:37,442
Alright.

207
00:10:38,837 --> 00:10:40,011
What ?

208
00:10:40,217 --> 00:10:42,763
I think Stanley just coughed.

209
00:10:50,657 --> 00:10:53,261
Hey, Pam. Do you need me to walk
you to your vehicular transport ?

210
00:10:53,376 --> 00:10:55,042
- No thanks.
- Alright.

211
00:10:55,305 --> 00:10:57,151
- Oscar, you have big plans tonight...
- I'm on a call.

212
00:10:57,235 --> 00:10:57,982
Okay.

213
00:10:58,066 --> 00:10:59,970
Kevin. Big man, big man !

214
00:11:00,048 --> 00:11:01,481
What are you doing tonight ? 
Where you off to ?

215
00:11:01,545 --> 00:11:02,900
My brother is in town.

216
00:11:03,027 --> 00:11:05,671
and we are going to see the 
Alaska Film Festival...

217
00:11:05,717 --> 00:11:07,171
- ...at the Si...
- Okay, alright.

218
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:10,962
Hey, Angela. Rushy, rushy. 
Where you rushing off to ?

219
00:11:11,207 --> 00:11:13,873
- I'm just leaving for the day.
-  Yeah. Where are you headed ?

220
00:11:14,527 --> 00:11:16,813
Charity. Bake Drive.

221
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:19,172
- Liar ! You are a liar.
- No, I'm not !

222
00:11:21,536 --> 00:11:24,030
Dwight. Oh, Dwight, my loyal compadre.

223
00:11:24,455 --> 00:11:26,503
You and I are hanging tonight.

224
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:31,342
The two of us. We are celebrating, 
our freedom and our manhood.

225
00:11:32,165 --> 00:11:34,300
You know what ? Why don't we watch that
 show you've been wanting to watch?

226
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,822
That stupid Battleship Galaxy.

227
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:37,902
Battlestar Galactica ?

228
00:11:38,026 --> 00:11:40,770
That's, whatever stupid show you
want to watch, we're watching it.

229
00:11:40,885 --> 00:11:44,011
Unfortunately I've got plans.
I have to go to practice.

230
00:11:45,045 --> 00:11:46,513
Soccer practice.

231
00:11:46,877 --> 00:11:48,921
I didn't know you played soccer, Dwight.

232
00:11:49,138 --> 00:11:50,283
Clarinet.

233
00:11:50,457 --> 00:11:51,981
You too, Dwight ?

234
00:11:52,556 --> 00:11:53,501
Have  fun tonight.

235
00:11:53,566 --> 00:11:57,441
Whatever it is that you're doing. 
And I'll see you Monday.

236
00:12:00,205 --> 00:12:01,342
He has no idea.

237
00:12:09,018 --> 00:12:11,330
Quick announcement everybody, 
if I can get everybody's attention.

238
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,031
We do have wine in the kitchen.

239
00:12:13,187 --> 00:12:15,722
And there is, ah, beer 
available on the porch.

240
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:18,673
nd despite what you might think,
it's not all for Meredith and Kelly.

241
00:12:18,755 --> 00:12:20,211
- So please enjoy.
- Jim !

242
00:12:20,316 --> 00:12:22,433
You really think this is a good idea ?

243
00:12:22,836 --> 00:12:24,640
A hide-a-key rock?

244
00:12:24,927 --> 00:12:26,420
Hey, you must be Dwight.

245
00:12:26,485 --> 00:12:28,581
- You don't work with us.
- That's because Mark's my roommate.

246
00:12:29,985 --> 00:12:31,672
Hey, I love the Birkenstocks.

247
00:12:31,737 --> 00:12:33,103
Thanks. Yeah.

248
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:36,312
I always keep an extra set in the car for special occasions.

249
00:12:37,237 --> 00:12:38,780
Jim, come here.

250
00:12:39,037 --> 00:12:40,862
When is the guest of honor coming ?

251
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,750
- Later-ish.
- He's going to love it !

252
00:12:44,857 --> 00:12:46,483
Great.

253
00:12:46,816 --> 00:12:50,042
I just wanted to let you guys know that
 we will be taking the tour like I promised

254
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,751
Hey ! Just in time.

255
00:12:52,185 --> 00:12:54,112
Do you want to go on a group tour ?
We were just about to leave.

256
00:12:54,157 --> 00:12:54,713
Definitely.

257
00:12:54,718 --> 00:12:57,042
Well, the group tour 
is now leaving then.

258
00:12:57,238 --> 00:12:58,360
Ladies and gentlemen !

259
00:12:58,408 --> 00:12:59,911
Just a few things that we're going
to be pointing out to you today.

260
00:13:00,136 --> 00:13:02,241
You will be able to see both bedrooms.

261
00:13:03,188 --> 00:13:05,512
If we're lucky, maybe get a chance
to peek into the bathroom.

262
00:13:05,607 --> 00:13:09,151
Who knows ? I have to remind you also
that flash photography is prohibited.

263
00:13:09,305 --> 00:13:12,313
And as much as you can, please refrain from touching things.

264
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:13,843
I know you might want to.

265
00:13:14,108 --> 00:13:15,190
Hey, is Katy coming ?

266
00:13:15,476 --> 00:13:17,033
Actually, I haven't talked
to her in a while.

267
00:13:18,388 --> 00:13:19,300
Is it cool if I call her?

268
00:13:19,807 --> 00:13:21,401
We'll talk about that later.

269
00:13:21,828 --> 00:13:24,222
Okay, let's get right into it. 
I need two people for the first scene.

270
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:26,680
Mr. Kotter.

271
00:13:26,918 --> 00:13:28,410
Mr. Kot-ter !

272
00:13:28,587 --> 00:13:30,533
Okay, Michael. And...

273
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:34,852
Anybody ? How about Marybeth ?

274
00:13:35,526 --> 00:13:37,090
- Okay.
- Come on.

275
00:13:37,777 --> 00:13:40,051
- Okay, so you start us off, Marybeth.
-Alright, great.

276
00:13:46,485 --> 00:13:48,561
Detective Michael Scarn,
I'm with the F.B.I.

277
00:13:48,758 --> 00:13:49,360
Think about this.

278
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:54,330
What is the most exciting thing that can 
happen on TV or in movies or in real life?

279
00:13:54,758 --> 00:13:56,172
Somebody has a gun.

280
00:13:57,137 --> 00:14:00,580
That's why I always start with a gun,
because you can't top it.

281
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:02,062
You just can't. 

282
00:14:02,145 --> 00:14:03,971
I'm supposed to meet my doctor here.

283
00:14:04,057 --> 00:14:06,603
Have you seen him ?
He's a very angry midget.

284
00:14:06,737 --> 00:14:09,232
Boom ! Freeze ! Michael Scoon, F.B.I.

285
00:14:09,296 --> 00:14:10,583
You know what you did

286
00:14:13,238 --> 00:14:15,742
Yeah, you thought you could get away
with your little ruse didn't you?

287
00:14:15,848 --> 00:14:18,303
Didn't you ? Well, you didn't.

288
00:14:18,366 --> 00:14:20,770
Because I know where you hid the diamonds.

289
00:14:20,835 --> 00:14:23,023
I've been on to you and 
your little friends for weeks.

290
00:14:25,258 --> 00:14:26,782
I'm  not even in the scene.

291
00:14:26,976 --> 00:14:28,370
Stop, stop ! Stop.

292
00:14:30,006 --> 00:14:31,702
- Okay, you shot me. Great. Stop.
-  Why...

293
00:14:31,818 --> 00:14:34,082
You can't just shoot 
everyone in the scene.

294
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,361
if you hadn't stopped the scene, 
you would've seen where it was going.

295
00:14:36,558 --> 00:14:37,800
Okay. What about the scene the set up ?

296
00:14:39,176 --> 00:14:40,332
No, it wasn't.

297
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:43,162
No more guns. No. No. Michael.

298
00:14:43,586 --> 00:14:45,411
I want you to give me all
the guns you have.

299
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,820
Just get rid of all your 
guns and give them to me.

300
00:14:49,307 --> 00:14:50,253
Great.

301
00:14:51,906 --> 00:14:53,061
Okay.

302
00:14:58,985 --> 00:15:00,280
Jim's bedroom.

303
00:15:04,846 --> 00:15:07,503
See, I knew we lost somebody on the tour.

304
00:15:08,515 --> 00:15:10,001
Cool. This is your desk.

305
00:15:10,068 --> 00:15:12,373
- This is my desk.
- Your home office ?

306
00:15:12,628 --> 00:15:14,662
Home office. This is it.

307
00:15:14,786 --> 00:15:17,050
Yeah. You have to sit down 
so I can get the full effect.

308
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:19,520
Okay. Sure, will do.

309
00:15:21,395 --> 00:15:23,862
Okay, wait. So that would make me...

310
00:15:25,336 --> 00:15:26,911
Like right here.

311
00:15:27,048 --> 00:15:27,811
Yeah.

312
00:15:28,288 --> 00:15:29,620
Yep, that feels about right.

313
00:15:29,707 --> 00:15:31,531
And then Dwight would be like...

314
00:15:31,658 --> 00:15:33,551
You know what ? 
Let's just leave that image out of it.

315
00:15:33,595 --> 00:15:35,072
Because this is a happy place.

316
00:15:35,207 --> 00:15:37,172
Happy thoughts, Pam. Happy thoughts.

317
00:15:40,598 --> 00:15:42,370
- Yearbook.
- Yeah, you don't have to.

318
00:15:42,928 --> 00:15:45,882
Alright, yes, that's not 
gonna be awkward at all.

319
00:15:50,756 --> 00:15:51,401
Oh, yeah.

320
00:15:51,508 --> 00:15:53,610
You were so dorky !

321
00:15:53,956 --> 00:15:55,830
Thank you.

322
00:16:02,785 --> 00:16:04,253
- Freeze !
-  I'm in.

323
00:16:04,327 --> 00:16:05,512
You want to go over the
rules one more time ?

324
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:07,253
No, no, no.

325
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:13,113
I'm looking in my wallet for money so you can tell me my fortune.

326
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,891
I promise it's worth it.

327
00:16:18,016 --> 00:16:20,312
Oh, I can see you walking out of here.

328
00:16:20,366 --> 00:16:22,253
And you're thrilled with your reading.

329
00:16:24,587 --> 00:16:26,382
What are you...

330
00:16:33,455 --> 00:16:35,663
- Michael, what did you tell him ?
- Nothing.

331
00:16:35,927 --> 00:16:38,213
Then why are his hands up ? Bill ?

332
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:42,001
He told me he couldn't show it to me, but he has a gun.

333
00:16:43,906 --> 00:16:45,810
Okay, let's call it a day.

334
00:16:45,925 --> 00:16:47,282
That was good.

335
00:16:48,587 --> 00:16:50,083
Good work, everybody.

336
00:16:50,156 --> 00:16:52,841
Angela, burger, dog ?

337
00:16:53,297 --> 00:16:54,360
Having fun?

338
00:16:54,658 --> 00:16:56,590
I got sap on me.

339
00:16:56,977 --> 00:16:58,753
Chicken, hot dog, burger.

340
00:16:59,897 --> 00:17:01,771
I'm a vegetarian.

341
00:17:02,365 --> 00:17:04,271
There's soda inside.

342
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,640
I didn't think the premium laser color 
copy batch would sell as well as it did,

343
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:08,003
would sell as well as it did.

344
00:17:08,115 --> 00:17:10,410
It surprised us all. 
I'll tell you why, because.

345
00:17:10,535 --> 00:17:13,053
I'm sorry, guys, can we 
please not talk about paper ?

346
00:17:13,505 --> 00:17:15,531
There's gotta be something
else that we can talk about.

347
00:17:23,507 --> 00:17:26,703
I think it's alright. I mean,
Jesus drank wine.

348
00:17:31,707 --> 00:17:34,163
Hey, Phyllis. Come here for a second.

349
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:35,001
Sure.

350
00:17:35,148 --> 00:17:39,521
Have you heard anything about any
secret office romances or...

351
00:17:39,836 --> 00:17:41,752
You tell me.

352
00:17:42,657 --> 00:17:44,753
Well, you do mean you and Jim, right ?

353
00:17:46,675 --> 00:17:48,360
Oh, God. I am so sorry.

354
00:17:48,457 --> 00:17:51,242
I mean, I thought, you guys 
hang out all the time.

355
00:17:51,355 --> 00:17:54,503
And you're talking all the time. 
I'm sorry, it's like...

356
00:17:54,686 --> 00:17:56,861
It's okay. It's okay.

357
00:17:59,707 --> 00:18:02,911
Not so fast, fire guy.

358
00:18:04,888 --> 00:18:06,400
How do we get to Bernie's 
Tavern from here ?

359
00:18:06,495 --> 00:18:07,992
So, Bernie's, huh?

360
00:18:06,496 --> 00:18:07,990
- Don't worry, we're all going to carpool.
- So, Bernie's ?

361
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,672
We're all going to Bernie's ?

362
00:18:10,786 --> 00:18:12,450
Sorry. We're not going as a group.

363
00:18:13,045 --> 00:18:14,612
It's just a private friend 
who happens to know

364
00:18:14,688 --> 00:18:17,281
all of us from different ways is 
throwing a private birthday thing.

365
00:18:17,278 --> 00:18:18,060
Right, right, right.

366
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:21,002
Well,  guys, I'd love to go to Bernie's
 with you but I have an office party.

367
00:18:21,108 --> 00:18:23,480
Big office party I need to go to. 
So, can't get out of it.

368
00:18:23,576 --> 00:18:24,721
- Good job.
- Hey, see you later.

369
00:18:24,815 --> 00:18:26,683
Nice job Bill.

370
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:27,900
Not.

371
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:39,563
hey, how's your new 
side project going ?

372
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,062
- Oh, yeah, I gave that up
- Really ?

373
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:45,401
Yeah. It turns out I was, 
just grasping at straws.

374
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:48,222
Just becase two people are hanging out,

375
00:18:48,307 --> 00:18:50,522
it doesn't mean that they're together.

376
00:18:50,615 --> 00:18:52,681
You know ? 
Like people can just be friends.

377
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55,323
And I think that it was really unfair of us,

378
00:18:55,357 --> 00:18:57,151
to assume that there was
anything else going on.

379
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:05,233
<i>"Just turn around now, 
'cause you're not welcome anymore."</i>

380
00:19:05,358 --> 00:19:07,703
<i>"And I- and I've got all my l..."</i>

381
00:19:07,696 --> 00:19:09,241
<i>SURPRISE ! </i>

382
00:19:11,328 --> 00:19:12,522
- Everybody.
- Dwight.

383
00:19:13,638 --> 00:19:15,763
Who opened the morgue for this thing ?

384
00:19:15,848 --> 00:19:17,540
I was just driving by. 
Thought I'd drop in.

385
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:20,422
Here's some wine. I would love a 
glass if you're gonna open it.

386
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:22,450
Hello temp. Take my jacket.

387
00:19:23,988 --> 00:19:25,983
Oh, come on. That guy ?

388
00:19:28,015 --> 00:19:30,362
He is a good guy. Not a terrorist.

389
00:19:30,956 --> 00:19:32,320
Karaoke. I love it.

390
00:19:32,447 --> 00:19:35,533
I am a karaoke fiend !

391
00:19:35,897 --> 00:19:38,353
I call dibs, I've got next. 
I've got next up.

392
00:19:38,688 --> 00:19:42,092
Come on. 
Let's, Let's get this party started !

393
00:19:43,177 --> 00:19:45,322
Okay. Where's that wine ?

394
00:19:45,355 --> 00:19:49,640
Okay, this is a duet, so, somebody else ?

395
00:19:49,736 --> 00:19:53,223
Pam, you want to...
Come up and sing this one.

396
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:56,520
Need somebody else. 
Takers, please.

397
00:19:56,795 --> 00:20:01,091
<i>"Baby when I met you there
was peace unknown"</i>

398
00:20:01,215 --> 00:20:02,021
Kelly ?

<i>"I tried to get you with a fine tooth comb"</i>

400
00:20:05,696 --> 00:20:11,571

401
00:20:11,738 --> 00:20:14,811
This is the part that goes to the, girl.

402
00:20:15,725 --> 00:20:20,241
<i>"You do something to 
me that I can't explain."</i>

403
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:05,213
Talk ! Just talk !

404
00:21:05,237 --> 00:21:06,440
- I am...
- Shut up !

405
00:21:06,535 --> 00:21:07,170
Funny story.

406
00:21:07,277 --> 00:21:09,432
They way I got into improv was,

407
00:21:09,626 --> 00:21:10,902
I got into improv,

408
00:21:11,047 --> 00:21:13,333
The story about me getting into improv was, 


409
00:21:13,445 --> 00:21:16,933
that I was walking down the street,
that I waw walking down the street.

410
00:21:17,107 --> 00:21:18,293
And the guy says : 

411
00:21:18,346 --> 00:21:20,802
"Hey, you're funny, you're the 
funniest guy I've ever seen. "

412
00:21:20,908 --> 00:21:24,171
"Or my name is not Dale Earnhardt."

413
00:21:25,347 --> 00:21:27,042
And that was an improv.

414
00:21:28,986 --> 00:21:31,531
The real way was that I found a flyer.

<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

1
00:00:05,102 --> 00:00:05,892
What ?

2
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:07,186
Oh, nothing.

3
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:10,752
Pam's on vacation.

4
00:00:10,948 --> 00:00:11,941
And she gets back tomorrow.

5
00:00:11,972 --> 00:00:13,283
So, it'll be nice to see her.

6
00:00:14,134 --> 00:00:15,715
It'll be nice. And...

7
00:00:15,736 --> 00:00:17,733
She set a date for the
wedding with Roy.

8
00:00:18,747 --> 00:00:20,137
June, summer.

9
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:21,748
So, that'll be nice.

10
00:00:23,105 --> 00:00:24,560
And that's that.

11
00:00:27,493 --> 00:00:28,796
What ?

12
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:31,340
Oh, nothing.

13
00:00:32,836 --> 00:00:36,816
Jim's been looking at me
kind of a lot all week.

14
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:39,563
I would be creeped out by it.

15
00:00:39,675 --> 00:00:42,813
But it's nothing compared to
the way Michael looks at me.

00:01:31,598 --> 00:01:33,701
Pam, plus Spam, plus...

19
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:35,232
- Hamster.
- Right.

20
00:01:35,266 --> 00:01:36,611
Welcome back.
How was your vacation ?

21
00:01:36,705 --> 00:01:39,001
- It was great.
- Yeah ? Did you get lucky ?

22
00:01:40,048 --> 00:01:41,640
Oop ! Boink.

23
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:44,150
Roy and I just got back
from the Poconos.

24
00:01:44,748 --> 00:01:46,670
I get ten vacation days a year.

25
00:01:46,768 --> 00:01:50,283
And I try to hold off taking
them for as long as possible.

26
00:01:50,447 --> 00:01:53,972
And this year I got to the
third week in January.

27
00:01:55,347 --> 00:01:57,791
I am Pam. Spicoli guy.

28
00:01:58,648 --> 00:02:00,793
Oh, God.

29
00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:02,602
He needs numbers.
Okay.

30
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:05,570
Whoa ! God !
Yuck ! Yuck, yuck, yuck.

31
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,280
- What ?
- Yuck ! Wow ! What happened in there ?

32
00:02:08,317 --> 00:02:11,473
- I don't know.
- There is stink in there. My God !

33
00:02:12,057 --> 00:02:14,840
- What is- what is that ?
- Oh, I don't know.

34
00:02:14,945 --> 00:02:17,361
- Is that a bird ?
- No, I don't think it's a bird.

35
00:02:17,618 --> 00:02:21,090
Oh, God, how could that happen ?
How could...

36
00:02:21,526 --> 00:02:23,682
- Right in the middle of the carpet.
- What's going on ?

37
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:27,220
Somebody vomited right in the
middle of the carpet in my office.

38
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:30,222
- I don't think that's vomit.
- Check it out.

39
00:02:30,348 --> 00:02:32,912
- Me ?
- Check it out.

40
00:02:34,678 --> 00:02:37,521
Don't be a wuss. Just get, no,
I'm not holding your coffee.

41
00:02:37,795 --> 00:02:39,883
- Tell me what it is.
- Oh, that's a real bitch.

42
00:02:39,968 --> 00:02:41,370
What is it ?

43
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,561
- Michael.
- What is it ?

44
00:02:43,635 --> 00:02:45,000
No, just tell me what it is.

45
00:02:45,097 --> 00:02:48,832
Michael, I gotta get outta here !
I can't hold my breath that long.

46
00:02:48,858 --> 00:02:50,662
Open the door up.

47
00:02:50,768 --> 00:02:52,943
It smelled terrible.

48
00:02:57,296 --> 00:02:59,471
Oh ! Phew !

49
00:02:59,515 --> 00:03:01,561
Oh, no !

50
00:03:02,935 --> 00:03:04,972
I cannot believe a pipe
burst and left that there.

51
00:03:05,136 --> 00:03:07,002
- That's no burst pipe.
- Well, how do you know that ?

52
00:03:07,096 --> 00:03:08,173
What is it then ?

53
00:03:08,228 --> 00:03:10,822
Hey guys ! Somebody making soup ?

54
00:03:14,165 --> 00:03:17,493
Here she comes.
All clean ? Great.

55
00:03:21,177 --> 00:03:22,732
- Too stinky.
- That is worse.

56
00:03:23,118 --> 00:03:26,152
She probably scrubbed it
into the fibers of the carpet.

57
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:28,142
Total permeation.

58
00:03:28,406 --> 00:03:30,170
I am a big fan of Fear Factor.

59
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:33,251
I'm a big fan of anything
Joe Rogan does, actually.

60
00:03:34,015 --> 00:03:36,433
So, this is sort of like
my audition tape.

61
00:03:41,775 --> 00:03:42,723
I can't stand it

62
00:03:43,268 --> 00:03:45,223
I can't stand it in here another second.

63
00:03:49,116 --> 00:03:50,921
Hey, welcome back.

64
00:03:51,085 --> 00:03:51,943
Thanks.

65
00:03:52,028 --> 00:03:54,493
So, how was the resort ?
Did you ski a lot ?

66
00:03:55,298 --> 00:03:56,393
A little.

67
00:03:57,018 --> 00:03:57,900
Good.

68
00:03:59,345 --> 00:04:00,701
What's going on here ?

69
00:04:02,996 --> 00:04:04,030
What ?

70
00:04:04,365 --> 00:04:05,663
I did not do that.

71
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:07,840
That sounds disgusting.

72
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:10,792
It wasn't me.

73
00:04:13,256 --> 00:04:14,473
It wasn't me

74
00:04:15,007 --> 00:04:16,343
It  was not me.

75
00:04:26,785 --> 00:04:27,452
Hey, Jim !

76
00:04:27,508 --> 00:04:30,640
I thought that we would be desk
buddies while they change my carpet.

77
00:04:32,177 --> 00:04:34,621
That might be a little difficult
with the one computer.

78
00:04:36,315 --> 00:04:38,052
But there's definitely
a desk open in the back.

79
00:04:38,415 --> 00:04:39,443
Yeah..

80
00:04:41,565 --> 00:04:44,363
- Which I guess I'll be taking.
- No, seriously. I don't mind sharing.

81
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:46,983
No, no, no. Seriously.
I'll be in the back.

82
00:04:51,297 --> 00:04:52,643
Hey, Kelly.

83
00:04:54,485 --> 00:04:55,852
Are you moving back here ?

84
00:04:56,097 --> 00:04:58,611
Just for the day while
Michael's at my desk.

85
00:04:58,818 --> 00:05:00,703
Because Toby used to sit there.

86
00:05:00,785 --> 00:05:03,091
But then he had to move over
there because of an allergy.

87
00:05:03,816 --> 00:05:07,280
Allergy to...the desk ?

88
00:05:07,835 --> 00:05:09,123
Weird.

89
00:05:09,956 --> 00:05:14,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ol' bullpen.

90
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:16,840
- The ol' bullpen.
-  Don't hate me.

91
00:05:17,576 --> 00:05:19,643
- Okay.
- This is great.

92
00:05:20,065 --> 00:05:21,301
Yeah.

93
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,423
The pressures of my office are insane.

94
00:05:23,606 --> 00:05:24,970
I just- you couldn't understand.

95
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,093
But you guys have it easy out here.

96
00:05:27,196 --> 00:05:29,430
You know, I used to sit right here ?

97
00:05:29,508 --> 00:05:31,280
- No way.
- Yeah

98
00:05:31,468 --> 00:05:34,030
And who had your office ?

99
00:05:34,387 --> 00:05:35,872
Ed Truck.

100
00:05:36,818 --> 00:05:39,313
Ed Truck was the manager before me.

101
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,000
Horrible. He hated fun.

102
00:05:41,147 --> 00:05:44,172
It was like, Ed Truck is walking
toward us.Stop having fun.

103
00:05:44,487 --> 00:05:46,730
Start pretending to do work.

104
00:05:46,937 --> 00:05:49,631
What a jerk. He's...You know what ?

105
00:05:50,777 --> 00:05:53,810
I swore to myself, that if I ever got to
walk around the room as manager,

106
00:05:53,935 --> 00:05:56,060
people would laugh when
they saw me coming.

107
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:58,930
And would applaud as I walked away.

108
00:05:59,407 --> 00:06:02,240
I'm serious, my closet
doors will not shut.

109
00:06:02,558 --> 00:06:05,860
I mean, it only takes so long to measure
to make sure that clothes will hang up.

110
00:06:05,896 --> 00:06:08,091
Cause  aren't all
hangers like, that big ?

111
00:06:08,215 --> 00:06:10,752
So I don't understand why the closet
engineer didn't think of that.

112
00:06:11,018 --> 00:06:12,551
So now I'm doing this new thing,

113
00:06:12,565 --> 00:06:14,561
where I just leave piles
of clothes on the floor.

114
00:06:14,778 --> 00:06:16,952
And I walk around the
piles to get an outfit...

115
00:06:17,448 --> 00:06:18,870
You know who used to sit at that desk ?

116
00:06:19,007 --> 00:06:21,470
That guy Miles who quit
to form his own company ?

117
00:06:22,276 --> 00:06:23,361
Todd Packer.

118
00:06:23,465 --> 00:06:24,172
- No.
- Yeah.

119
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:27,471
- I thought he was out on the road.
- He was, but...

120
00:06:27,925 --> 00:06:31,671
That desk was empty.
He'd come in and sit there sometimes.

121
00:06:34,118 --> 00:06:37,482
When I was in training, many years ago.
Not so long ago.

122
00:06:38,145 --> 00:06:41,422
I worked side by side with a
fellow named Todd Packer.

123
00:06:42,205 --> 00:06:45,453
And together we rocked the office.

124
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:51,491
Packer and I once spent a
whole day with our pants off.

125
00:06:51,905 --> 00:06:54,751
And when people noticed,
we convinced them that they were crazy.

126
00:06:54,845 --> 00:06:57,910
I would gladly pay you Tuesday 
for a hamburger today.

127
00:06:58,078 --> 00:06:59,653
Excuse me one second please.

128
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:02,193
What is it that you need
right now that can't wait,

129
00:07:02,197 --> 00:07:04,541
until I'm off the phone
with a customer ?

130
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:07,262
A customer. Well, sound the alarm.

131
00:07:08,787 --> 00:07:09,533
Okay.

132
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:13,152
Another time, Packer held this guy's
head in the toilet for like a minute.

133
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:16,321
Guy had no sense of humor about it.
Probably why he wasn't hired.

134
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:19,980
- What did you hit me for ?
- Oh, Charlie Horse.

135
00:07:20,115 --> 00:07:21,500
- What ?
- Charlie Horse !

136
00:07:21,635 --> 00:07:23,391
-  You shouldn't have hit me, Michael.
- Okay !

137
00:07:23,715 --> 00:07:28,103
Once, as a joke Packer banged
every chick in the office.

138
00:07:28,326 --> 00:07:30,553
It was hysterical.

139
00:07:31,105 --> 00:07:36,151
Beyonce, pink the color,
Pink the person, hot dogs,

140
00:07:36,296 --> 00:07:38,330
Basically anything that is awesome.

141
00:07:38,488 --> 00:07:40,240
- Sno-cones...
- Hey, Jim.

142
00:07:40,317 --> 00:07:43,682
Michael wanted me to ask you
how to raise your desk chair.

143
00:07:43,998 --> 00:07:47,580
- It's the lever on the side.
- That's what I told him. Thanks.

144
00:07:52,503 --> 00:07:55,786
Oh, my God. He is so cute.

145
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:59,530
Would you talk to him for
me and see if he likes me ?

146
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:03,756
- No, I don't think I can.
- Please Jim. Please, please, Jim

147
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,002
Please, please ? He's so cute.
I like him so much.

148
00:08:07,135 --> 00:08:10,041
And I would do it, but I'm too shy.
Please, Jim ? Please, please.

149
00:08:10,306 --> 00:08:13,731
Please ? Please, Jim, please ?
Please, please ?

150
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,433
- Dwight.
- Michael.

151
00:08:17,486 --> 00:08:20,942
- Let's set up accounting.
- What ?

152
00:08:21,388 --> 00:08:24,571
Old-fashioned raid.
Sales on accounting.

153
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,510
Follow my lead.

154
00:08:28,885 --> 00:08:31,120
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Michael.

155
00:08:31,215 --> 00:08:32,883
- What's up ?
- Hey, Dwight.

156
00:08:42,297 --> 00:08:44,471
Come on, come on !

157
00:08:46,566 --> 00:08:48,440
- Sales rule !
- Yes !

158
00:08:48,576 --> 00:08:50,352
Yeah, yeah !

159
00:08:53,037 --> 00:08:55,233
- Should we help them pick up their stuff ?
- No, no... 

160
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,802
We don't do that.
We don't do that.

161
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,902
Watch out Pam. You're next.

162
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:00,722
You're gonna throw my
things on the ground ?

163
00:09:00,826 --> 00:09:02,633
Maybe.

164
00:09:02,826 --> 00:09:05,222
<i>What happened in Michael's
office is wrong.</i>

165
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,303
I understand it. It makes sense.

166
00:09:10,815 --> 00:09:13,192
But it's, but it was still wrong.

167
00:09:13,338 --> 00:09:16,150
Why would somebody ruin
a perfectly good carpet ?

168
00:09:17,745 --> 00:09:19,671
I don't know.

169
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:24,912
Could have been done out of hate.
Could be done out of love

170
00:09:25,415 --> 00:09:27,881
It could be completely neutral.

171
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,121
Maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady.

172
00:09:30,296 --> 00:09:33,092
Well, she doesn't do a
very good job, obviously.

173
00:09:33,178 --> 00:09:37,801
because my office still reeks
like you would not believe.

174
00:09:38,507 --> 00:09:41,050
I hate her.

175
00:09:43,398 --> 00:09:45,372
You know what ?
I am beginning to think,

176
00:09:45,598 --> 00:09:49,551
that what happened to my carpet was
an act of terrorism against the office.

177
00:09:49,858 --> 00:09:53,001
Against the office.
The only thing that makes sense.

178
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,482
Hello, am I the 107th caller ?

179
00:09:58,908 --> 00:10:01,400
Hello, Rock 107, am I the 107th caller ?

180
00:10:04,956 --> 00:10:07,450
Hello, Rock 107,
am I the 107th caller ?

181
00:10:09,205 --> 00:10:10,583
I'm totally going to
win us that box set.

182
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:12,783
Stop. Stop it.

183
00:10:15,558 --> 00:10:17,530
Stop it.

184
00:10:19,665 --> 00:10:20,972
Don't.

185
00:10:21,696 --> 00:10:22,850
Don't.

186
00:10:23,407 --> 00:10:24,930
I need to make a sales call.

187
00:10:27,366 --> 00:10:29,050
- Please.
- All right.

188
00:10:39,686 --> 00:10:41,161
Am I the 107th caller ?

189
00:10:41,828 --> 00:10:43,672
<i>That is so soon.</i>

190
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,493
<i>We'll go back. We'll go back
in a couple weeks, baby.</i>

191
00:10:46,697 --> 00:10:49,523
- <i>Yeah, right.</i>
- <i>Okay, maybe another month then<i>

192
00:10:49,658 --> 00:10:51,650
Maybe for, like, Presidents'
Day or something.

193
00:10:51,788 --> 00:10:53,500
<i>We can do a three day weekend.</i>

194
00:10:53,608 --> 00:10:58,573
<i>And maybe when we get back, I can call
in sick, and get a four day weekend.</i>

195
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:01,831
<i>And when I wake up, I feel fine.</i>
</i>It's so weird.</i>

196
00:11:02,075 --> 00:11:04,690
<i>And I just hate it. 'Cause
I try to go to bed at, like,</i>

197
00:11:04,778 --> 00:11:05,933
- <i>Are you kidding?</i>

198
00:11:06,336 --> 00:11:07,300
Hi, guys.

199
00:11:07,438 --> 00:11:09,980
We haven't finished getting things
in order from your last visit.

200
00:11:10,118 --> 00:11:11,763
- I'm just walking around.
- Were you ?

201
00:11:11,896 --> 00:11:12,781
Well, yeah.

202
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,711
It's just that we're really
swamped over here Michael.

203
00:11:14,828 --> 00:11:16,502
I'm not ? Why would you say that ?

204
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:18,261
Because I'm having fun ?

205
00:11:18,285 --> 00:11:21,421
You guys just are working for
the weekend, aren't you ?

206
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:23,833
I'm working for the week.
Sales team.

207
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:27,003
Listen to me.
This is what we're gonna do.

208
00:11:27,786 --> 00:11:30,200
I'm gonna up the ante
a little bit literally.

209
00:11:30,418 --> 00:11:32,913
Right here, I'm going to
put a crisp $100 bill.

210
00:11:33,086 --> 00:11:35,761
The person with the most sales at the
end of the day gets to keep the cash.

211
00:11:35,937 --> 00:11:37,513
Sound good ?

212
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,871
70, 80, 1, 2, 3.

213
00:11:40,258 --> 00:11:42,853
$83. Still a lot of money.

214
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:47,350
And I'm going to...
I'm going to leave it right over here.

215
00:11:47,866 --> 00:11:49,962
Where everybody can see it.

216
00:11:50,537 --> 00:11:54,950
I will be taking Jim's clients today,
because he is not here.

217
00:11:55,127 --> 00:11:58,023
And out of sight, out of the contest.

218
00:11:58,178 --> 00:11:59,832
Let's see who winds up
with the cash, shall we ?

219
00:11:59,897 --> 00:12:03,253
- You're going to compete against us ?
- Oh, it is on, Phyllis ! It is so on !

220
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:05,911
- It is so on !
- God, this is gonna be fun.

221
00:12:07,495 --> 00:12:10,291
Michael is gonna wipe the floor with us.

222
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:22,252
So you have 40 boxes going out.

223
00:12:22,285 --> 00:12:24,480
And I will deliver those
personally in the Sebring.

224
00:12:24,805 --> 00:12:27,450
Very good. Nice doing business
with you. Thank you.

225
00:12:27,905 --> 00:12:29,813
Yes !!

226
00:12:31,026 --> 00:12:33,521
Yeah. Read it and weep.

227
00:12:34,275 --> 00:12:36,423
Look at that. Look at me Phyllis.

228
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:38,530
Oh, what is that ?
That's my sale.

229
00:12:46,697 --> 00:12:48,451
- What what's that ? What you doing ?
- Nothing.

230
00:12:48,555 --> 00:12:50,370
- I think he's dancing.
- No, just...

231
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,621
- That was definitely not dancing.
- You know what, guys ?

232
00:12:52,755 --> 00:12:55,270
It's none of your concern.
It was official business. So just...

233
00:12:55,426 --> 00:12:57,471
- Paper business ?
- Yeah, paper business. Is this done ?

234
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:58,860
N ope.

235
00:12:59,118 --> 00:13:01,932
Extreme Home Makeover puts
together a house in an hour.

236
00:13:02,016 --> 00:13:04,611
If you were on that crew,
you'd be fired like that.

237
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,731
Somebody did something
bad to Michael's carpet.

238
00:13:09,446 --> 00:13:11,332
Maybe that's all we need to know.

239
00:13:17,976 --> 00:13:20,013
- Who do you think did it ?
- Are you kidding ?

240
00:13:20,086 --> 00:13:22,660
- I thought it was you.
- Really ? I thought you.

241
00:13:31,028 --> 00:13:32,452
This was no act of God.

242
00:13:32,538 --> 00:13:35,380
A person did this.
A person who works in this office.

243
00:13:35,586 --> 00:13:37,590
Maybe all of them.

244
00:13:38,296 --> 00:13:39,651
You know what ?

245
00:13:39,946 --> 00:13:43,531
Today is not a good
day for a sales contest.

246
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:46,780
- We're-we're not doing this today.
- That doesn't seem fair.

247
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:50,320
You want to talk about fair ?
Does anyone need to smell my old carpet?

248
00:13:51,105 --> 00:13:54,103
You explain to me how that was fair. And
I'll explain to you how this is fair.

249
00:13:54,607 --> 00:13:58,243
Plus, I just, I think that picking today
was sort of taking advantage.

250
00:13:58,328 --> 00:14:02,050
- But you're the one who picked today.
- I am a victim of a hate crime.

251
00:14:03,227 --> 00:14:04,790
Stanley knows what I'm talking about.

252
00:14:04,828 --> 00:14:09,022
- That's not what a hate crime is.
- Well, I hated it, a lot, okay ?

253
00:14:09,135 --> 00:14:11,011
I, you know what ?

254
00:14:11,148 --> 00:14:14,811
If the guilty person would just come
forward and take their punishment...

255
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,010
We'd be done.

256
00:14:21,158 --> 00:14:23,350
Very well. Then you're all punished.

257
00:14:23,566 --> 00:14:25,692
- What's our punishment ?
- You're all on time out.

258
00:14:27,295 --> 00:14:29,121
Just sit there quietly.

259
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:41,550
Hey.

260
00:14:41,828 --> 00:14:43,501
- What's up ?
- Nothing much.

261
00:14:44,396 --> 00:14:45,760
Let me ask you something.

262
00:14:45,807 --> 00:14:47,773
It's actually a little awkward.

263
00:14:47,897 --> 00:14:50,803
What do you think of Kelly ?

264
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,912
I don't know.

265
00:14:53,265 --> 00:14:55,351
Depends if you like a little junk in...

266
00:14:57,425 --> 00:14:58,861
She's really cool.

267
00:14:58,935 --> 00:15:01,263
- Are you interested in her ?
- Yeah, totally.

268
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:03,253
- Really ?
- Did she say something ?

269
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,033
She said lots of things.

270
00:15:05,407 --> 00:15:08,051
Do you know if she's looking
for a long-term thing ?

271
00:15:08,095 --> 00:15:10,861
Or if she'd be cool just, hanging out ?

272
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,223
- I have no idea.
- Can you find out ?

273
00:15:16,367 --> 00:15:17,171
Yeah.

274
00:15:18,157 --> 00:15:19,131
Sure.

275
00:15:21,146 --> 00:15:22,582
Long-term, definitely.

276
00:15:22,748 --> 00:15:26,142
Fall in love, have babies,
spend every second together.

277
00:15:26,457 --> 00:15:27,661
But don't tell him that, okay ?

278
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:29,770
Just tell him I'm, like,
up for anything.

279
00:15:29,817 --> 00:15:31,550
I mean, I'm not a slut, but who knows.

280
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:33,421
Do you remember Ed Truck ?

281
00:15:33,825 --> 00:15:35,813
Sure, he hired me. 
How's he doing ?

282
00:15:36,786 --> 00:15:38,142
How would I know ?

283
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:39,342
I thought you might.

284
00:15:40,048 --> 00:15:41,643
My biggest fear is turning into him.

285
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:44,242
Michael, you should have
much bigger fears than that.

286
00:15:44,966 --> 00:15:46,902
I wasn't talking literally, Creed.

287
00:15:47,316 --> 00:15:49,162
Yeah, being buried alive would be worse.

288
00:15:49,356 --> 00:15:50,893
Happy ? Why am I talking to you ?

289
00:15:51,846 --> 00:15:52,452
Ed !

290
00:15:52,855 --> 00:15:54,173
Hi,  thanks for meeting me.

291
00:15:55,868 --> 00:15:57,800
Must be kind of neat coming back.

292
00:15:58,175 --> 00:15:59,673
Yeah. Shall we go upstairs ?

293
00:16:00,148 --> 00:16:02,710
Well, honestly, Ed, I really don't
want to be up there right now.

294
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,092
So, what's the problem with my pension ?

295
00:16:06,858 --> 00:16:08,022
No, no, no. You're good.

296
00:16:08,076 --> 00:16:09,543
It was clerical. You're good.

297
00:16:10,525 --> 00:16:12,750
Well, somebody did
something in my office.

298
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,943
And I now think that they did it on
purpose and it was directed at me.

299
00:16:16,037 --> 00:16:17,253
But what was done ?

300
00:16:17,447 --> 00:16:20,101
I didn't get a good look at it.

301
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,661
But it smells horrible.

302
00:16:23,428 --> 00:16:26,211
Yeah, somebody once
did that in my office.

303
00:16:27,105 --> 00:16:27,801
- Really.
- Yeah.

304
00:16:27,845 --> 00:16:28,801
Well, that figures.

305
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:32,761
So how did you deal with
people not liking you ?

306
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:35,310
You can't expect to be
friends with everybody.

307
00:16:36,848 --> 00:16:37,733
- sure I can.
- No.

308
00:16:37,888 --> 00:16:39,802
They'll always think
of you as a boss first.

309
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,651
Not necessarily.

310
00:16:41,856 --> 00:16:43,900
You can love a boss
like you do a father.

311
00:16:44,225 --> 00:16:45,661
I'm not sure that ever happens.

312
00:16:45,765 --> 00:16:48,963
Well, ok, different management styles.

313
00:16:49,026 --> 00:16:51,220
Why can't your workers be your workers ?

314
00:16:51,405 --> 00:16:54,092
Family be your family,
your friends be your friends ?

315
00:16:54,928 --> 00:16:57,943
Last week, I would've given a
kidney to anyone in this office.

316
00:16:58,555 --> 00:17:01,811
I would have reached right into my
stomach and pulled it our for them.

317
00:17:01,927 --> 00:17:03,483
But now, no.

318
00:17:03,535 --> 00:17:06,562
<i>I don't have a relationship with
these people that I thought I did.</i>

319
00:17:06,887 --> 00:17:08,860
<i>I hope they ask.</i>

320
00:17:08,948 --> 00:17:12,313
<i>So they can hear me say " : no."</i>

321
00:17:12,788 --> 00:17:15,280
I only give my organs
to my real friends.

322
00:17:15,418 --> 00:17:17,431
Get yourself a monkey kidney.

323
00:17:18,307 --> 00:17:22,061
Hey, Brenda, this is,
Jim Halpert from the boat.

324
00:17:22,957 --> 00:17:25,513
And I got your number from
the corporate directory.

325
00:17:25,885 --> 00:17:29,012
And, well, I'm assuming that
you probably gave it to them,

326
00:17:29,057 --> 00:17:32,643
because you wanted
me to ask you out, right ?

327
00:17:33,207 --> 00:17:35,331
So give me a call back.

328
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:37,560
You can get my number
from said directory,

329
00:17:38,107 --> 00:17:42,690
Or just check your email
cause I just sent you one.

330
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:47,921
Yikes. Give me a call back, I hope.

331
00:17:48,118 --> 00:17:51,563
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

332
00:17:53,098 --> 00:17:55,681
You just asked a girl out on the phone !

333
00:17:57,988 --> 00:17:58,783
Yup.

334
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:02,472
Yes.

335
00:18:02,676 --> 00:18:06,593
<i>Hello. Yes. I'm looking for a gay
nerd named Michael Scott.</i>

336
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:08,952
Who is this ?
How did you get this number ?

337
00:18:09,116 --> 00:18:11,102
<i>Your mom, you gay nerd.</i>

338
00:18:11,267 --> 00:18:15,930
Oh my God. Packer. Packster !
Wacky Pack. How you doing ?

339
00:18:16,126 --> 00:18:19,401
<i>Hey, listen, did you get
that package I left for you ?</i>

340
00:18:20,465 --> 00:18:23,742
No. Did anybody see a
package here today ?

341
00:18:24,277 --> 00:18:26,901
- No, how big was it ?
- <i>It was pretty big.</i>

342
00:18:27,128 --> 00:18:28,393
- Really ?
- Yeah.

343
00:18:28,456 --> 00:18:31,172
Did you see a big package ?
Where did you leave it ?

344
00:18:31,186 --> 00:18:33,972
- <i>Left it in the middle of your office.</i>
- Realy ?

345
00:18:34,145 --> 00:18:36,732
Guys, did you see a big
package in my office ?

346
00:18:38,198 --> 00:18:40,622
You mean the thing ?

347
00:18:43,627 --> 00:18:45,363
Are you kidding me ?

348
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,750
- <i>Special delivery.</i>
- That was Packer !

349
00:18:49,925 --> 00:18:53,630
You are dead, you are dead, my friend.

350
00:18:53,738 --> 00:18:58,082
That is hila- Oh God !
Of course it was you.

351
00:18:58,418 --> 00:19:02,913
- <i>Sit on the throne, Michael.</i>
- Yeah, yeah !

352
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:06,080
Oh my God. It was Packer.

353
00:19:06,206 --> 00:19:09,553
It takes an advanced sense of humor.
I don't expect everybody to understand

354
00:19:10,018 --> 00:19:12,342
It was done out of love,
just like I thought.

355
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:16,242
It's, God, these people are so,
these are good people

356
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:20,771
We have fun. We just have fun.

357
00:19:21,438 --> 00:19:24,490
I'm just so sorry that
I threw the thing out.

358
00:19:34,596 --> 00:19:39,092
- <i>You have 7 unheard messages.</i> 
<i>- Hey, Jim, It's Pam.</i>

359
00:19:39,587 --> 00:19:41,183
<i>I keep looking up to say
something to you,</i>

360
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,192
<i>and then Michael's there.
And it's horrible.</i>

361
00:19:43,656 --> 00:19:46,450
<i>Anyway, I'm bored. Come back.</i>

362
00:19:46,616 --> 00:19:50,181
<i>Hey, guess what. I moved my computer
so I can't see Michael's head.</i>

363
00:19:50,377 --> 00:19:51,981
<i>It's working.
I think I can have a career,</i>

364
00:19:52,106 --> 00:19:54,502
<i>as a very specific type of decorator.</i>

365
00:19:54,946 --> 00:19:58,832
<i>Sudoku. Level, moderate. Time,
18 minutes. Suck on that Halpert.</i>

366
00:20:00,357 --> 00:20:02,203
<i>I'll  transfer you.</i>

367
00:20:02,298 --> 00:20:04,860
<i>Dunder Mifflin this is Pam.</i>
<i>Hold, please.</i>

368
00:20:05,945 --> 00:20:07,641
<i>Dunder Mifflin, this is. Okay, sorry.</i>

369
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,640
<i>Michael was standing at my
desk and I needed to be busy.</i>

370
00:20:09,857 --> 00:20:12,213
<i>Or who knows what would've
happened. So thank you.</i>

371
00:20:12,507 --> 00:20:15,673
<i>What's that word we made up for when
you have a thing stuck in your shoe ?</i>

372
00:20:16,037 --> 00:20:19,183
<i>Anyway, I have a thing
stuck in my shoe.</i>

373
00:20:19,295 --> 00:20:20,991
<i>I have a chance to sneak
out of here early,</i>

374
00:20:21,158 --> 00:20:23,900
<i>And I'm not messing this
up so I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

375
00:20:24,007 --> 00:20:25,672
<i>Calling from my cell phone.</i>

376
00:20:25,716 --> 00:20:28,392
<i>I don't know if you guys figured out
who did that to Michael's carpet yet.</i>

377
00:20:28,448 --> 00:20:31,662
<i>But I have a theory that it involves
an interdepartmental conspiracy.</i>

378
00:20:32,238 --> 00:20:34,862
Everybody in the office.
We need to talk.

<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

1
00:00:03,474 --> 00:00:05,010
- Hey.
- Hello.

2
00:00:06,576 --> 00:00:08,023
- Jim !
- What's up buddy ?

3
00:00:08,097 --> 00:00:10,320
This is not funny.
Why is my stuff in here ?

4
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:11,483
Wow, that's weird.

5
00:00:11,528 --> 00:00:13,541
Ooh, dollar for a stapler,
that's pretty good.

6
00:00:13,571 --> 00:00:15,864
Yeah, well, I'm not paying
for my own stuff, okay ?

7
00:00:15,909 --> 00:00:18,967
I know you did this 'cause you're
friends with the vending machine guy.

8
00:00:18,996 --> 00:00:20,503
- Who, Steve ?
- Yeah, Steve.

9
00:00:20,577 --> 00:00:22,844
What do I want ?
What do I want ?

10
00:00:24,637 --> 00:00:25,732
It's a pencil cup.

11
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:29,178
Oh, no, no, no, no.
That's my pencil cup.

12
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,081
Um, I don't think so,
I just bought it.

13
00:00:31,508 --> 00:00:34,498
Uh, I think so, and you're
going to hand it over to me.

14
00:00:34,638 --> 00:00:35,891
I love these.

15
00:00:36,656 --> 00:00:37,952
Okay, fine.

16
00:00:39,445 --> 00:00:40,840
My wallet ?

17
00:00:41,578 --> 00:00:43,691
Um, oh, there it is. J1.

18
00:00:46,155 --> 00:00:47,150
I don't have any...

19
00:00:47,235 --> 00:00:49,522
Here you know what,
you can have some nickels.

20
00:00:52,727 --> 00:00:54,081
5, 10.

21
00:00:56,235 --> 00:00:59,410

Saison 2 - Episode 11
Booze Cruise

23
00:01:28,027 --> 00:01:31,323
Transcripts : Nikki (twiztv.com)
Synchronisation : El Uploador

24
00:01:32,776 --> 00:01:34,193
Hello everyone.

25
00:01:34,568 --> 00:01:35,563
Morning Michael.

26
00:01:35,605 --> 00:01:37,141
Where are we going
this afternoon ?

27
00:01:40,115 --> 00:01:43,652
Last week, Michael sent out
this mysterious memo.

28
00:01:43,867 --> 00:01:46,060
"It's time for our first quarter
camaraderie event."

29
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:48,253
"So pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush."

30
00:01:48,326 --> 00:01:49,470
"Rubber-soled shoes..."

31
00:01:49,906 --> 00:01:51,010
"...and a ski mask."

32
00:01:51,235 --> 00:01:53,322
A ski mask and a swimsuit ?

33
00:01:54,356 --> 00:01:56,480
So that he can have us rob a bank,

34
00:01:56,948 --> 00:01:58,581
and then escape through the sewers.

35
00:01:59,437 --> 00:02:00,732
And brush our teeth.

36
00:02:02,537 --> 00:02:03,640
Yeah ?

37
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,523
- Michael...
- Stanley...bo banley.

38
00:02:06,705 --> 00:02:08,613
- I need to know-
-  Banana fana fo fanley.

39
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,272
- What we're doing.
- Me mi mo manley.

40
00:02:10,337 --> 00:02:12,151
- You said bring a toothbrush.
- Stanley.

41
00:02:12,385 --> 00:02:13,580
Is this an overnight ?

42
00:02:14,478 --> 00:02:18,570
Maybe. The suspense is just
so exciting, isn't it ?

43
00:02:18,796 --> 00:02:21,252
Should my wife tell her boss
she's not coming in tomorrow ?

44
00:02:21,276 --> 00:02:23,741
- Maybe, I don't know.
- Not maybe, yes or no.

45
00:02:23,838 --> 00:02:25,372
Well, no, but...

46
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:28,800
okay, don't spoil it for everybody.
All right ? But, we...

47
00:02:30,445 --> 00:02:34,443
are going on a booze cruise
on Lake Wallenpaupack.

48
00:02:36,536 --> 00:02:37,962
In January ?

49
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:40,390
It's cheaper.

50
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:42,091
This is not just another party.

51
00:02:42,136 --> 00:02:44,950
This is a leadership
training exercise.

52
00:02:45,797 --> 00:02:46,833
Right ?

53
00:02:46,897 --> 00:02:48,861
I'm going to combine
elements of fun

54
00:02:49,055 --> 00:02:52,020
and motivation and education
into a single,

55
00:02:52,345 --> 00:02:54,211
mind-blowing experience.

56
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:58,730
It is now time to unveil the
destination of this year's retreat.

57
00:03:00,037 --> 00:03:04,772
We are going on a harbor cruise
of Lake Wallenpaupack.

58
00:03:10,938 --> 00:03:13,600
- It's a booze cruise !
- All right !

59
00:03:14,918 --> 00:03:17,062
I have a test for business school
tomorrow night.

60
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,862
Is it okay if I skip the cruise
and study for that ?

61
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,782
No, this is mandatory.

62
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:24,572
But don't worry, you know what ?
You're going to learn plenty.

63
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:27,241
This is going to turn your
life around, Ryan.

64
00:03:27,328 --> 00:03:29,842
I'm already in business school.

65
00:03:29,935 --> 00:03:31,070
- Wait, Michael.
- Yeah?

66
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:33,473
Why did you tell us to bring
a bathing suit ?

67
00:03:33,848 --> 00:03:35,132
To throw you off the scent.

68
00:03:35,328 --> 00:03:36,723
Yeah, but I bought a bathing suit.

69
00:03:36,778 --> 00:03:39,292
Well, just keep the tags on
and you can return it.

70
00:03:39,397 --> 00:03:40,723
I took the tags off already.

71
00:03:40,756 --> 00:03:42,193
Well, that's not my fault, okay ?

72
00:03:42,245 --> 00:03:44,553
Just-we're not going to pay
for a bathing suit.

73
00:03:44,888 --> 00:03:46,893
Okay. I know what
you're all thinking.

74
00:03:46,945 --> 00:03:48,701
Who is this smart little cookie ?

75
00:03:48,837 --> 00:03:50,463
Her name is Brenda...

76
00:03:50,695 --> 00:03:52,662
...something,
and she is from corporate.

77
00:03:52,936 --> 00:03:55,813
And she is here, like you,
to learn from what I have to say.

78
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,742
I am a great motivational speaker.

79
00:03:57,808 --> 00:04:01,440
I attended a Tony Robbins
event by the airport last year,

80
00:04:01,795 --> 00:04:02,881
and...

81
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:06,730
It wasn't the actual course.
You have to pay for the actual course.

82
00:04:07,266 --> 00:04:10,733
But, it talked about
the actual course.

83
00:04:11,577 --> 00:04:16,123
And I've incorporated a lot
of his ideas into my own course.

84
00:04:17,107 --> 00:04:19,021
Leader...ship.

85
00:04:20,436 --> 00:04:24,981
The word ship is hidden inside
the word leadership.

86
00:04:25,705 --> 00:04:27,591
As its derivation.

87
00:04:28,016 --> 00:04:31,903
So, if this office is
in fact a ship,

88
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:34,591
as it's leader...

89
00:04:35,385 --> 00:04:36,751
I am the captain.

90
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:40,290
But...We're all in the same boat.

91
00:04:40,436 --> 00:04:41,520
Teamwork.

92
00:04:41,596 --> 00:04:45,290
Last  year, Michael's theme was
"bowl over the competition."

93
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,182
So, guess where we went ?

94
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:52,250
Now, on this ship
that is the office,

95
00:04:53,287 --> 00:04:54,921
what is the sales department ?

96
00:04:56,365 --> 00:04:57,441
Anyone ?

97
00:04:57,765 --> 00:05:00,481
How about, the sales department
is the sails ?

98
00:05:00,696 --> 00:05:04,251
Yes, Darryl, the sales department
makes sales. Good.

99
00:05:04,826 --> 00:05:09,170
Let me just explain. I see the sales
department as the furnace.

100
00:05:09,986 --> 00:05:12,270
- A furnace ?
- Yeesh, how old is this ship ?

101
00:05:12,806 --> 00:05:13,910
How about the anchor ?

102
00:05:14,157 --> 00:05:15,660
What does the furnace do ?

103
00:05:15,756 --> 00:05:17,770
All right, let's not get hung up
on the furnace.

104
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,890
This just...

105
00:05:19,015 --> 00:05:21,460
It's the sales. I see the sales
department are down there,

106
00:05:21,506 --> 00:05:24,600
they're in the engine room and they
are shoveling coal into the furnace,

107
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,312
right ?

108
00:05:25,545 --> 00:05:27,072
I mean who saw
the movie "Titanic" ?

109
00:05:27,107 --> 00:05:29,133
They were very important
in the movie "Titanic".

110
00:05:29,185 --> 00:05:30,411
Who saw it ?
Show of hands ?

111
00:05:30,845 --> 00:05:32,881
Not really sure what movie
you're talking about.

112
00:05:32,925 --> 00:05:35,040
- You sure you got the title right ?
-  "Titanic" ?

113
00:05:35,105 --> 00:05:37,363
I think you're thinking of
"The Hunt for Red October".

114
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,580
No, I'm...
Leo DiCaprio, come on !

115
00:05:39,777 --> 00:05:41,500
Michael stands in the front
of the boat

116
00:05:41,545 --> 00:05:44,022
and says he's king of the world
within the first hour,

117
00:05:44,526 --> 00:05:46,060
or I give you my next paycheck.

118
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:49,711
Michael,  everyone in the
engine room drowned.

119
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:51,990
No, thank you, spoiler alert.

120
00:05:52,106 --> 00:05:54,212
You saw the movie,
those of you who did.

121
00:05:56,077 --> 00:05:57,980
They're happy down there
in the furnace room.

122
00:05:58,047 --> 00:06:00,782
And they're dirty and
grimy and sweaty.

123
00:06:00,895 --> 00:06:03,933
And they're singing
their ethnic songs. And...

124
00:06:04,796 --> 00:06:07,241
Actually, that might be warehouse.

125
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:09,760
- What ?
- The, no, no.

126
00:06:10,545 --> 00:06:11,821
No I didn't...

127
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,243
okay, well, the...

128
00:06:13,296 --> 00:06:16,590
Okay, in a nutshell what
I'm saying is leadership.

129
00:06:16,747 --> 00:06:19,460
We'll get, we'll talk more
about that on the boat. Ship.

130
00:06:20,237 --> 00:06:21,411
Aye, aye, Captain.

131
00:06:21,575 --> 00:06:25,690
<i>A three hour tour.
A three hour tour.</i>

132
00:06:25,726 --> 00:06:27,752
<i>Pam, you are Mary Ann.</i>

133
00:06:27,807 --> 00:06:30,283
We have...
The Professor and Ginger.

134
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:31,790
Welcome aboard.

135
00:06:31,835 --> 00:06:34,471
Angela, you are Mrs. Howell. Lovey.

136
00:06:34,788 --> 00:06:35,931
Uh, the native.

137
00:06:36,155 --> 00:06:37,790
Sometimes they come
from neighboring...

138
00:06:37,827 --> 00:06:40,672
Oh, uh, we have, uh...
one of the Globetrotters.

139
00:06:40,718 --> 00:06:42,190
I am the Skipper,

140
00:06:42,267 --> 00:06:44,581
and Dwight, you will be Gilligan.

141
00:06:44,636 --> 00:06:46,693
- Cool.
- Actually, I'm the Skipper.

142
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:49,021
- But you can be Gilligan.
- Oh, I'd rather die.

143
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:50,663
Hi, I am Michael Scott.

144
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:52,558
I am the Captain of this party.

145
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,891
I'm Captain Jack.
I'm Captain of the ship.

146
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:57,538
I'm also captain of anyone
who sets foot on this ship.

147
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:58,630
Hi, welcome aboard.

148
00:06:59,155 --> 00:07:00,011
Okay.

149
00:07:00,126 --> 00:07:02,213
In an office, when you are
ranking people,

150
00:07:02,427 --> 00:07:04,962
manager is higher than captain.

151
00:07:05,665 --> 00:07:08,423
Oh a boat, who knows ?
It's nebul-ose.

152
00:07:10,136 --> 00:07:11,192
Hey look.

153
00:07:11,235 --> 00:07:14,092
I'm king of the world !

154
00:07:22,466 --> 00:07:23,743
Okay, all right.

155
00:07:24,786 --> 00:07:25,861
Welcome aboard.

156
00:07:25,937 --> 00:07:27,761
I am your captain, Captain Jack.

157
00:07:27,856 --> 00:07:32,340
And I am Regional Manager of
Dunder Mifflin, Michael Scott.

158
00:07:32,515 --> 00:07:33,542
Welcome, welcome.

159
00:07:33,577 --> 00:07:35,251
- Okay, so, um...
- Okay, so.

160
00:07:35,395 --> 00:07:37,651
Please. The, uh, life preservers.

161
00:07:37,696 --> 00:07:40,792
They are located underneath the seats
all along the perimeter of the boat.

162
00:07:40,816 --> 00:07:41,812
But don't worry,

163
00:07:41,846 --> 00:07:44,182
you are not going to be needing
life preservers tonight.

164
00:07:44,236 --> 00:07:46,703
Well, we might just be, okay ?
Please let me finish, okay ?

165
00:07:46,736 --> 00:07:47,793
Thank you.

166
00:07:47,898 --> 00:07:50,912
So, the Coast Guard requires that
I tell you where the safety exits are.

167
00:07:50,956 --> 00:07:54,143
Now, on this ship, it's very easy.
Anywhere over the sides.

168
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:59,012
Not only am I your ship's captain,
I am also your party captain !

169
00:07:59,135 --> 00:08:01,743
Woo, we're going to get it
going here in just a few minutes...

170
00:08:01,785 --> 00:08:03,133
And I'm your party captain too !

171
00:08:03,187 --> 00:08:05,613
And you are going to put on
your dancing shoes later on.

172
00:08:05,638 --> 00:08:07,320
- Hey, Mike, Mike.
- So we are gonna...

173
00:08:07,378 --> 00:08:09,480
- Uh, if you don't mind.
- Rock it !

174
00:08:09,616 --> 00:08:11,260
- What ?
- Please, okay ?

175
00:08:11,985 --> 00:08:14,651
If the boat's a-rocking,
don't come knocking.

176
00:08:14,718 --> 00:08:15,530
- Michael.
- Yup.

177
00:08:15,737 --> 00:08:17,033
Uh, your company employees

178
00:08:17,085 --> 00:08:19,271
are not the only people
on the boat tonight, okay ?

179
00:08:19,296 --> 00:08:21,160
We're all going to have
a good time tonight.

180
00:08:22,205 --> 00:08:24,101
Why don't you let me and
my crew do our job ?

181
00:08:24,188 --> 00:08:25,862
You just sit back and
have a good time ?

182
00:08:25,897 --> 00:08:27,502
- Okay, yup.
- All right ?

183
00:08:28,795 --> 00:08:32,231
You guys, it's like we're in high
school and we're at the cool table.

184
00:08:33,215 --> 00:08:34,363
- Right ?
- Yeah.

185
00:08:34,865 --> 00:08:36,081
Pam, were you a cheerleader ?

186
00:08:36,118 --> 00:08:39,621
No, she was total little Miss
Artsy Fartsy in high school.

187
00:08:40,046 --> 00:08:41,892
She wore the turtleneck
and everything.

188
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:43,031
That's hilarious.

189
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:45,141
It's not hilarious, but...

190
00:08:45,718 --> 00:08:47,610
- Where'd you go to school ?
- Bishop O'Hara.

191
00:08:47,636 --> 00:08:49,012
Piss slop who cares-a ?

192
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,312
We played you.

193
00:08:51,818 --> 00:08:53,302
You, you really look familiar.

194
00:08:53,337 --> 00:08:55,911
Did you, uh, you cheered
for them, didn't you ?

195
00:08:55,986 --> 00:08:57,083
Mmm, no.

196
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,101
Yes, I did.

197
00:09:00,118 --> 00:09:03,153
A-W-E... S-O-M-E,

198
00:09:03,505 --> 00:09:06,981
awesome, awesome is what we are
we're the football superstars.

199
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:08,682
-  A-W-E
- I remember that !

200
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:11,071
- S-O-M-E
- We crushed you like 42 to 10.

201
00:09:11,438 --> 00:09:12,832
-  Having fun ?
- Yeah.

202
00:09:13,925 --> 00:09:15,540
Everybody's really nice.

203
00:09:15,605 --> 00:09:18,713
Good, well, that is what
Scranton is all about.

204
00:09:19,516 --> 00:09:21,082
Not like you "New Yawkers."

205
00:09:21,688 --> 00:09:23,870
When are you going to
start the, uh, presentation ?

206
00:09:23,968 --> 00:09:26,270
Well, I already sort of started it
back at the office.

207
00:09:26,336 --> 00:09:28,211
And on the dock
with the Gilligan thing.

208
00:09:28,457 --> 00:09:30,141
So, right now, I was thinking.

209
00:09:30,698 --> 00:09:32,283
Yes. Okay !

210
00:09:32,308 --> 00:09:35,292
Listen up, all you,
Dunder Mifflinites.

211
00:09:35,686 --> 00:09:39,890
I would like to talk to you
all about life preservers.

212
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:45,090
Now,  one important life preserver
in business is IT Support.

213
00:09:45,615 --> 00:09:48,140
Not now, Mike, we're
doing the limbo !

214
00:09:48,195 --> 00:09:52,283
Ha, ha, that's right, partiers.
It's time to limbo, limbo, limbo !

215
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:53,910
- So, okay.
- All right !

216
00:09:53,956 --> 00:09:56,291
I need a volunteer to come up here
and hold my stick.

217
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,851
- Huh, who's it going to be ?
-  Me.

218
00:09:57,886 --> 00:09:59,131
- Okay.
- Me, me, me.

219
00:09:59,176 --> 00:10:00,372
Me, me, me.

220
00:10:02,486 --> 00:10:03,590
Usually it's a woman.

221
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:05,692
- I'm stronger.
- Hey, I got an idea.

222
00:10:06,336 --> 00:10:08,670
How would you like to steer
the ship, Dwight ?

223
00:10:09,118 --> 00:10:10,803
Keep us on a steady course.

224
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:12,830
Keep a sharp eye out,
I'm counting on you.

225
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,523
I was the youngest pilot
in Pan Am history.

226
00:10:15,568 --> 00:10:17,040
When I was four,

227
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,040
the pilot let me ride
in the cockpit,

228
00:10:19,087 --> 00:10:21,470
and fly the plane with him.

229
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:24,300
And I was four and I was great !

230
00:10:24,356 --> 00:10:25,520
And I would have landed it,

231
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:27,572
but my dad wanted us
to go back to our seats.

232
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:33,130
All right, all right.
That was great,

233
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:35,663
now it's time for
the dance contest !

234
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:38,711
Why don't we do that after
I do my presentation and...

235
00:10:38,757 --> 00:10:41,091
Nope ! Dance contest !

236
00:10:41,126 --> 00:10:44,410
All right, we'll have a motivational
dance contest. Hit it !

237
00:10:44,827 --> 00:10:48,581
Yeah, okay. Dancing.

238
00:10:48,918 --> 00:10:53,663
It is a primal art form used
in ancient times

239
00:10:54,326 --> 00:10:56,520
to express yourself with the body.

240
00:10:59,088 --> 00:11:00,252
And communicate.

241
00:11:11,428 --> 00:11:12,920
Sometimes you have
to take a break

242
00:11:12,966 --> 00:11:15,023
from being the kind of boss

243
00:11:15,055 --> 00:11:17,163
that's always trying
to teach people things.

244
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:20,293
Sometimes you just have to
be the boss of dancing.

245
00:11:31,228 --> 00:11:34,263
What do you do with
a drunken sailor

246
00:11:34,425 --> 00:11:37,430
What do you do with
a drunken sailor

247
00:11:38,146 --> 00:11:41,102
What do you do with
a drunken sailor

248
00:11:41,228 --> 00:11:44,430
Ear-ly in the morn-ing

249
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:48,690
Hey, come inside and talk to me.

250
00:11:48,928 --> 00:11:52,193
I can't. Do you want us
to run aground woman ?

251
00:11:54,227 --> 00:11:57,150
Snorkel shot, snorkel shot !

252
00:11:57,536 --> 00:12:00,120
Snorkel shot, snorkel shot !

253
00:12:00,405 --> 00:12:01,521
Snorkel shot !

254
00:12:04,097 --> 00:12:06,561
Who's next ?
Come on, Pammy, come on, come on !

255
00:12:06,596 --> 00:12:08,490
- I'm not doing that.
- Come on !

256
00:12:09,238 --> 00:12:10,190
Tequila !

257
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:13,303
That's what I'm talking about.

258
00:12:13,325 --> 00:12:16,091
Hey, why don't we find like,
a quieter place to hang out ?

259
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,792
You know what, I've just gotta
wait for Darryl to do his shot.

260
00:12:18,816 --> 00:12:21,290
Just a minute.
Come on, Darryl, Darryl !

261
00:12:21,735 --> 00:12:23,423
It's getting kind of rowdy
down there.

262
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,822
Yeah.
"Darryl, Darryl, Darryl."

263
00:12:29,788 --> 00:12:31,652
Sometimes, I just don't get Roy.

264
00:12:33,615 --> 00:12:34,630
Well.

265
00:12:37,897 --> 00:12:39,491
I mean, I don't know.

266
00:12:48,538 --> 00:12:49,603
So.

267
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,650
What's it like dating
a cheerleader ?

268
00:13:19,525 --> 00:13:20,591
I'm cold.

269
00:13:31,817 --> 00:13:34,011
So, what's this presentation
all about ?

270
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,611
Ah, see, this is of
general interest.

271
00:13:37,236 --> 00:13:39,650
It is about...priorities.

272
00:13:39,866 --> 00:13:43,203
And making decisions,
using the boat as an analogy.

273
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:44,563
What is important to you ?

274
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:47,241
If the boat is sinking,
what do you save ?

275
00:13:47,695 --> 00:13:50,011
- Women and children.
- No, no.

276
00:13:50,157 --> 00:13:51,732
Salesmen and profit centers.

277
00:13:52,335 --> 00:13:53,652
That's a stupid analogy.

278
00:13:53,727 --> 00:13:58,262
O-kay, well obviously you don't
know anything about leadership.

279
00:13:59,468 --> 00:14:02,313
Well, I was the captain of a
PC-1 Cyclone Coastal Patrol Boat

280
00:14:02,348 --> 00:14:03,491
during Desert Storm.

281
00:14:03,686 --> 00:14:06,503
Wow, you should be the
motivational speaker.

282
00:14:06,996 --> 00:14:08,533
Him ?
O-kay.

283
00:14:08,616 --> 00:14:11,250
Yeah, he gives me real
responsibility, Michael.

284
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:12,673
Captain Jack delegates.

285
00:14:12,937 --> 00:14:15,180
He's let me steer the ship
for the last hour.

286
00:14:17,108 --> 00:14:18,442
I'd like to be engaged.

287
00:14:19,356 --> 00:14:21,122
How did you manage
to pull that off ?

288
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,963
Uh, I've been engaged for
three years,

289
00:14:26,188 --> 00:14:27,552
and there's no end in sight.

290
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:29,752
So, you don't want to ask
my advice.

291
00:14:30,397 --> 00:14:32,473
Suppose your office
building's on fire.

292
00:14:32,848 --> 00:14:34,353
Jim, who would you save ?

293
00:14:36,946 --> 00:14:38,221
Let's see...

294
00:14:41,177 --> 00:14:42,272
the customer.

295
00:14:42,485 --> 00:14:43,813
Cause the customer is king.

296
00:14:43,886 --> 00:14:45,892
Not what I was looking for,
but a good thought.

297
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,703
He's just sucking up.

298
00:14:47,765 --> 00:14:49,523
When you were in the Navy,

299
00:14:49,827 --> 00:14:51,610
did you, um, ever almost die ?

300
00:14:51,695 --> 00:14:54,570
Oh yeah, oh yeah. And I wasn't
thinking about some customer.

301
00:14:54,887 --> 00:14:56,672
I was thinking about my first wife.

302
00:14:57,278 --> 00:14:59,562
The day I got back on
shore, I married her.

303
00:15:04,328 --> 00:15:06,603
You know what,
I would save the receptionist.

304
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,363
I just wanted to clear that up.

305
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:16,320
Hey, everybody, uh, could I have
your attention for just a second ?

306
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,971
Would you listen to me
for a second ?

307
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,353
We were up at the front

308
00:15:19,396 --> 00:15:21,972
and we were talking about
what's really important and...

309
00:15:22,266 --> 00:15:23,652
Pam, um,

310
00:15:24,538 --> 00:15:26,040
I think enough is enough.

311
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,142
I think we should set a date
for our wedding.

312
00:15:28,257 --> 00:15:29,573
How about June 10th ?

313
00:15:29,768 --> 00:15:30,870
Come on, let's do it.

314
00:15:32,037 --> 00:15:33,101
Come on baby !

315
00:15:33,137 --> 00:15:34,993
Oh, my God, congratulations !

316
00:15:35,965 --> 00:15:37,303
Congratulations.

317
00:15:38,676 --> 00:15:39,682
Yes !

318
00:15:40,277 --> 00:15:41,342
Oh, my God !

319
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:42,552
I love you baby, come on !

320
00:15:42,576 --> 00:15:43,520
Congratulations !

321
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:52,271
Come on, I don't want
to take credit for this,

322
00:15:52,308 --> 00:15:55,373
but Roy and I were just having
a conversation about

323
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:59,590
making commitments and making
choices, right ?

324
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,822
Did I motivate you ?

325
00:16:00,856 --> 00:16:02,610
No, it was, it was Captain Jack.

326
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:04,403
- Well....
- Captain Jack !

327
00:16:05,338 --> 00:16:06,693
Could have been either one of us

328
00:16:06,738 --> 00:16:08,970
because, pretty much, we were
saying the same thing.

329
00:16:09,008 --> 00:16:10,581
Congratulations, that is great.

330
00:16:10,617 --> 00:16:11,923
We gotta celebrate !

331
00:16:15,047 --> 00:16:17,630
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
I got an idea, I got an idea.

332
00:16:17,896 --> 00:16:20,643
I can marry you right now
as captain of the ship, huh ?

333
00:16:20,987 --> 00:16:24,163
I can marry you as Regional
Manager of Dunder Mifflin !

334
00:16:24,488 --> 00:16:27,031
No, no, no, no, I want my mom
and dad to be there.

335
00:16:27,147 --> 00:16:28,620
Then, I'll give you away !

336
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:30,500
No, thank you.

337
00:16:37,098 --> 00:16:38,712
Do you think that'll ever be us ?

338
00:16:39,338 --> 00:16:40,343
No.

339
00:16:42,316 --> 00:16:43,462
What is wrong with you ?

340
00:16:43,497 --> 00:16:45,413
Why did you even bring me
here tonight ?

341
00:16:45,855 --> 00:16:47,082
I don't know.

342
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:48,773
Let's break up.

343
00:16:49,748 --> 00:16:51,161
Wh-what ! ?

344
00:16:52,048 --> 00:16:54,500
This is where old Captain Jack
drives the boat.

345
00:16:57,468 --> 00:16:58,163
Seasick ?

346
00:16:58,736 --> 00:17:00,713
Captain Jack says you
should look at the moon.

347
00:17:00,746 --> 00:17:02,492
Captain Jack's a fart face.

348
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,022
I'm on medication.

349
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,520
Really ? What ?

350
00:17:10,035 --> 00:17:11,130
Vomicillin.

351
00:17:14,945 --> 00:17:17,272
Okay, all right,
it's time to be boss.

352
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,633
Time to motivate,
let's blow some minds here.

353
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,510
Okay guys, guys, guys, cool it.

354
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:24,093
Everybody. Dunder Mifflin
and Scranton employees.

355
00:17:24,157 --> 00:17:28,490
Brenda. I have some very, very,
urgent news I need to tell everybody.

356
00:17:28,806 --> 00:17:30,193
Right now, listen up.

357
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:32,472
The ship, is sinking.

358
00:17:33,465 --> 00:17:34,590
Okay ?

359
00:17:34,645 --> 00:17:36,422
We're going down, right now.

360
00:17:36,475 --> 00:17:39,122
Just wrap your heads
around the reality of that.

361
00:17:39,786 --> 00:17:42,423
Shh, please, everybody, it's my
turn now, okay ?

362
00:17:42,465 --> 00:17:43,641
Captain Jack is gone.

363
00:17:43,707 --> 00:17:47,810
In five minutes, this ship is going
to be at the bottom of the lake.

364
00:17:48,296 --> 00:17:50,910
And there aren't enough
spaces on the lifeboats.

365
00:17:50,978 --> 00:17:52,672
Who are we going to save ?

366
00:17:52,987 --> 00:17:54,730
Do we save sales ?

367
00:17:54,975 --> 00:17:56,973
Do we save customer service ?

368
00:17:57,047 --> 00:17:58,810
Do we save accounting ?

369
00:17:59,005 --> 00:18:01,630
This is a business scenario, right ?

370
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,062
It's a scary...

371
00:18:03,107 --> 00:18:05,401
- What the hell's going on here ?
- It's a predicament.

372
00:18:05,438 --> 00:18:09,031
And it's something that each and
everyone of us have to think about.

373
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:11,100
I'm in the brig, see ?

374
00:18:12,836 --> 00:18:15,040
Boat's not as corporate
friendly as advertised.

375
00:18:16,706 --> 00:18:18,762
What is the deal with the guy
jumping overboard ?

376
00:18:18,785 --> 00:18:19,873
What was...

377
00:18:20,155 --> 00:18:23,453
If he had just waited and
heard what I had to say,

378
00:18:23,886 --> 00:18:26,323
he would be motivated right now
and not all wet.

379
00:18:41,658 --> 00:18:42,922
Somebody there ?

380
00:18:45,948 --> 00:18:47,420
What happened to you ?

381
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,110
Captain Jack has a problem
with authority.

382
00:18:52,486 --> 00:18:55,240
Oh, right, 'cause you announced
that his ship was sinking ?

383
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:58,050
Yeah, he just totally lost it.

384
00:18:58,885 --> 00:19:00,661
If you ask me, he caused the panic.

385
00:19:05,835 --> 00:19:07,150
What a night.

386
00:19:08,297 --> 00:19:10,490
Well, it's nice for you.
Your friend got engaged.

387
00:19:10,556 --> 00:19:12,022
She was always engaged.

388
00:19:12,078 --> 00:19:13,612
Roy  said the first one
didn't count.

389
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:16,410
That's...great.

390
00:19:19,906 --> 00:19:21,882
You know, to tell you
the truth, I...

391
00:19:23,065 --> 00:19:24,852
used to have a big
thing for Pam.

392
00:19:25,285 --> 00:19:26,273
So...

393
00:19:26,585 --> 00:19:28,172
Really ?
You're kidding me.

394
00:19:30,598 --> 00:19:31,822
You and Pam ?

395
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,073
I would have never...

396
00:19:36,346 --> 00:19:39,193
put you two together.
You really hid it well, God !

397
00:19:40,287 --> 00:19:42,641
I usually have a radar
for stuff like that.

398
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:47,140
You know, I made out with Jan.

399
00:19:47,178 --> 00:19:48,700
- Yeah, I know.
- Yeah ? Yep.

400
00:19:49,347 --> 00:19:50,681
Well, Pam is cute.

401
00:19:51,296 --> 00:19:52,322
Yeah.

402
00:19:53,578 --> 00:19:55,182
She's really funny and...

403
00:19:55,878 --> 00:19:58,490
She's warm and she's just...

404
00:20:00,285 --> 00:20:01,303
Anyway.

405
00:20:01,738 --> 00:20:04,222
Well, if you like her so much, uh,

406
00:20:04,318 --> 00:20:05,430
don't give up.

407
00:20:07,876 --> 00:20:09,032
She's engaged.

408
00:20:09,658 --> 00:20:11,440
B.F.D. Engaged ain't married.

409
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,133
Never, ever, ever give up.

410
00:20:25,986 --> 00:20:27,183
Don't worry, Michael.

411
00:20:27,845 --> 00:20:29,273
I'm taking us to shore.

412
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:31,482
It's a fake wheel, dummy.

1
00:00:03,054 --> 00:00:04,538
Go, in the door..

2
00:00:04,931 --> 00:00:06,108
Push !

3
00:00:06,245 --> 00:00:07,353
Push !

4
00:00:07,425 --> 00:00:09,254
No no no! Turn it around.
Turn it around, you're breaking.

5
00:00:09,323 --> 00:00:10,193
Shove it, breaking !

6
00:00:10,397 --> 00:00:12,598
You shove it! Shove it back !

7
00:00:15,335 --> 00:00:16,803
Here we go.

8
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,638
Don't break the branches, Dwight.

9
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:23,215
Ah, I got a splinter.

10
00:00:23,326 --> 00:00:24,990
Well, suck it up, we all have problems.

11
00:00:25,063 --> 00:00:26,576
Hey everybody.

12
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:28,570
Look what we have !

13
00:00:30,846 --> 00:00:32,096
Nice, huh ?

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,192
- I've got it leveraged. Push !
- One three.

15
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:37,063
- Straight up.
- Ready, one, two, three.

16
00:00:40,867 --> 00:00:42,223
Merry Christmas !

17
00:01:08,008 --> 00:01:10,202
Episode 210- Season 2
CHRISTMAS PARTY

18
00:01:10,456 --> 00:01:12,752
Catch 22 team :
El uploador, Keyshawn, Occeane, Unfold
Script: Nikki (twiztv.com)

19
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:15,432
http://pmag.f2o.org/theofficeus/
www.forom.com

20
00:01:19,648 --> 00:01:21,260
Did it work ?

21
00:01:21,537 --> 00:01:23,513
Well, sort of.

22
00:01:24,546 --> 00:01:26,212
Why did you get it so big ?

23
00:01:26,718 --> 00:01:28,422
'A', that's what she said.

24
00:01:28,527 --> 00:01:29,863
And 'B',

25
00:01:30,038 --> 00:01:31,190
I wanted it to be impressive.

26
00:01:31,268 --> 00:01:33,561
he biggest day of the year deserves
the biggest tree of the year.

27
00:01:34,235 --> 00:01:36,371
But what are we going to do
with this hacked off part ?

28
00:01:36,498 --> 00:01:39,030
Well, that is a perfectly
good mini tree Kevin.

29
00:01:39,597 --> 00:01:42,201
And we are going to
sell that to charity.

30
00:01:42,678 --> 00:01:44,500
That's what Christmas is all about.

31
00:01:52,996 --> 00:01:54,582
<i>So this year,
for the first time ever...</i>

32
00:01:54,678 --> 00:01:56,702
I got Pam in Secret Santa.

33
00:01:56,918 --> 00:01:58,580
And I got her this, teapot.

34
00:01:58,807 --> 00:02:00,420
Which I know she really wants.

35
00:02:00,517 --> 00:02:01,721
So she can make tea at her desk.

36
00:02:01,785 --> 00:02:04,621
but I'm also gonna stuff
it with some inside jokes.

37
00:02:04,977 --> 00:02:06,301
Like...

38
00:02:06,757 --> 00:02:08,521
This is my high school yearbook photo.

39
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:11,653
She saw it at the party,
and it really makes her laugh.

40
00:02:12,355 --> 00:02:13,373
I'm not sure why.

41
00:02:14,428 --> 00:02:15,631
What else?

42
00:02:16,347 --> 00:02:17,821
This is hot sauce packet.

43
00:02:18,408 --> 00:02:21,120
She put this on a hot dog
a couple of years ago.

44
00:02:21,246 --> 00:02:23,011
Because she thought it was ketchup

45
00:02:24,266 --> 00:02:25,742
And, it was really funny.

46
00:02:25,847 --> 00:02:27,801
So I kept the other two.

47
00:02:28,238 --> 00:02:30,440
This would take a little
too long to explain.

48
00:02:30,555 --> 00:02:31,643
So I won't.

49
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,572
And this is a card.

50
00:02:34,778 --> 00:02:38,013
Because Christmas is the time
to tell people how you feel.

51
00:02:41,446 --> 00:02:42,981
Is there anything we're missing ?

52
00:02:43,187 --> 00:02:44,451
Phyllis, you got the lights ?

53
00:02:44,556 --> 00:02:46,293
Yes, I got those cute little ones.

54
00:02:48,216 --> 00:02:49,932
Do you think I should have
gotten the big ones ?

55
00:02:50,006 --> 00:02:51,060
We'll see.

56
00:02:51,715 --> 00:02:54,780
<i>Angela, drafted me into the
party planning committee.</i>

57
00:02:54,876 --> 00:02:59,070
Her memo said that we need to
prepare for every possible disaster.

58
00:03:00,445 --> 00:03:03,771
Which to me seems...excessive.

59
00:03:04,305 --> 00:03:06,853
Merry Christmas !

60
00:03:08,277 --> 00:03:08,971
Pimp !

61
00:03:10,128 --> 00:03:10,950
I'm kidding.

62
00:03:11,045 --> 00:03:13,193
What do we got ? What do we got ?
How many plates are we getting ?

63
00:03:13,268 --> 00:03:13,840
Fifty.

64
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:14,971
Double it. Double everything.

65
00:03:15,077 --> 00:03:17,132
Double ice cream.
Double napkins. Double it.

66
00:03:17,295 --> 00:03:18,620
On me.

67
00:03:18,935 --> 00:03:20,331
<i>It was a tough year</i>

68
00:03:20,395 --> 00:03:21,603
<i>I had to fire somebody this year.</i>

69
00:03:21,726 --> 00:03:23,703
This party has to really rock.

70
00:03:24,656 --> 00:03:26,070
Check it out.

71
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,213
Christmas bonus.
Three-thousand G's.

72
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:30,382
I got this for helping save
the company money

73
00:03:31,818 --> 00:03:34,303
So I guess some good came
out of firing Devin after all.

74
00:03:35,528 --> 00:03:37,433
Maybe  I should call him, tell him that.

75
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,640
I want people to cut loose.

76
00:03:39,668 --> 00:03:42,153
I want people...making out in closets.

77
00:03:43,548 --> 00:03:47,670
I want, I want people hanging from
the ceilings, lampshades on the heads

78
00:03:47,736 --> 00:03:50,490
I want it to be a Playboy Mansion party.

79
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,460
And also, I want you to know,

80
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,720
and spread the word, that
I will have my digital camera.

81
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,613
And I will be taking
pictures all along the way.

82
00:03:57,725 --> 00:04:00,013
And the best and craziest
thing that happens,

83
00:04:00,136 --> 00:04:02,003
will be on the cover of the newsletter.

84
00:04:02,046 --> 00:04:02,772
Incentive.

85
00:04:02,806 --> 00:04:05,102
You do realize that we can't
serve liquor at the party.

86
00:04:05,156 --> 00:04:06,841
Yeah, I know. Dammit.

87
00:04:07,278 --> 00:04:09,030
Stupid corporate wet blankets.

88
00:04:09,158 --> 00:04:10,843
Like booze ever killed anybody.

89
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:13,690
One, two, three.

90
00:04:15,717 --> 00:04:17,280
You guys should use a hand truck.

91
00:04:18,268 --> 00:04:19,892
Do we have one ?

92
00:04:20,465 --> 00:04:21,563
No.

93
00:04:24,517 --> 00:04:26,491
Will you help me ?

94
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,800
No. No way.

95
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:29,853
It- no.

96
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:31,723
Come on, Mike. Let me borrow the hat.
For just a couple of hours.

97
00:04:31,796 --> 00:04:33,200
- You wanna be Santa ?
- Yeah.

98
00:04:33,265 --> 00:04:34,833
Have you ever seen Santa ?

99
00:04:34,935 --> 00:04:37,020
Yeah, I've SEEN Santa. Who cares ?

100
00:04:37,147 --> 00:04:39,271
Okay, well, I'm sorry.
It just doesn't work.

101
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:40,492
Michael !

102
00:04:40,885 --> 00:04:42,573
I would like to be the elf.

103
00:04:42,935 --> 00:04:45,941
That makes sense, because
he has elfish features.

104
00:04:47,785 --> 00:04:49,443
Okay, everyone, listen up !

105
00:04:49,687 --> 00:04:51,830
It is time, to get your presents.

106
00:04:52,177 --> 00:04:55,183
Wrap them, and place them under the tree.

107
00:04:56,217 --> 00:04:57,841
Like so.

108
00:04:58,395 --> 00:05:00,601
If you do not get your present wrapped,

109
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:02,943
and under the tree within
the next five minutes,

110
00:05:03,885 --> 00:05:05,932
you  will be disqualified
from Secret Santa.

111
00:05:06,448 --> 00:05:08,283
All right ? No exceptions.

112
00:05:08,366 --> 00:05:09,690
Except Michael.

113
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:11,410
I got Angela.

114
00:05:11,825 --> 00:05:14,733
She's into these posters of babies...

115
00:05:15,308 --> 00:05:17,520
dressed as adults.
I got her one of those.

116
00:05:18,966 --> 00:05:21,622
I felt kind of weird buying that.

117
00:05:22,005 --> 00:05:23,151
I got Creed.

118
00:05:23,246 --> 00:05:25,220
And to tell you the truth,
I don't know anything about Creed.

119
00:05:25,518 --> 00:05:28,330
know his name's Creed.
I know he works right over there.

120
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,351
I think he's Irish and I...

121
00:05:31,055 --> 00:05:34,060
I got him this, uh, shamrock keychain.

122
00:05:35,465 --> 00:05:37,660
I got myself for Secret Santa.

123
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:41,391
I was suppose to tell
somebody, but I didn't.

124
00:05:43,395 --> 00:05:45,933
You get something good this year

125
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:47,423
I think I did a pretty good job.

126
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:49,591
Who'd you have ? 

127
00:05:49,706 --> 00:05:51,650
I can't tell you, 'cause it's a secret.

128
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:53,333
think I got something
pretty nice for my guy.

129
00:05:53,398 --> 00:05:55,412
- Yeah ?
- Spent a lot of dough. A lot of dough.

130
00:05:55,546 --> 00:05:56,451
Wow.

131
00:05:56,595 --> 00:05:58,501
Well, there, there's
a $20 limit, right ? So.

132
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,500
Yeah, I wanted this party
to be really special.

133
00:06:00,548 --> 00:06:02,123
So I sorta went above and beyond.

134
00:06:02,216 --> 00:06:03,852
hat's great, well, don't
tell me who it is, 'cause...

135
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:05,870
It was Ryan ! Yep.

136
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:08,243
I  have Ryan.

137
00:06:08,318 --> 00:06:09,840
Gather 'round.

138
00:06:09,946 --> 00:06:12,681
Secret Santa, let's go.
Let's go. Come on.

139
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:14,441
Stanley, no. I'm gonna handle the cord.

140
00:06:14,705 --> 00:06:16,043
Kay ? Safety reasons.

141
00:06:16,117 --> 00:06:17,741
I know how to plug something in.

142
00:06:17,787 --> 00:06:18,891
I wanna do it.

143
00:06:19,008 --> 00:06:20,350
All right !

144
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:23,586
Let's count it down.
Like Rockefeller Center.

145
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:25,480
Ready ?

146
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:26,446
Three.

147
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:27,631
Two.

148
00:06:27,706 --> 00:06:28,712
One.

149
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:30,621
Yeah !

150
00:06:31,685 --> 00:06:33,202
Not great.

151
00:06:33,316 --> 00:06:34,922
Sorry, everybody.

152
00:06:35,908 --> 00:06:37,760
I think the tree looks nice.

153
00:06:38,426 --> 00:06:40,500
- I could get some flares from my car.
-  No, no

154
00:06:40,628 --> 00:06:43,442
Shake it off, everybody.
Just, let's do Secret Santa.

155
00:06:43,595 --> 00:06:47,021
Presents are the best way to show
someone how much you care.

156
00:06:48,096 --> 00:06:51,042
It is like this tangible thing
that you can point to and say:

157
00:06:51,118 --> 00:06:54,323
"Hey, man, I love you this
many dollars worth."

158
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:57,541
First present, Oscar.

159
00:07:00,935 --> 00:07:02,150
A shower radio, neat.

160
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:03,661
Oh, great. That was from me.

161
00:07:03,746 --> 00:07:05,592
hanks, Kelly. You know, I was
gonna get one of these.

162
00:07:05,685 --> 00:07:08,633
Okay, that's enough.
Let's keep it moving on. Jim.

163
00:07:09,527 --> 00:07:11,151
Ah, cool.

164
00:07:14,688 --> 00:07:16,041
That's from me.

165
00:07:16,315 --> 00:07:17,591
Great.

166
00:07:17,987 --> 00:07:19,372
Where'd you get it ?

167
00:07:19,495 --> 00:07:21,641
I don't know, it was so long ago.

168
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,030
He obviously forgot to get me something.

169
00:07:24,096 --> 00:07:27,190
And then he went into his closet
and dug out this little number.

170
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:28,772
And then threw it in a bag.

171
00:07:28,898 --> 00:07:30,952
Yep, that's exactly what happened.

172
00:07:31,045 --> 00:07:32,022
Pam.

173
00:07:39,887 --> 00:07:41,943
Oh, my God !

174
00:07:42,936 --> 00:07:46,142
Thank you very much, Santa.
Whoever you are.

175
00:07:46,626 --> 00:07:48,862
- It's awesome.
- There's a little more to it.

176
00:07:48,956 --> 00:07:50,972
All right, next. Ryan.

177
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,323
Don't !

178
00:07:57,636 --> 00:07:59,133
A video iPod.

179
00:08:01,928 --> 00:08:04,773
omebody really got carried away
with the spirit of Christmas.

180
00:08:05,498 --> 00:08:07,842
It was me. I got carried
away with the spirit.

181
00:08:07,927 --> 00:08:09,961
Wasn't there a $20 limit on the gift?

182
00:08:11,065 --> 00:08:12,832
This is 400 bucks.

183
00:08:13,215 --> 00:08:15,753
- You don't know that.
- Yeah, you left the price tag on.

184
00:08:15,867 --> 00:08:18,311
I did, what ? Oh, shoot. Wow,

185
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:21,402
Well, who cares?
It doesn't matter what I spent.

186
00:08:21,496 --> 00:08:24,290
What matters is that
Christmas is fun, right ?

187
00:08:25,987 --> 00:08:27,743
Michael.

188
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,532
For me ?

189
00:08:29,888 --> 00:08:33,311
What is in here ?

190
00:08:35,406 --> 00:08:37,682
- Come on.
-  I-I knitted it for you.

191
00:08:38,538 --> 00:08:40,532
An oven mitt ?

192
00:08:40,828 --> 00:08:42,280
Okay.

193
00:08:43,848 --> 00:08:45,230
So Phyllis is basically saying :

194
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,571
"Hey Michael, I know you did
a lot to help the office this year."

195
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,903
"But I only care about you...
a homemade oven mitt's worth."

196
00:08:51,547 --> 00:08:53,733
I gave Ryan an iPod.

197
00:08:56,776 --> 00:09:00,213
Should we just keep
opening up the presents ?

198
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:03,211
We don't do anything until Michael
gives us further instructions.

199
00:09:08,108 --> 00:09:09,082
I got it !

200
00:09:09,136 --> 00:09:14,510
We are going to turn Secret
Santa into Yankee Swap !

201
00:09:14,886 --> 00:09:16,360
What is, Yankee Swap ?

202
00:09:16,415 --> 00:09:18,560
One person chooses a gift.

203
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:21,352
The next person can
either choose a gift.

204
00:09:21,415 --> 00:09:23,843
Or steal that person's gift.

205
00:09:24,155 --> 00:09:27,622
If your gift gets stolen, then you
can steal someone else's gift

206
00:09:27,887 --> 00:09:29,083
Or choose a new gift.

207
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:31,191
I thought that was
called nasty Christmas.

208
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:33,063
Yeah, we call it White Elephant.

209
00:09:33,126 --> 00:09:34,562
Well, I call it fun !

210
00:09:34,738 --> 00:09:35,822
Why are we doing this ?

211
00:09:35,886 --> 00:09:37,863
Because it's better.
Because it's more special.

212
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,383
- I sounds mean.
- Shut...

213
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,162
No, it's not. Okay, just give it a shot.

214
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:44,992
Michael should have asked the
party planning committee first.

215
00:09:45,608 --> 00:09:48,322
He's not supposed to just spring
things on us out of nowhere.

216
00:09:54,308 --> 00:09:56,813
Okay, Meredith is up first.

217
00:09:57,016 --> 00:09:59,620
Here's the deal.
You can either pick a new gift,

218
00:09:59,756 --> 00:10:03,100
OR, you can steal somebody
else's gift they've already gotten.

219
00:10:03,257 --> 00:10:04,921
Like the oven mitt.

220
00:10:05,047 --> 00:10:06,250
I'll take the teapot.

221
00:10:06,325 --> 00:10:08,282
Oh, shouldn't we...

222
00:10:09,135 --> 00:10:10,631
I bought that specifically for Pam.

223
00:10:10,725 --> 00:10:12,801
Yaaankee Swap.
That's what makes it fun.

224
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,931
- Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now.
- I'll take the iPod.

225
00:10:16,347 --> 00:10:18,451
And I have to give it to her ?
I don't have a choice ?

226
00:10:18,526 --> 00:10:20,720
Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt,

227
00:10:20,778 --> 00:10:23,892
the old shirt, the shower
radio or pick a new gift.

228
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:38,122
- That was meant for Kelly.
- Yeah, I figured.

229
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,691
I think this is going great.

230
00:10:55,786 --> 00:10:59,340
- Yikes.
-  Well, it's for Angela, so...

231
00:11:02,506 --> 00:11:04,782
That's like the creepiest
thing that I've ever seen.

232
00:11:04,836 --> 00:11:06,932
Angela, you're up.

233
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:11,302
I'll take the poster.

234
00:11:14,098 --> 00:11:16,042
Some  people like these.

235
00:11:16,226 --> 00:11:18,581
I will steal the iPod.

236
00:11:19,155 --> 00:11:22,081
Everyone wants the iPod.
It's a huge hit.

237
00:11:22,347 --> 00:11:24,801
It is almost a Christmas miracle.

238
00:11:24,848 --> 00:11:28,320
Ah, well, Oscar, you little gourmand.

239
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:29,822
You have the next turn.

240
00:11:29,966 --> 00:11:33,372
I'll take the teapot.

241
00:11:33,588 --> 00:11:34,501
Dammit.

242
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:37,121
Okay, moving along,
Meredith, let's go.

243
00:11:37,377 --> 00:11:40,031
I really want the iPod.

244
00:11:40,176 --> 00:11:42,410
It's already been stolen this round.
Pick something else.

245
00:11:42,508 --> 00:11:45,972
I hope nobody takes this baby,
'cause this is great.

246
00:11:46,135 --> 00:11:48,802
Wow, look at that fine craftsmanship.

247
00:11:49,748 --> 00:11:52,542
Somebody really put a lot of
work into that. It's beautiful.

248
00:11:53,265 --> 00:11:55,603
I'll take the oven mitt.

249
00:11:59,346 --> 00:12:01,642
See, I wanted somebody to take it.
Boom.

250
00:12:01,937 --> 00:12:02,953
Reverse psychology.

251
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:05,993
Reverse psychology is an awesome tool.

252
00:12:06,098 --> 00:12:07,190
I don't know if you guys know about it.

253
00:12:07,246 --> 00:12:12,790
But, basically you make someone think
the opposite of what you believe.

254
00:12:12,986 --> 00:12:16,450
And that tricks them into
doing something stupid.

255
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:19,561
Works like a charm.

256
00:12:24,955 --> 00:12:27,641
In addition to these paint
ball pellets your gift includes,

257
00:12:27,766 --> 00:12:30,132
two paintball lessons
with Dwight Schrute.

258
00:12:30,175 --> 00:12:32,491
You and me, Michael. Yes !

259
00:12:36,487 --> 00:12:38,673
Who wants to take
paintball lessons ?

260
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,733
How is that better than an iPod ?

261
00:12:40,957 --> 00:12:43,331
I never said it was better than an iPod.

262
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:49,080
Michael keeps bragging about his iPod.
But, you know what ?

263
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,540
Two paintball lessons with
someone as experienced

264
00:12:51,648 --> 00:12:54,310
as I am is worth easily like two grand.

265
00:12:54,437 --> 00:12:56,691
Take that Saddam.

266
00:12:56,796 --> 00:12:58,521
Last gift, Kevin.

267
00:12:58,635 --> 00:13:00,820
I want the footbath.

268
00:13:03,377 --> 00:13:05,301
That's the thing I bought myself.

269
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:08,512
I'm really psyched to use it.

270
00:13:10,145 --> 00:13:13,071
Maybe I should have taken the iPod.

271
00:13:15,298 --> 00:13:16,912
Shoot.

272
00:13:17,016 --> 00:13:19,520
Pam, steal something
or pick the final gift.

273
00:13:19,835 --> 00:13:21,690
I want the iPod.

274
00:13:21,798 --> 00:13:24,480
- Dammit.
- Sure you don't want the teapot ?

275
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,932
I mean, it's an iPod.

276
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,023
- Right.
- Sorry.

277
00:13:28,085 --> 00:13:29,851
No, no, definitely.

278
00:13:29,988 --> 00:13:34,492
Okay, well, I guess I will take,
that book of short stories.

279
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:38,173
Yes! There you go.
I want the teapot.

280
00:13:38,268 --> 00:13:40,210
Gracias.

281
00:13:40,326 --> 00:13:41,731
You gotta be kidding me. 

282
00:13:41,847 --> 00:13:46,161
Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets..

283
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:50,033
Christmas.

284
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:53,030
What is she so upset about ?

285
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,892
Maybe because you hated
her present so much.

286
00:13:54,986 --> 00:13:57,133
I think Yankee Swap was a big hit.

287
00:13:57,285 --> 00:13:58,843
I think it was a success.

288
00:13:58,896 --> 00:14:01,260
And I'm the one who ended up with
Dwight's stupid paint ball pellets.

289
00:14:01,347 --> 00:14:04,792
Yeah, but Michael, the point is that
we all bought gifts for specific people.

290
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:07,712
And  you should have just bought
a $20 gift like everyone else.

291
00:14:07,785 --> 00:14:11,292
Well, I didn't! I got a big bonus
because I fired Devin,

292
00:14:11,397 --> 00:14:14,212
And I used the money to buy
something awesome. Sue me !

293
00:14:16,307 --> 00:14:18,101
You got a bonus check ?

294
00:14:18,307 --> 00:14:19,603
How much ?

295
00:14:19,895 --> 00:14:24,323
It wasn't...It wasn't that much.
It was 3,000.

296
00:14:24,437 --> 00:14:26,891
All right, I'm done now.

297
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:33,863
Unbelievable. I do the nicest thing that
anyone's ever done for these people.

298
00:14:33,905 --> 00:14:34,791
And they freak out.

299
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:38,493
Well, happy birthday, Jesus.
Sorry your party's so lame.

300
00:14:41,896 --> 00:14:43,751
That comes to 166.41.

301
00:14:43,937 --> 00:14:45,323
All right, now you're the expert.

302
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:48,212
Is this enough to get
20 people plastered ?

303
00:14:49,308 --> 00:14:51,561
Fifteen bottles of vodka?

304
00:14:51,936 --> 00:14:55,600
-Yeah, that should do it.
- Cool, cool. Box it up.

305
00:14:57,456 --> 00:15:02,112
<i>We wish you a Merry Christmas</i>
<i>We wish you a Merry Christmas</i>

306
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:05,593
<i>We wish you a Merry Christmas
And a Happy New Year</i>

307
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,663
I bought this teapot for Pam,
and I know she really wants it.

308
00:15:08,738 --> 00:15:10,582
- So can I trade you for it ?
- No trades.

309
00:15:10,697 --> 00:15:13,471
Come on. It's a shamrock keychain.
Good luck.

310
00:15:13,888 --> 00:15:15,772
A real man makes his own luck.

311
00:15:15,928 --> 00:15:17,501
Billy Zane, "Titanic".

312
00:15:17,518 --> 00:15:19,273
Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight.

313
00:15:19,606 --> 00:15:22,870
Can I buy it from you ?
- No, I want it. I'm going to use it.

314
00:15:22,948 --> 00:15:24,580
- You don't even drink tea.
- True.

315
00:15:24,697 --> 00:15:26,161
But I get sinus infections.

316
00:15:26,295 --> 00:15:29,983
And sinus infections can be cured by
making a tea, from green tea leaf stems.

317
00:15:30,058 --> 00:15:34,112
And pouring it directly
into your nose like so.

318
00:15:36,117 --> 00:15:39,752
To think that my gift to
Pam will be used for that...

319
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:42,781
It's a little too much to handle.

320
00:15:43,038 --> 00:15:44,573
- This is awesome.
- I know,

321
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,810
It's totally going to change
the way I workout.

322
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,292
Yeah, and I was going to get
you one of these for Christmas.

323
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,573
Now I don't have to.
I'm gonna save a ton of money.

324
00:15:51,665 --> 00:15:52,862
So what are you going
to get me instead ?

325
00:15:52,978 --> 00:15:56,371
I don't know.
Probably like a sweater or something.

326
00:15:59,956 --> 00:16:03,180
Looks like Santa was a little naughty.

327
00:16:04,885 --> 00:16:06,120
What is that ?

328
00:16:06,236 --> 00:16:10,151
This is Christmas spirit.
As in spirits. Booze.

329
00:16:10,648 --> 00:16:12,012
We can drink ?

330
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:14,051
We're really not supposed
to serve alcohol.

331
00:16:14,187 --> 00:16:17,333
Zip it! Toby.
Just, I mean, it's a party, come on.

332
00:16:17,668 --> 00:16:21,130
If I can't throw a good party for
my employees, then I am a terrible boss.

333
00:16:23,137 --> 00:16:24,633
- Who wants a drink ?
- Me, please.

334
00:16:24,768 --> 00:16:26,911
Here we go !

335
00:16:27,527 --> 00:16:29,563
The deal is that this is my last hurrah.

336
00:16:29,727 --> 00:16:33,513
Cause I made a New Year's resolution
that I'm not going to drink anymore.

337
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:35,541
During the week.

338
00:16:36,026 --> 00:16:37,353
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

339
00:16:37,537 --> 00:16:40,153
Does everyone know

340
00:16:40,246 --> 00:16:43,392

343
00:16:50,855 --> 00:16:52,593
What line of work you in, Bob ?

344
00:16:53,308 --> 00:16:56,151
I got, I lost Culpepper
at TO, it was over, man.

345
00:16:56,638 --> 00:17:01,032
Oh yeah, I need McNabb and Deon Branch
to have big games or else I'm done.

346
00:17:01,115 --> 00:17:04,303
It's possible. I can't believe you
traded Sean Alexander, man.

347
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:06,952
- I had to I need a defense.
- Come on! Sean Alexander ?

348
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:09,240
- He's the best back in the league !
- Defense.

349
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:12,062
- <i>Oh, no, it's-that's not worth it.
- It is worth it.</i>

350
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,080
- <i>Never.
- Are you kidding ? You wait.</i>

351
00:17:14,398 --> 00:17:18,622
Anybody making out in here ?
Not yet, give it time

352
00:17:18,877 --> 00:17:20,891
Oh hey, Ebenezer. Boink.

353
00:17:21,116 --> 00:17:23,170
Okay, how's it going in here ?

354
00:17:23,247 --> 00:17:25,343
We're running low on cups.
Do you want me to just run out and

355
00:17:25,376 --> 00:17:26,462
- Yeah, there should be some
- No, no, no.

356
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:28,212
We'll find some, don't leave the party.

357
00:17:28,286 --> 00:17:30,500
One, two, three !

358
00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:37,971
Kudos to Ryan, king 
of the party committee !

359
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,841
Oh, no, I REALLY did not do anything.

360
00:17:40,937 --> 00:17:43,173
No false modesty, my friend.

361
00:17:47,377 --> 00:17:49,541
You know, you don't have
to answer calls during a party.

362
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:51,912
- Just thought you should know.
- No.

363
00:17:51,978 --> 00:17:54,402
I was just, checking out my present.

364
00:17:58,138 --> 00:17:59,732
I traded with Dwight.

365
00:18:00,158 --> 00:18:04,652
I figured, you know, you went to a lot
of trouble and that means a lot.

366
00:18:06,566 --> 00:18:09,780
And  also Roy got me an iPod or,

367
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:13,362
was going to get me an iPod, so...

368
00:18:14,158 --> 00:18:19,282
Well, either way. This is an amazing
gift because it comes with bonus gifts.

369
00:18:20,425 --> 00:18:22,293
Look inside.

370
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,192
Oh my God !

371
00:18:29,606 --> 00:18:31,411
The yearbook picture !

372
00:18:31,548 --> 00:18:34,100
Yeah, I think I made the right choice.

373
00:18:34,736 --> 00:18:36,612
Oh, my God.

374
00:18:36,636 --> 00:18:38,590
This is incredible.

375
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:39,782
Is this the Boggle timer ?

376
00:18:39,857 --> 00:18:42,700
I didn't think you were going
to get that one. I really didn't know.

377
00:18:43,735 --> 00:18:46,082
This is so awesome.

378
00:18:46,228 --> 00:18:49,220
Not bad- and if it couldn't go to Ryan,
you are the guy I'd want it to go to.

379
00:18:49,746 --> 00:18:50,963
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

380
00:18:51,057 --> 00:18:52,443
Merry Christmas asswipe.

381
00:18:52,488 --> 00:18:55,541
No way! Oh, you're kidding me.
Packer !

382
00:18:57,245 --> 00:19:00,383
Yes! Todd Packer, ladies and gentlemen !

383
00:19:00,768 --> 00:19:02,563
What's up, my nerds ?

384
00:19:02,677 --> 00:19:04,523
- Check it out.
- Oh no, no.

385
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:05,883
Oh, look at that !

386
00:19:05,998 --> 00:19:07,790
Icing on the cake !

387
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,131
Pac man need a drinky.

388
00:19:10,265 --> 00:19:12,500
Let's fix you up.
Who wants to fix up- Toby?

389
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,143
Toby's gonna fix you up.

390
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:15,910
- Whoo!
- Yeah.

391
00:19:20,355 --> 00:19:21,633
Darryl !

392
00:19:21,766 --> 00:19:23,730
Here you go. You earned it.

393
00:19:23,805 --> 00:19:25,381
- That's okay Mike.
- No no no no no

394
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,523
I really want you to have it.

395
00:19:27,807 --> 00:19:29,673
All right, thanks, man.

396
00:19:29,787 --> 00:19:32,041
Hey, Merry Christmas.

397
00:19:33,718 --> 00:19:35,542
Whose butt is that ?

398
00:19:35,897 --> 00:19:36,781
Mine.

399
00:19:37,357 --> 00:19:39,151
How did I not guess that ?

400
00:19:39,305 --> 00:19:41,041
Lampshade on the head !

401
00:19:41,328 --> 00:19:43,662
It's happening !

402
00:19:43,988 --> 00:19:45,453
Ho, no !

403
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,081
Hey.

404
00:19:55,268 --> 00:19:57,273
Hello there.

405
00:19:58,548 --> 00:20:01,403
- What are you doing ?
- I don't know.

406
00:20:02,045 --> 00:20:05,122
You shouldn't do things like that.
The man is supposed to do that.

407
00:20:18,705 --> 00:20:20,333
Thanks for the party Michael.

408
00:20:20,468 --> 00:20:22,562
Listen up, we're going
to Poor Richard's.

409
00:20:22,935 --> 00:20:24,103
- Who's in?
- I'm in.

410
00:20:24,218 --> 00:20:25,730
- Yes !
- Michael ?

411
00:20:26,885 --> 00:20:28,551
Poor Richard's ?

412
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,250
Yeah, that sounds good.

413
00:20:30,398 --> 00:20:32,543
Christmas is awesome.

414
00:20:32,655 --> 00:20:34,132
First of all...

415
00:20:34,285 --> 00:20:36,431
You get to spend time
with people you love.

416
00:20:36,566 --> 00:20:37,712
Secondly...

417
00:20:37,805 --> 00:20:40,023
You can get drunk and
no one can say anything.

418
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:43,790
Third, you give presents.
What's better than giving presents?

419
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:45,880
And fourth, getting presents.

420
00:20:45,918 --> 00:20:48,122
So four things.
Not bad for one day.

421
00:20:48,286 --> 00:20:51,170
It's really the greatest day of all time.

422
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:56,532
Hey Meredith, heading
over to Poor Richard's ?

423
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:57,502
Yep.

424
00:20:57,555 --> 00:20:59,002
Cool, cool, cool.

425
00:20:59,136 --> 00:21:01,280
You need a ride ?

426
00:21:10,586 --> 00:21:12,620
All right, let's head out.

427
00:21:13,198 --> 00:21:15,670
Sounds good, do you have a coat ?

428
00:21:15,905 --> 00:21:18,241
- Yeah.
- Oooh-kay.

00:00:02,254 --> 00:00:03,493
if you see it back to back...

3
00:00:04,835 --> 00:00:05,944
Dunder Mifflin this is Pam.

4
00:00:05,954 --> 00:00:08,536
<i>Pam, it's Michael. Help me,
I need help right now !</i>

5
00:00:08,702 --> 00:00:11,389
- Michael, what's wrong ?
- <i>I'm hurt, I have hurt myself.</i>

6
00:00:11,822 --> 00:00:13,937
- <i>Oh my God ! </i>
- Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait !

7
00:00:13,986 --> 00:00:15,698
<i>This is not looking good Pam !</i>

8
00:00:15,743 --> 00:00:17,863
Michael, do you need me
to call you an ambulance ?

9
00:00:17,908 --> 00:00:19,110
<i>No, I want you to pick me up.</i>

10
00:00:19,126 --> 00:00:20,280
- Okay.
- What's going on ?

11
00:00:20,303 --> 00:00:21,944
I thought you said
that you were hurt.

12
00:00:21,971 --> 00:00:24,701
- <i>I am hurt. I hurt my foot.</i>
- I'm sorry ? Pam, what's going on ?

13
00:00:24,748 --> 00:00:27,427
<i>I want to come to work...
...but I need you to come pick me up.</i>

14
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:30,691
- <i>Ohh, God !</i>
- Hey, whoa ! Michael !

15
00:00:30,775 --> 00:00:32,983
- <i>Oh, God !</i>
- It's okay. It's Jim.

16
00:00:33,195 --> 00:00:35,701
Just say again, really loudly,
uh, what happened.

17
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:38,051
<i>Okay, Buhh !
I burned my foot.</i>

18
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:40,632
<i>Very badly on my Foreman grill</i>

19
00:00:40,677 --> 00:00:43,371
<i>and I now need someone to come
and bring me into work.<i>

20
00:00:43,405 --> 00:00:46,523
You burned YOUR foot
on a Foreman grill ?

21
00:00:46,905 --> 00:00:48,632
I enjoy having breakfast in bed.

22
00:00:48,906 --> 00:00:51,320
I like waking up with
the smell of bacon. Sue me.

23
00:00:51,505 --> 00:00:54,330
And since I don't have a butler,
I have to do it myself.

24
00:00:54,438 --> 00:00:56,982
So, most nights before I go to bed,

25
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,470
I will lay six strips of bacon out
on my George Foreman grill.

26
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:02,470
Then I go to sleep.

27
00:01:02,587 --> 00:01:04,833
When I wake up, I plug in the grill.

28
00:01:05,137 --> 00:01:06,610
I go back to sleep again.

29
00:01:06,897 --> 00:01:10,773
Then I wake up to the smell
of crackling bacon.

30
00:01:11,346 --> 00:01:13,062
It is delicious, it's good for me.

31
00:01:13,155 --> 00:01:14,991
It's a perfect way to start the day.

32
00:01:15,388 --> 00:01:18,382
Today I got up,
I stepped onto the grill

33
00:01:18,407 --> 00:01:20,162
and it clamped down
on my foot, that's it.

34
00:01:20,237 --> 00:01:22,642
I don't see what's so hard
to believe about that.

35
00:01:23,136 --> 00:01:24,561
<i>Pam, could you come get me ?</i>

36
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:27,393
Uh, I have to stay here
and answer the phone.

37
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:29,833
Okay, could someone come
and get me, please ? Ryan ?

38
00:01:29,976 --> 00:01:31,650
Michael, you should stay home and rest.

39
00:01:31,687 --> 00:01:33,503
<i>There's no toilet paper here.
Could Ryan...</i>

40
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:35,072
<i>Tell Ryan to bring toilet paper !</i>

41
00:01:35,225 --> 00:01:36,341
<i>Could you tell him that ?</i>

42
00:01:36,477 --> 00:01:37,462
Can you hop ?

43
00:01:37,535 --> 00:01:39,042
<i>I tried hopping Kevin,</i>

44
00:01:39,077 --> 00:01:41,630
<i>and I bumped my elbow
against the wall,</i>

45
00:01:41,947 --> 00:01:44,922
<i>and now my elbow
has a "protruberence".</i>

46
00:01:47,015 --> 00:01:48,513
<i>No one wants to pick me up ?!<i>

47
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:51,640
What is going on ?

48
00:01:52,836 --> 00:01:53,923
What is going on ?

49
00:01:54,107 --> 00:01:55,581
Michael is, um, sick.

50
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:57,212
And he wants one of us
to rescue him.

51
00:01:57,245 --> 00:01:59,210
- <i>I'm not sick, I'm...<i>
- I'm coming, Michael !

52
00:01:59,246 --> 00:02:01,510
- I'm going to save you !
- <i>Don't ! Is that Dwight ?</i>

53
00:02:01,566 --> 00:02:04,122
- <i>I do not want Dwight.</i>
- Hold on Michael, I am coming !

54
00:02:04,177 --> 00:02:05,891
- Wait there !
- <i>I do not want Dwight !</i>

55
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:08,451
Michael, why don't you call
your girlfriend ?

56
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:09,632
<i>I don't have a girlfriend.</i>

57
00:02:09,828 --> 00:02:11,833
But you said you went out
with her this weekend.

58
00:02:11,876 --> 00:02:13,791
<i>It was all made up.
Just, someone come, okay ?</i>

59
00:02:13,846 --> 00:02:15,370
<i>Anyone. Anyone but Dwight.</i>

60
00:02:17,336 --> 00:02:18,940
- What was that ?
- What WAS that ?

61
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:24,603
He hit the pole.

62
00:02:27,185 --> 00:02:29,220
- It's broken, right ? He can't...
- Oh my gosh.

63
00:02:33,338 --> 00:02:34,952
- Oh my God.
- Oh my Gosh.

64
00:02:35,296 --> 00:02:36,172
Is he okay ?

65
00:02:36,935 --> 00:02:37,871
He's still driving.

66
00:02:39,207 --> 00:02:42,052
Dwight... you forgot your bumper !

67
00:02:43,015 --> 00:02:44,083
<i>Hello ?</i>

68
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:45,862
<i>Please don't send Dwight.</i>

00:02:45,945 --> 00:02:48,793

00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:24,222
Morning everyone.

73
00:03:25,577 --> 00:03:26,292
Don't freak out.

74
00:03:26,786 --> 00:03:28,361
I forbid anybody to freak out.

75
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:31,520
Clearly I have had a very
serious accident.

76
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:33,012
But  I will recover.

77
00:03:33,308 --> 00:03:34,443
God willing.

78
00:03:34,717 --> 00:03:36,653
I just wanna be treated
normally today.

79
00:03:36,688 --> 00:03:38,313
Normal would actually be good.

80
00:03:38,515 --> 00:03:40,472
Considering the trauma
that I've been through.

81
00:03:40,496 --> 00:03:43,112
You missed two big conference
calls today. One with corporate.

82
00:03:43,146 --> 00:03:44,750
Did you explain why ?

83
00:03:45,386 --> 00:03:47,770
No, I didn't mention that
you cooked your foot.

84
00:03:47,837 --> 00:03:49,070
Burned my foot, Pam.

85
00:03:50,947 --> 00:03:52,780
Please stop popping my cast.

86
00:03:53,935 --> 00:03:54,741
Thank you.

87
00:03:56,616 --> 00:03:58,181
So where are you
shipping your foot ?

88
00:03:59,317 --> 00:04:00,690
So where are you shipping...

89
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:03,761
Your foot.

90
00:04:05,805 --> 00:04:06,980
Thank you.

91
00:04:08,357 --> 00:04:09,831
Pam, messages please.

92
00:04:10,107 --> 00:04:12,250
- You didn't have any.
- Really ?

93
00:04:12,547 --> 00:04:15,980
Well, seemed, uh, very important
to you earlier,

94
00:04:16,438 --> 00:04:18,023
that you needed to stay and..

95
00:04:18,207 --> 00:04:19,711
- Do my job ?
- No.

96
00:04:19,936 --> 00:04:21,951
Your job is being my friend, Pam...

97
00:04:22,065 --> 00:04:23,090
and...

98
00:04:23,185 --> 00:04:24,742
- God !
- It slipped.

99
00:04:25,435 --> 00:04:26,632
- What did...
- Sorry.

100
00:04:26,698 --> 00:04:27,661
It's just that before,

101
00:04:27,707 --> 00:04:29,701
you said you didn't want
any special treatment.

102
00:04:29,755 --> 00:04:31,651
I don't want any special
treatment, Pam.

103
00:04:31,735 --> 00:04:34,301
just want you to treat me
like you would

104
00:04:34,648 --> 00:04:38,681
a family member who's undergone
some sort of serious physical trauma.

105
00:04:38,806 --> 00:04:40,313
I don't think that's too much to ask.

106
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:42,792
Do you want some aspirin ?
Because you seem a little fussy.

107
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,853
No, I don't want some aspirin.
Yeah, I am fussy.

108
00:04:44,895 --> 00:04:46,430
Asiprin's not gonna do
a damn thing.

109
00:04:46,457 --> 00:04:48,973
I'm sitting here with a bloody
stump of a foot.

110
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:51,431
Pam, I am Assistant Regional Manager.

111
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:53,043
And I can take care of him.

112
00:04:53,647 --> 00:04:55,480
Part of my duties are to...

113
00:05:02,597 --> 00:05:03,642
What ?

114
00:05:03,915 --> 00:05:06,403
- Part of your duties are to what ?
- What ?

115
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:09,181
You just said part of your duties
are to something.

116
00:05:09,215 --> 00:05:10,693
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

117
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:13,402
- What is wrong with you ?
- What is wrong with you ?

118
00:05:27,345 --> 00:05:29,362
- Where is my cornbread ?
- Here you go.

119
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,120
Thank you. Did you get all
dark meat like I like ?

120
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,482
Yes, I ordered three full rotisserie
chickens worth of all dark meat.

121
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:36,630
Where are the yams ?

122
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:39,170
They were out of yams.
I got you creamed spinach.

123
00:05:39,237 --> 00:05:40,831
Did you go to the one
in Stroudsburg ?

124
00:05:41,486 --> 00:05:43,380
- And they had no yams ? 
- They had no yams.

125
00:05:43,407 --> 00:05:45,330
How strange.
Because they always have yams.

126
00:05:47,267 --> 00:05:49,963
Oh, man, is that
a Prism Duro Sport ?

127
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:52,073
You've seen one of these ?

128
00:05:52,126 --> 00:05:54,881
Yeah, they're like an iPod,
only they're better.

129
00:05:55,028 --> 00:05:56,751
'Cause they're chunkier
and more solid.

130
00:05:57,485 --> 00:05:58,913
Roy gave it to me for Christmas.

131
00:05:58,957 --> 00:06:00,961
I'm trying to figure out
how to put songs on it.

132
00:06:00,988 --> 00:06:02,492
Oh, no, no, no. Don't go there.

133
00:06:03,505 --> 00:06:04,852
I know this Russian website,

134
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,403
where  you can download songs
for two cents a piece.

135
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,873
- Really ?
- Yeah,

136
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,582
I'll write down the address for you.

137
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:13,081
Only, the only thing is...

138
00:06:13,316 --> 00:06:14,640
is that all the songs,

139
00:06:14,877 --> 00:06:15,861
are in Russian.

140
00:06:18,556 --> 00:06:19,702
Kidding !

141
00:06:23,237 --> 00:06:24,812
Why would they all be...

142
00:06:27,825 --> 00:06:29,470
Okay, see you later, Pan.

143
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:35,490
Pam ?

144
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,984
Pam ? Pam !

145
00:06:41,191 --> 00:06:42,421
Oh, God.

146
00:06:45,188 --> 00:06:46,187
What ?

147
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:47,562
<i>Come here, please.</i>

148
00:06:47,597 --> 00:06:49,072
Tell me before I come there.

149
00:06:50,456 --> 00:06:52,201
<i>I want you to rub butter
on my foot.</i>

150
00:06:52,265 --> 00:06:53,812
- No.
- <i>Pam, please.</i>

151
00:06:54,277 --> 00:06:55,942
- <i>I have Country Crock.</i>
- No.

152
00:07:01,907 --> 00:07:03,161
Ryan !

153
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,061
Ryan !

154
00:07:06,188 --> 00:07:07,431
Ryan !

155
00:07:07,807 --> 00:07:09,193
These covers...

156
00:07:09,257 --> 00:07:11,373
are totally indestructable.

157
00:07:11,437 --> 00:07:12,342
- Really ?
- Yeah.

158
00:07:12,577 --> 00:07:14,133
Throw it. I promise it won't break.

159
00:07:14,975 --> 00:07:15,531
Chuck it.

160
00:07:21,288 --> 00:07:23,312
- Oh, no, it's broken.
- What ?

161
00:07:23,866 --> 00:07:25,560
No, it's fine.

162
00:07:25,705 --> 00:07:28,291
I told you it wouldn't break.
You could throw it all day long.

163
00:07:28,326 --> 00:07:29,521
That is so cool.

164
00:07:30,425 --> 00:07:32,212
- Thanks Dwight.
- You're welcome.

165
00:07:35,225 --> 00:07:37,380
So, I guess Pam and Dwight
are friends now.

166
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:41,003
Oh, God, no.
Dwight isn't my friend.

167
00:07:43,148 --> 00:07:45,291
Oh my God...
Dwight's kind of my friend.

168
00:07:46,356 --> 00:07:49,831
No, no, no one is helping me out
at all, Mom.

169
00:07:51,776 --> 00:07:53,453
No, I'm not gonna call Jan.

170
00:07:53,686 --> 00:07:54,920
She'd just worry.

171
00:07:55,048 --> 00:07:56,980
Drive down here and
make a big thing.

172
00:07:59,306 --> 00:08:00,312
Who told you that ?

173
00:08:01,396 --> 00:08:03,113
No, it was mutual.

174
00:08:04,698 --> 00:08:06,653
What is Pam doing chatting
with you ?

175
00:08:14,137 --> 00:08:15,503
Do you like candy ?

176
00:08:16,436 --> 00:08:17,493
It's alright.

177
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,771
'Cause you're sweeter than candy.

178
00:08:20,848 --> 00:08:22,111
What is wrong with you ?

179
00:08:24,678 --> 00:08:25,751
Hey, cut...

180
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,442
Wow, you just dive right in.

181
00:08:56,295 --> 00:08:57,472
You know, around age 12,

182
00:08:57,528 --> 00:08:59,280
I just started going for it,
you know ?

183
00:09:03,347 --> 00:09:04,361
<i>Oh, help !</i>

184
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:05,970
<i>Help me !</i>

185
00:09:06,335 --> 00:09:07,622
What happened ?

186
00:09:07,698 --> 00:09:08,972
<i>I fell of the toilet.</i>

187
00:09:10,285 --> 00:09:12,503
<i>I'm caught between the toilet
and the wall.</i>

188
00:09:14,177 --> 00:09:16,072
- What do you need ?
- <i>Not you.</i>

189
00:09:16,655 --> 00:09:18,230
<i>Someone  else. Get Pam.</i>

190
00:09:18,277 --> 00:09:20,752
I don't think Pam's gonna want to
come into the men's room.

191
00:09:20,786 --> 00:09:23,080
<i>Get Ryan.
He needs to lift me.</i>

192
00:09:23,735 --> 00:09:25,632
<i>And he needs to 
clean me up a little bit.</i>

193
00:09:25,655 --> 00:09:27,123
<i>Bring a wet towel.</i>

194
00:09:27,656 --> 00:09:30,161
Ryan is, uh...

195
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:31,661
- dead.
- <i>No he's not.</i>

196
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:32,861
- Dead.
- <i>I just saw him.</i>

197
00:09:34,376 --> 00:09:36,270
He's...
can you just get up yourself ?

198
00:09:36,397 --> 00:09:38,603
I... you only grilled your foot.

199
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:39,843
Oh, forget it.

200
00:09:40,397 --> 00:09:41,940
I'll just get up myself.

201
00:09:48,066 --> 00:09:49,401
<i>Ow, God !</i>

202
00:09:51,588 --> 00:09:53,782
Do you think Dwight's being 
a little weird today ?

203
00:09:53,868 --> 00:09:54,880
No...

204
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:57,101
He's actually been really
nice and helpful.

205
00:09:57,696 --> 00:09:59,263
And that isn't weird ?

206
00:10:01,156 --> 00:10:01,973
Well...

207
00:10:03,747 --> 00:10:05,802
Can I have everyone's attention,
please ?

208
00:10:06,117 --> 00:10:07,283
Phyllis...

209
00:10:07,437 --> 00:10:08,501
Oscar...

210
00:10:08,717 --> 00:10:10,612
Ryan, who is supposed to be dead.

211
00:10:11,536 --> 00:10:13,282
Can  I ask you all a question ?

212
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:16,230
Do you know what it's like
to be disabled ?

213
00:10:16,467 --> 00:10:17,490
Oscar  ?

214
00:10:17,768 --> 00:10:19,592
I had scoliosis as a girl.

215
00:10:19,705 --> 00:10:20,983
Never heard of it. No...

216
00:10:21,018 --> 00:10:23,412
a real disability.
Not a woman's trouble.

217
00:10:23,788 --> 00:10:26,552
When I was a teenager,
I was in an iron lung.

218
00:10:26,635 --> 00:10:28,202
What... how old are you ?

219
00:10:28,706 --> 00:10:30,073
No, it... Look,

220
00:10:30,886 --> 00:10:32,260
the point is...

221
00:10:32,447 --> 00:10:37,002
I am the only one here who has
a legitimate disability.

222
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:41,700
Although I'm sure Stanley has had
his fair share of obstacles.

223
00:10:42,197 --> 00:10:45,003
I'm not disabled,
and neither are you.

224
00:10:45,087 --> 00:10:46,083
Okay.

225
00:10:46,118 --> 00:10:48,461
What does this look like
to you, Stanley ?

226
00:10:49,655 --> 00:10:51,203
Mail Boxes, Etc.

227
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:52,392
Shut...it.

228
00:10:53,315 --> 00:10:55,231
Okay. Well...

229
00:10:56,068 --> 00:10:57,271
Well, you know what ?

230
00:10:57,398 --> 00:11:01,031
Disabilities are not things
to be laughed at,

231
00:11:01,557 --> 00:11:02,990
or laughed about.

232
00:11:03,405 --> 00:11:05,051
You people are jerks.

233
00:11:05,127 --> 00:11:07,892
Imagine if you had left
Stevie Wonder

234
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:10,182
on the floor of that bathroom
instead of me.

235
00:11:10,268 --> 00:11:12,542
Oh, we wouldn't.
We love Stevie Wonder.

236
00:11:15,986 --> 00:11:17,542
I burned my foot !

237
00:11:18,936 --> 00:11:21,591
Okay, 20 minutes, conference room.

238
00:11:21,676 --> 00:11:23,173
Everybody's in there !

239
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:26,031
Dad ?

240
00:11:31,586 --> 00:11:34,412
While we are waiting for
our special guest to arrive,

241
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,143
I wanted you all to take a look
at a few of the many,

242
00:11:37,207 --> 00:11:40,992
many disabled icons who have
contributed so much to our society.

243
00:11:41,485 --> 00:11:42,743
- Quick question.
- Yeah ?

244
00:11:42,888 --> 00:11:45,483
- Why is Tom Hanks on the wall ?
- Twice.

245
00:11:45,796 --> 00:11:47,032
Good question.

246
00:11:47,177 --> 00:11:49,281
Forrest Gump, mentally challenged.

247
00:11:49,846 --> 00:11:51,593
Philadelphia... AIDS.

248
00:11:51,907 --> 00:11:53,551
I think that's from Big.

249
00:11:54,378 --> 00:11:56,570
I don't think so, no.

250
00:11:56,696 --> 00:11:59,220
Yeah, he's dancing on a piano
with Robert Loggia.

251
00:11:59,258 --> 00:12:00,711
He grew into a man overnight.

252
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:02,913
A rare disability. It still works.

253
00:12:05,198 --> 00:12:06,722
A crossword puzzle Stanley ?

254
00:12:06,756 --> 00:12:09,010
Seriously, are you learning
nothing here ?

255
00:12:10,305 --> 00:12:11,812
What do you mean, "Mm-hmm" ?

256
00:12:11,887 --> 00:12:14,000
- I mean I'm learning nothing.
- Okay.

257
00:12:14,107 --> 00:12:16,010
Michael Scott.
I'm looking for Michael Scott.

258
00:12:16,057 --> 00:12:17,810
Yes, right in here.

259
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:19,221
- Good.
- Come on in..

260
00:12:19,257 --> 00:12:20,272
Great.

261
00:12:20,325 --> 00:12:21,770
This ladies and gentlemen,

262
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:23,472
is our special guest.

263
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:27,653
Sorry I'm late. Somebody parked
in the handicapped parking space.

264
00:12:29,937 --> 00:12:32,060
Hey, everyone.
I'm Billy Merchant.

265
00:12:32,155 --> 00:12:33,940
You may have seen me
around here before.

266
00:12:34,007 --> 00:12:36,691
I'm the properties manager
of this office park.

267
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,981
You are so brave.

268
00:12:38,455 --> 00:12:39,560
You are so brave.

269
00:12:39,665 --> 00:12:41,270
Thank you.
Actually, I've been meaning

270
00:12:41,297 --> 00:12:42,643
to come by here or a long time...

271
00:12:42,668 --> 00:12:45,461
But it's hard for you, right ?
Because you're in a wheelchair.

272
00:12:46,177 --> 00:12:48,111
No, I just have a lot of properties
to manage.

273
00:12:48,155 --> 00:12:49,671
Let me ask you something.

274
00:12:49,698 --> 00:12:52,113
How long does it take you to do
something simple ?

275
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:54,910
Everyday, like...
like brush your teeth in the morning.

276
00:12:55,045 --> 00:12:56,843
I don't know, like, 30 seconds.

277
00:12:56,886 --> 00:12:58,111
Oh, my God.

278
00:12:58,246 --> 00:13:00,443
That's three times as long as
it takes me.

279
00:13:01,506 --> 00:13:03,731
How did you,
get in your wheelchair ?

280
00:13:03,925 --> 00:13:05,102
This morning ?

281
00:13:05,145 --> 00:13:07,273
Just like every other morning.
Just climbed on in.

282
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:10,392
Hey, hey, hey, hey !
Not funny, not funny !

283
00:13:10,468 --> 00:13:12,960
Hey, hey, relax just, uh..
joking around here.

284
00:13:13,445 --> 00:13:15,833
Well, that's good.
He still has a sense of humor.

285
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:19,151
Listen, I've actually used a chair
since I was four years old.

286
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,590
- I don't really notice it anymore.
- Well, they do.

287
00:13:21,646 --> 00:13:23,451
They notice it. Don't you ?
You notice it.

288
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:26,613
It's the first thing you saw when
he rolled in here, isn't it ?

289
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:29,891
I wanna clamp Michael's face
in a George Foreman grill.

290
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:33,031
So there are jsut a couple things
I wanted to remind everybody of.

291
00:13:33,076 --> 00:13:34,500
- Okay.
- First is parking.

292
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:37,000
You can't block the freight
entrance with your car,

293
00:13:37,048 --> 00:13:40,010
even if your blinkers are on.
Does anybody have any questions ?

294
00:13:41,058 --> 00:13:42,240
Yes ?

295
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:44,901
Yeah ?

296
00:13:45,588 --> 00:13:46,782
Yes ?

297
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,520
Dwight, you have your hand up.

298
00:13:52,587 --> 00:13:53,540
Ignore him.

299
00:13:54,105 --> 00:13:55,161
You know what ?

300
00:13:55,767 --> 00:13:57,523
We're not that different,
you and I.

301
00:13:57,635 --> 00:14:01,183
When I clamped my foot
into a non-stick...

302
00:14:01,218 --> 00:14:02,713
- You know what, Michael ?
- Yeah ?

303
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,671
- Let me stop you right there...
- Okay.

304
00:14:04,697 --> 00:14:05,743
and leave.

305
00:14:05,818 --> 00:14:08,193
Did you see
"Born on the 4th of July" ?

306
00:14:08,818 --> 00:14:11,803
I was under the impression that
Billy would be more like that guy.

307
00:14:11,886 --> 00:14:13,432
What's wrong with that guy ?

308
00:14:13,495 --> 00:14:15,740
You mean today ?
He stepped on a George Forman grill

309
00:14:15,775 --> 00:14:16,982
and he burned his foot.

310
00:14:17,037 --> 00:14:18,113
No, not Michael.

311
00:14:18,215 --> 00:14:20,771
The moon-faced kid who crashed
into the pole.

312
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:25,130
He looks like he has a concussion.

313
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:30,761
Hey !

314
00:14:30,918 --> 00:14:33,392
I found the pudding cups
you wanted at a gas station

315
00:14:33,438 --> 00:14:34,530
in Carbondale !

316
00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:36,760
You did it.
Look at you !

317
00:14:36,817 --> 00:14:38,900
And with the plate and the napkin.

318
00:14:38,955 --> 00:14:40,501
Very nice. Thank you, Ryan.

319
00:14:40,685 --> 00:14:42,700
- You're very welcome.
- Did you get the yams ?

320
00:14:42,755 --> 00:14:46,100
No, the gas station in Carbondale
did not have fresh yams.

321
00:14:47,157 --> 00:14:49,431
Okay.
I'll just have the pudding.

322
00:14:49,507 --> 00:14:50,562
- You sure ?
- Yeah.

323
00:14:50,748 --> 00:14:51,713
Okay.

324
00:14:51,735 --> 00:14:53,382
You know what ?
I feel better.

325
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:55,942
Ryan brought me some
chocolate pudding

326
00:14:55,986 --> 00:14:58,080
and his kindness healed my foot.

327
00:14:59,596 --> 00:15:03,162
Yeah, baby !
I am feelin' better.

328
00:15:03,197 --> 00:15:05,122
My body's literally healing itself.

329
00:15:05,617 --> 00:15:07,283
It is amazing what the human body

330
00:15:07,315 --> 00:15:09,532
is capable of when you have
a powerful brain.

331
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:12,342
I ground up four
extra strength aspirins

332
00:15:12,398 --> 00:15:13,972
and put them in Michael's pudding.

333
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:16,070
I do the same thing for my dog

334
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:18,092
to get him to take his
heartworm medicine.

335
00:15:19,077 --> 00:15:23,000
Ohh, finally feel the blood coursing
through my foot veins.

336
00:15:26,295 --> 00:15:29,073
Okay, I think we need to take him
to the hospital, because...

337
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:30,881
I'm pretty sure he has
a concussion.

338
00:15:30,956 --> 00:15:33,280
Oh, now you feel some
compassion for him.

339
00:15:33,337 --> 00:15:35,832
He needs to go right now.
And you're his emergency contact.

340
00:15:35,857 --> 00:15:38,480
- I think you should go with him.
- Why don't you go with him ?

341
00:15:38,508 --> 00:15:40,611
- I barely know him.
- I want Michael to take me.

342
00:15:40,675 --> 00:15:42,302
I can't take you.
I don't have my car.

343
00:15:42,346 --> 00:15:43,901
- Please ?
- And yours is all vomity.

344
00:15:43,938 --> 00:15:45,921
- You can take my van !
- Oh, okay.

345
00:15:45,966 --> 00:15:48,772
That's great. No, I can't drive.
Jim, why don't you drive ?

346
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:50,161
- Fine.
- We'll go.

347
00:15:50,186 --> 00:15:51,951
I'm still recovering.
So let's just...

348
00:15:52,008 --> 00:15:53,390
Ryan, can you get my coat please ?

349
00:15:53,437 --> 00:15:55,972
Slowly. 'Kay ?
Let's just get to the elevator.

350
00:15:56,358 --> 00:15:58,132
- What are you doing ?
- Vietnam sounds.

351
00:15:58,177 --> 00:15:59,931
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

352
00:16:00,757 --> 00:16:03,111
- Tired. Can't lay down.
- Just take a rake...

353
00:16:03,388 --> 00:16:04,451
Wake up !

354
00:16:04,557 --> 00:16:05,980
Wait, here, let me help you Dwight.

355
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,241
- Come on. Get up.
- Thanks.

356
00:16:07,286 --> 00:16:08,821
- Get up.
- You're the best.

357
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:11,090
- Just keep him awake.
- It smells like chicken soup.

358
00:16:11,126 --> 00:16:12,963
- I know.
- I have to go to the hospital.

359
00:16:13,008 --> 00:16:15,092
- I know.
- Where are we going ?

360
00:16:15,138 --> 00:16:17,733
- I just wanna say good-bye, okay ?
- I'll be back, I mean...

361
00:16:17,775 --> 00:16:19,511
Yes, I know.
But it's gonna be different.

362
00:16:19,535 --> 00:16:20,570
Why ?

363
00:16:20,628 --> 00:16:22,082
It's just hard to explain.

364
00:16:22,186 --> 00:16:24,031
Oh, Pam, you're adorable.

365
00:16:24,088 --> 00:16:26,131
Oh, my goodness.

366
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:29,370
- Come here.
- Ohh. Huggy hugs.

367
00:16:30,508 --> 00:16:31,550
Shotgun !

368
00:16:31,838 --> 00:16:34,432
You don't think you should sit
in the back with Dwight ?

369
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,730
The rules of shotgun are
very simple and very clear.

370
00:16:37,755 --> 00:16:39,713
The first person to shout shotgun

371
00:16:40,106 --> 00:16:43,091
when you're within the sight
of the car gets the front seat.

372
00:16:43,357 --> 00:16:45,132
That's how the game's played.

373
00:16:45,358 --> 00:16:47,782
There are no exceptions for someone
with a concussion.

374
00:16:47,837 --> 00:16:49,203
Oh, God, a minivan.

375
00:16:50,287 --> 00:16:52,142
What is Meredith's problem ?

376
00:16:52,675 --> 00:16:54,003
Well, I think she has a kid.

377
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:55,642
Yeah, she has one kid
and no husband.

378
00:16:55,685 --> 00:16:57,962
She's not going to find one
driving this thing around.

379
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,853
- Where are we going ? 
- Come on.

380
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,071
- Get inside.
- Where are we going ?

381
00:17:02,156 --> 00:17:04,521
- We're going to Chuck E. Cheese.
- Chuck E. Cheese ?

382
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:06,323
Oh, God. I'm so sick of
Chuck E. Cheese.

383
00:17:07,017 --> 00:17:08,631
We're going to the hospital,
Michael.

384
00:17:08,687 --> 00:17:10,342
I know. I'm just sayin'...

385
00:17:12,855 --> 00:17:15,450
- Dwight, what are you drinking ?
- I found it under the seat.

386
00:17:15,485 --> 00:17:16,313
Oh, my God. Dwight.

387
00:17:16,587 --> 00:17:18,013
-  I'm thirsty.
- Put that down.

388
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:20,111
Give the bottle to Michael.

389
00:17:20,168 --> 00:17:21,812
- I'm thirsty.
- Just give it to me...

390
00:17:21,856 --> 00:17:24,702
Just keep your eyes on the road.
Give me the bottle or you're fired.

391
00:17:24,747 --> 00:17:26,662
You can't fire me,
I don't work in this van !

392
00:17:26,705 --> 00:17:28,240
- Give it to me, Dwight !
- No, stop.

393
00:17:28,277 --> 00:17:29,941
- Give me the bottle !
- Will you stop ?

394
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,992
- Give me the bottle, Dwight !
- Michael, stop !

395
00:17:32,006 --> 00:17:33,432
- Just give it !
- Michael, stop !

396
00:17:33,457 --> 00:17:35,663
- Just stop it !
- Stop spraying ! Gimmme the bottle.

397
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:37,053
- Stop !
- Stop spraying me !

398
00:17:37,378 --> 00:17:38,400
Gimme the bottle !

399
00:17:38,678 --> 00:17:40,922
Dwight, what is your middle name ?

400
00:17:41,177 --> 00:17:42,443
Danger.

401
00:17:43,237 --> 00:17:44,521
Something with a "K."

402
00:17:44,575 --> 00:17:45,640
It's Kurt.

403
00:17:45,907 --> 00:17:48,003
Wow, I'm so sad that I know that.

404
00:17:48,258 --> 00:17:50,802
What do I write under
reason for visit ?

405
00:17:51,548 --> 00:17:52,542
Concussion.

406
00:17:55,485 --> 00:17:56,583
What did you write ?

407
00:17:56,995 --> 00:17:58,433
Nothing.

408
00:17:59,456 --> 00:18:01,533
I wrote
"bringing someone to the hospital."

409
00:18:01,885 --> 00:18:04,613
So you thought they meant your
reason for coming to the hospital.

410
00:18:04,656 --> 00:18:07,141
You know what, Jim ?
This isn't about me anymore.

411
00:18:07,846 --> 00:18:09,312
I made a miraculous recovery,

412
00:18:09,357 --> 00:18:11,161
which is more than
I can say for him.

413
00:18:11,346 --> 00:18:12,460
Come on, Dwight.

414
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:16,313
- Hi, Michael.
- Hi, Dwight.

415
00:18:20,446 --> 00:18:24,353
Doctor, what is more serious,
a head injury or a foot injury ?

416
00:18:24,386 --> 00:18:25,390
A head injury.

417
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,211
Well, you don't have
all the information.

418
00:18:27,248 --> 00:18:28,722
The foot had been severly burned,

419
00:18:28,785 --> 00:18:30,491
and, uh, healed quickly.

420
00:18:30,537 --> 00:18:31,690
Very quickly.

421
00:18:31,785 --> 00:18:34,152
Actually,
like suspiciously quickly.

422
00:18:34,226 --> 00:18:35,533
So I'm ordering a CAT scan.

423
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:37,262
What is that ?

424
00:18:37,355 --> 00:18:39,831
Look, since you have the machine
up and running,

425
00:18:39,897 --> 00:18:42,133
can I just stick my foot in ?
We can take a look....

426
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,591
Well...for a burn,

427
00:18:43,617 --> 00:18:45,963
you really just need to look
at the outside of the foot.

428
00:18:46,016 --> 00:18:47,710
Okay, what kind of
machine is that ?

429
00:18:47,778 --> 00:18:49,760
Does the skin look red
and swollen ?

430
00:18:49,817 --> 00:18:50,991
That's what she said.

431
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:53,351
That's my joke. Damn it, Dwight.

432
00:18:55,855 --> 00:18:58,101
Okay, no electronics past this point.

433
00:18:58,206 --> 00:19:00,542
- Camera, sound equipment.
- It's okay, they're with me.

434
00:19:00,577 --> 00:19:02,403
No metal of any kind.

435
00:19:02,586 --> 00:19:04,962
All right, well, I guess this is
where we leave you off.

436
00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:06,531
I don't wanna do this.

437
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,170
Well, you should have
thought of that

438
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:10,833
before you crashed your head
on your way to pick me up, so...

439
00:19:10,925 --> 00:19:13,692
we'll see you when you get out.

440
00:19:19,008 --> 00:19:20,561
Fine, fine.

441
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:37,801
- Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
- Dunder Mifflin, this is Jim.

442
00:19:37,946 --> 00:19:40,450
Oh, my God, what's going on ?
Is Dwight okay ?

443
00:19:40,565 --> 00:19:42,393
<i>He should be fine.
But they brought him in</i>

444
00:19:42,427 --> 00:19:43,433
<i>for a CAT scan.</i>

445
00:19:43,497 --> 00:19:45,302
I can't believe he's getting
a CAT scan.

446
00:19:45,348 --> 00:19:47,092
<i>Michael went in there with him too.</i>

447
00:19:47,147 --> 00:19:48,492
<i>- It's pretty sweet.
- Really ?</i>

448
00:19:48,857 --> 00:19:50,180
<i>Michael went in with him ?</i>

449
00:19:51,017 --> 00:19:52,642
<i>But they shouldn't be
much longer now.<i>

450
00:19:52,665 --> 00:19:53,671
<i>So we'll be back soon.</i>

451
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,363
Okay, that's...
...good news.

452
00:19:56,316 --> 00:19:58,510
- Uh, yeah, no. I'll let you go.
<i>- Okay.</i>

453
00:19:58,665 --> 00:19:59,320
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Bye.

454
00:19:59,355 --> 00:20:00,300
<i>Bye.</i>

455
00:20:08,047 --> 00:20:09,860
- Hey, Oscar ?
- What's up Pam ?

456
00:20:10,156 --> 00:20:13,352
I just wanted to let you know
that Dwight's gonna be okay.

457
00:20:13,507 --> 00:20:16,303
The doctor said there's a really
simple treatment for a concussion,

458
00:20:16,357 --> 00:20:18,430
so he'll probably even be back
at work tomorrow.

459
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:19,520
Okay.

460
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:22,020
I just, uh, thought you'd
wanna know that.

461
00:20:27,355 --> 00:20:30,201
Okay, Mr. Schrute, inhale
with me on three.

462
00:20:30,575 --> 00:20:31,580
One,

463
00:20:31,687 --> 00:20:32,451
two...

464
00:20:32,596 --> 00:20:33,510
Sir,

465
00:20:33,617 --> 00:20:35,150
Sir, stop that. Stop...

466
00:20:36,267 --> 00:20:36,900
Stop that.

1
00:00:00,444 --> 00:00:03,197
So, I'm happy to be here.

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:05,232
It's very nice to see all of you.

3
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:07,068
You're all looking well.

4
00:00:07,223 --> 00:00:08,980
Today's a Women in the Workplace thing.

5
00:00:09,725 --> 00:00:12,568
Jan's coming in from corporate,
to talk to all the women about...

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,507
I don't really know what.

7
00:00:16,704 --> 00:00:18,003
But, Michael's not allowed in.

8
00:00:18,494 --> 00:00:20,055
She said that about five times.

9
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:23,482
Women today, though we
have the same options as men,

10
00:00:24,015 --> 00:00:27,250
we often face a very
different set of obstacles...

11
00:00:27,393 --> 00:00:28,906
In getting there, so...

12
00:00:29,249 --> 00:00:30,920
- Hey, what's going on ?
- Michael, I...

13
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:32,276
Yeah, you know what ? I just...

14
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:34,821
I just have a few things I wanna say.

15
00:00:35,746 --> 00:00:37,770
- What are you doing ?
- Just hear me out.

16
00:00:38,657 --> 00:00:40,703
What is more important than quality ?

17
00:00:40,978 --> 00:00:41,972
Equality.

18
00:00:42,035 --> 00:00:44,602
Now, studies show that today's woman,

19
00:00:44,658 --> 00:00:47,810
the Ally McBeal woman,
as I call her, is at a crossroads.

20
00:00:48,055 --> 00:00:49,971
- Michael...
- And, no, just...

21
00:00:50,196 --> 00:00:51,940
You have come a long way, baby.

22
00:00:52,065 --> 00:00:54,703
But, I just wanna keep it within reason.

23
00:00:54,848 --> 00:00:57,002
- They did this up in Albany.
- You are not allowed,

24
00:00:57,046 --> 00:00:58,530
- in this session.
- And they...

25
00:00:58,656 --> 00:01:00,411
Into a lactation room,
which is disgusting.

26
00:01:00,497 --> 00:01:02,441
Now you're really not
allowed in this session.

27
00:01:02,545 --> 00:01:04,791
- I'm their boss, so I feel like...
- I'm your boss.

28
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,342
- Anybody want any coffee ?
- We're fine, Michael.

29
00:01:12,418 --> 00:01:13,742
We just need you to leave please.

30
00:01:13,797 --> 00:01:15,291
<i>Women in the Workplace.</i>

31
00:01:15,847 --> 00:01:19,550
Yeah, translation, I have been banned
from my own conference room.

32
00:01:19,615 --> 00:01:21,581
So that Jan can talk in
secret to all the girls.

33
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:24,033
Oh, sorry, "Women of the Workplace."

34
00:01:24,147 --> 00:01:25,321
About what ? I don't know.

35
00:01:25,465 --> 00:01:27,561
Clothes, me...

36
00:01:29,525 --> 00:01:32,182
Ladies, I am so, so sorry.

37
00:01:32,398 --> 00:01:34,230
Can we... start again ?

38
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:36,342
- We were on such a roll. I really,
- Jan.

39
00:01:36,437 --> 00:01:38,331
- apologize for that.
- Yes, Pam.

40
00:01:38,596 --> 00:01:40,461
- Michael's still at the door.
- Michael!

45
00:02:12,945 --> 00:02:14,723
<i>So, one obstacle is</i>

46
00:02:14,857 --> 00:02:17,691
<i>how assertiveness is perceived
differently in men and women.</i>

47
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,961
<i>Men, who are assertive
tend to be admired.</i>

48
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,993
<i>They're called...anyone ?</i>

49
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:25,613
That's a terrible idea.

50
00:02:26,186 --> 00:02:27,290
What is ?

51
00:02:27,415 --> 00:02:29,072
Them, in there all together.

52
00:02:29,346 --> 00:02:32,563
They stay in there too long, they're
gonna get on the same cycle.

53
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,532
Wreak havoc on our plumbing.

54
00:02:37,207 --> 00:02:38,421
Everyone, guys.

55
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,141
Circle up, please.

56
00:02:40,467 --> 00:02:42,103
Come on over. Bring your chairs.

57
00:02:42,175 --> 00:02:43,913
Toby, come on over.

58
00:02:44,678 --> 00:02:47,022
You're a guy... too. Sort of.

59
00:02:47,815 --> 00:02:49,412
Let's do this.

60
00:02:49,488 --> 00:02:51,541
<i>Well, first of all, I,</i>

61
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:53,841
<i>just wanna warm up a little bit.
Let's just clap.</i>

62
00:02:53,945 --> 00:02:55,061
Let's just clap, ready ?

63
00:02:58,488 --> 00:02:59,712
That's what I'm talking about!

64
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:01,630
I don't know what you're
doing here, Michael.

65
00:03:01,676 --> 00:03:04,142
Just having a little "Guys in the
Workplace" kind of thing.

66
00:03:04,496 --> 00:03:07,703
Why can't boys play with dolls ?

67
00:03:08,365 --> 00:03:10,611
Why does society,

68
00:03:10,798 --> 00:03:14,323
force us to use urinals when sitting
down is far more comfortable ?

69
00:03:14,425 --> 00:03:16,513
Can you please do this
somewhere else, Michael ?

70
00:03:16,605 --> 00:03:19,083
We have no where else, Jan. This...

71
00:03:19,688 --> 00:03:21,052
We could do it in the warehouse.

72
00:03:21,178 --> 00:03:23,042
Dwigt. Excellent idea.
Go to the warehouse.

73
00:03:23,187 --> 00:03:24,583
Fine. Actually... Perfect.

74
00:03:24,725 --> 00:03:26,393
Perfect!  You know what ?

75
00:03:26,518 --> 00:03:29,520
There is another side to
this place, gentlemen.

76
00:03:29,757 --> 00:03:33,543
And I know we all love our cushy
jobs and our fun, exciting office.

77
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:36,953
But do you realize that underneath us,
there is another world.

78
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:38,613
The warehouse world.

79
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:43,663
A world that is teeming with sweat,
and dirt and life.

80
00:03:44,635 --> 00:03:45,661
Life.

81
00:03:46,045 --> 00:03:47,743
The bowels of the office.

82
00:03:47,868 --> 00:03:51,862
<i>These guys are down there.
They are real men doing real man's work.<i>

83
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,160
<i>We are going to learn
how a warehouse works.</i>

84
00:03:58,056 --> 00:03:59,960
I think this is gonna work out great.

85
00:04:00,127 --> 00:04:03,823
Because managing the warehouse
is a very important part of my job.

86
00:04:03,908 --> 00:04:06,270
And I haven't been there in months.

87
00:04:29,597 --> 00:04:32,732
Remember on "Lost",
when they met the Others ?

88
00:04:35,326 --> 00:04:37,903
I'm so sorry about that.

89
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:41,290
So where are we ?
Pam, are you okay taking notes then ?

90
00:04:42,217 --> 00:04:44,401
Please ? Thank you very much.

91
00:04:44,596 --> 00:04:46,241
So let's meet the warehouse !

92
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:48,663
Let's get some shots.

93
00:04:48,836 --> 00:04:50,942
Pan around there.

94
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:53,990
This is Darryl, one of our
warehouse staff.

95
00:04:54,235 --> 00:04:58,160
- Darryl, what is your biggest fear ?
- My biggest fear is that  someone will

96
00:04:58,246 --> 00:05:00,561
distract us from getting
all the shipments out on time.

97
00:05:00,687 --> 00:05:04,201
Darryl is actually the foreman
here, and not Roy. Which is cool.

98
00:05:04,677 --> 00:05:06,660
There's Roy, ridin' the big rig!

99
00:05:07,068 --> 00:05:10,882
so Roy is actually going to be
marrying Pam sometime this summer.

100
00:05:11,225 --> 00:05:14,753
And, uh, she's our receptionist.
Sort of a BrAngelina thing.

101
00:05:15,147 --> 00:05:16,120
Why ?

102
00:05:16,395 --> 00:05:19,603
BrAngelina is the Brad
Pitt and Angelina.

103
00:05:19,806 --> 00:05:22,542
- I don't understand.
- Roy, Roy and Pam. It's a Ram.

104
00:05:22,848 --> 00:05:24,143
It's a Ram thing.

105
00:05:24,297 --> 00:05:27,353
I bet Roy heard about you liking Pam.

106
00:05:27,966 --> 00:05:30,361
I bet he'll try to beat you up.

107
00:05:30,608 --> 00:05:32,482
Thanks for the heads-up, Kev.

108
00:05:32,626 --> 00:05:34,500
I got your back if he does.

109
00:05:38,145 --> 00:05:39,433
But try to stay out of it.

110
00:05:40,656 --> 00:05:43,052
Just  in case there's somebody down
here who shouldn't be.

111
00:05:43,178 --> 00:05:45,501
A little "Good Will Hunting" situation.

112
00:05:45,597 --> 00:05:47,093
All right, troops.

113
00:05:47,268 --> 00:05:50,770
This is an important day.
A big day.

114
00:05:50,887 --> 00:05:55,543
Now, you may look around
and see two groups here.

115
00:05:56,915 --> 00:05:58,230
White-collar, blue-collar.

116
00:05:58,355 --> 00:06:01,241
But I don't see it that way.
And you know why not ?

117
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:04,163
Because I am collar-blind.

118
00:06:05,778 --> 00:06:07,710
Why don't we go around
the table and all say

119
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,461
something that we know we're good at.

120
00:06:09,548 --> 00:06:12,261
I will start. I am good
at public speaking.

121
00:06:13,198 --> 00:06:16,841
Hi, I'm Meredith, and I'm an al
Good at supplier relations.

122
00:06:17,287 --> 00:06:18,611
Great. Phyllis.

123
00:06:19,398 --> 00:06:23,411
I'm good at computer stuff.
E-mails, spreadsheets, all that.

124
00:06:23,655 --> 00:06:25,123
Really ?

125
00:06:25,245 --> 00:06:27,961
- I don't know. I thought that...
- No, okay, stop.

126
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:31,211
You know, I've seen some of your 
spreadsheets. And I almost always...

127
00:06:31,296 --> 00:06:33,620
<i>I don't know how I fit
in with these women.</i>

128
00:06:34,397 --> 00:06:35,341
Here.

129
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,080
Or with Jan.

130
00:06:37,748 --> 00:06:40,191
I mean, we get along great. Fine.

131
00:06:41,827 --> 00:06:45,253
I guess the person I have the
most in common with is.

132
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,243
Jim.

133
00:06:47,686 --> 00:06:49,102
Halpert.

134
00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:52,872
Heard there's a rumor
going around about, you know

135
00:06:53,098 --> 00:06:54,972
you used to have a crush on Pam and...

136
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:56,802
-  Oh, no, no, no.
- No, no. It's cool.

137
00:06:56,905 --> 00:06:59,340
'Cause I know you're a good guy,
and I know that that crush

138
00:06:59,495 --> 00:07:03,012
ended a long time ago,
so, you know. We're cool, right ?

139
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:06,243
Yeah. No, yeah, definitely.

140
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:08,393
You know, it's great with
me, 'cause that way...

141
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:11,223
I'm glad she has a friend at work
she can get through the day with.

142
00:07:11,268 --> 00:07:14,030
That way she's not all, "Bah, bah,"
you know, when she gets home.

143
00:07:14,085 --> 00:07:17,340
- I like talking to her too.
- So, we're cool, right ?

144
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,096
- Yes, yeah.
- Good. All right.

145
00:07:20,179 --> 00:07:22,450
- Cool, man.
- Sweet.

146
00:07:29,636 --> 00:07:31,986
Hey, Mike, look. How about
we go upstairs, too ?

147
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:34,223
- Learn how an office works.
- Oh, well...

148
00:07:34,337 --> 00:07:36,071
We can both switch places for the day.

149
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:39,343
Yeah, you know what ? I don't, you're...

150
00:07:39,495 --> 00:07:40,931
My job sucks compared to this.

151
00:07:41,005 --> 00:07:42,992
I don't think you'd like it up there.
Guys !

152
00:07:43,118 --> 00:07:45,550
You wanna start unloading the truck ?

153
00:07:46,696 --> 00:07:48,352
Okay, let's go.

154
00:07:48,865 --> 00:07:49,923
Step up.

155
00:07:50,056 --> 00:07:52,510
Check this out. Look at that.

156
00:07:52,665 --> 00:07:53,932
Look at that.

157
00:07:54,227 --> 00:07:56,671
"Hello, how are"...
O-kay.

158
00:07:59,848 --> 00:08:00,892
That's great.

159
00:08:00,957 --> 00:08:02,910
That is good stuff.

160
00:08:03,157 --> 00:08:06,352
In five years, I'd like to be,
five years sober.

161
00:08:07,275 --> 00:08:09,030
That is an excellent goal.

162
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,543
Four and a half.

163
00:08:10,915 --> 00:08:13,721
I'll tell you one thing. I am not
going to be one of those women

164
00:08:13,847 --> 00:08:15,773
schlepping her kids around in a minivan.

165
00:08:16,016 --> 00:08:17,403
Great.

166
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:20,031
I want an SUV with three rows of seats.

167
00:08:21,688 --> 00:08:24,330
Well, I'll be honest. One of the
goals of these women seminars

168
00:08:24,435 --> 00:08:27,222
is to feel out if there's any standouts.
Women who could be valuable

169
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,551
addition to our corporate life.

170
00:08:33,148 --> 00:08:34,631
Michael wants us to bond.

171
00:08:34,758 --> 00:08:36,830
So we need topics for conversation.

172
00:08:36,978 --> 00:08:38,950
- Ponies.
-  No.

173
00:08:39,077 --> 00:08:40,443
How about rainbows ?

174
00:08:40,565 --> 00:08:42,510
- No.
- Flowers.

175
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:44,012
<i>- No.
- Make-up.</i>

176
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:45,782
Hey. You're gonna hurt yourself.

177
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:48,073
- Stand clear.
- Mike, get off of the lift, please.

178
00:08:48,176 --> 00:08:50,242
- I'm fine, I'm fine. I m' fine
- Come on, now.

179
00:08:50,938 --> 00:08:53,572
Would you...look. Michael.

180
00:08:59,568 --> 00:09:01,050
We'll get somebody
to clean that up.

181
00:09:01,148 --> 00:09:03,590
We're da ones that gotta clean that up !

182
00:09:03,866 --> 00:09:05,690
Damn it, Michael !

183
00:09:05,976 --> 00:09:07,752
We have to have this thing serviced.

184
00:09:07,977 --> 00:09:10,191
So, guys gripe session.

185
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:11,512
Here we are.

186
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:15,352
Now, we definitely live
in different worlds,

187
00:09:15,747 --> 00:09:17,473
but we have a lot in common.

188
00:09:17,846 --> 00:09:20,750
We even like the same girls, some of us.

189
00:09:21,355 --> 00:09:22,653
And that's gonna happen.

190
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,802
You know, we're guys. So...

191
00:09:24,986 --> 00:09:26,822
Hey... do you want me to go ?

192
00:09:27,685 --> 00:09:30,193
No... why would I... you could.

193
00:09:30,638 --> 00:09:32,932
- I'll go.
- Stay, or...

194
00:09:33,717 --> 00:09:36,031
And a big, walk-in closet.

195
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,782
- That's part of my dream too.
- Oh, me too.

196
00:09:38,935 --> 00:09:40,452
Great. Great.

197
00:09:41,258 --> 00:09:44,173
And, Pam, what about you ?
What is your dream ?

198
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:45,442
Well,

199
00:09:46,006 --> 00:09:49,010
I always dreamed of a
house with a terrace upstairs.

200
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,090
Plant flowers on it, stuff like that.

201
00:09:51,518 --> 00:09:53,463
Since I was a girl.

202
00:09:54,905 --> 00:09:57,862
More seriously, though,
a husband that I love.

203
00:09:58,816 --> 00:09:59,902
Roy.

204
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,911
And... I love to draw.

205
00:10:03,616 --> 00:10:06,420
And I, I did a little in college.
And I'd still love to do something,

206
00:10:06,528 --> 00:10:08,970
where I could work with art
or graphic design in some way.

207
00:10:09,096 --> 00:10:10,120
She's real good.

208
00:10:10,198 --> 00:10:14,912
You know, the company is offering
a design training program in New York.

209
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:17,921
I have a job right now.
So I can't really take time off.

210
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:20,812
It's, it's only on weekends.
And then a few weeks in New York

211
00:10:20,896 --> 00:10:24,071
But I'm sure that I could ask
corporate to help you out.

212
00:10:24,155 --> 00:10:26,251
It's just that the weekends
aren't good because...

213
00:10:26,388 --> 00:10:29,552
There's always a million
reasons not to do something.

214
00:10:33,307 --> 00:10:35,073
Let's start with the warehouse.

215
00:10:35,206 --> 00:10:37,003
What bothers you as guys ?

216
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:39,291
- You know ?
- My priority is safety.

217
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:39,743
Okay.

218
00:10:39,896 --> 00:10:43,183
So it really bothers me when somebody
comes in here speeding around on a lift,

219
00:10:43,307 --> 00:10:46,481
playing with it like a toy.
It kind of gets under my skin, okay ?

220
00:10:47,976 --> 00:10:49,590
- Don't-don't shush me.
- No, I...

221
00:10:49,698 --> 00:10:51,342
- That was just
- That bothers me too.

222
00:10:51,435 --> 00:10:54,231
- Pam shushes me, it drives me crazy.
- I hate shushing, you know ?

223
00:10:54,307 --> 00:10:59,343
That's the thing. What, okay.
What is our... beef as human men.

224
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,553
You know, that's a good
question, Hasselhoff.

225
00:11:04,546 --> 00:11:06,522
- Okay. All right.
- What bugs us ?

226
00:11:06,595 --> 00:11:08,602
Good. Guys raggin' on each other.

227
00:11:08,856 --> 00:11:11,692
That's what guys do.
And we love it.

228
00:11:11,877 --> 00:11:15,272
ll right, let's talk about... clothing.

229
00:11:16,138 --> 00:11:19,263
I'm excited about today.
I love girl talk.

230
00:11:19,987 --> 00:11:22,910
Dress for the job you want,
not the job you have.

231
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,080
You can use your clothing to send
a message about your ambitions

232
00:11:26,217 --> 00:11:29,963
by wearing clothes that reflect
what you aspire to be.

233
00:11:30,038 --> 00:11:32,061
<i>I'm not gaining anything
from this seminar.</i>

234
00:11:32,198 --> 00:11:35,222
I'm  a professional woman.
The head of accounting.

235
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,010
I'm in the healthiest
relationship of my life.

236
00:11:38,216 --> 00:11:41,262
I just think it's insulting that
Jan thinks we need this.

237
00:11:41,497 --> 00:11:45,032
And apparently...
judging from her outfit...

238
00:11:45,188 --> 00:11:47,951
Jan aspires to be a whore.

239
00:11:48,468 --> 00:11:50,880
I hate it when girls insist
on taking them out

240
00:11:50,956 --> 00:11:54,062
to new restaurants every weekend
night, and then they're like,

241
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:56,011
"When are we gonna go
on a date date ?"

242
00:11:56,498 --> 00:11:57,950
Exactly !

243
00:11:58,075 --> 00:11:59,192
That's so hard.

244
00:11:59,457 --> 00:12:02,303
Yeah, and then they make you drive
'em to church the next morning.

245
00:12:02,406 --> 00:12:04,432
Like, gas ain't free !

246
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,462
Yeah, on our salaries, man,
what do they expect, you know ?

247
00:12:08,508 --> 00:12:10,922
What, "take us out every weekend" ?
You know what I mean ?

248
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:13,202
- We're not millionaires. No you don't.
- I feel you.

249
00:12:13,256 --> 00:12:15,730
You don't feel us. How can you ?
You-you know what ?

250
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,632
- Not literally.
- You say we're the same,

251
00:12:17,718 --> 00:12:19,873
but we get compensated 
very differently.

252
00:12:19,915 --> 00:12:21,581
- Yes.
- We work the same hours as you,

253
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,252
And you just said we work a lot harder.

254
00:12:23,337 --> 00:12:26,670
- Uh, you do, so...
- But we get paid a lot less.

255
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,741
- Word.
- Like, next to no benefits.

256
00:12:28,895 --> 00:12:30,843
I know. God, what is that ?!

257
00:12:30,915 --> 00:12:32,972
- Exactly!
- It blows, it blows, man!

258
00:12:33,047 --> 00:12:35,583
You know, this would not
happen if we had a union.

259
00:12:35,715 --> 00:12:37,683
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Yeah, no.

260
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:40,051
- Absolutely, that's what we need.
- Man, see.

261
00:12:40,197 --> 00:12:41,680
That's what I been sayin', man.

262
00:12:41,815 --> 00:12:43,191
We need to do this finally.

263
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:46,953
Is that necessary ? 'Cause you already
sort of have a union of guys.

264
00:12:47,206 --> 00:12:49,950
It's more than necessary,
Mike. We need this

265
00:12:50,098 --> 00:12:53,020
Roy, you still have that card
from the dock workers union ?

266
00:12:53,097 --> 00:12:55,793
- In my truck.
-  Man, hook him up. Come on, man !

267
00:12:56,406 --> 00:12:59,580
Yeah. You know what, I think the
problem is the chicks.

268
00:12:59,817 --> 00:13:01,892
- Union, yeah !
- The problem is the chicks.

269
00:13:02,075 --> 00:13:04,611
And you gotta blame them.

270
00:13:05,746 --> 00:13:07,871
Are you with us, Mike ?

271
00:13:08,695 --> 00:13:10,313
Welcome to the warehouse.

272
00:13:14,948 --> 00:13:18,620
Another issue is inequality of
pay between men and women.

273
00:13:18,947 --> 00:13:21,461
I'm sure that all of you have
delt with that before.

274
00:13:21,685 --> 00:13:23,920
This is important.
Ladies, take a breather.

275
00:13:24,756 --> 00:13:28,823
Jan... I, wanted...

276
00:13:29,057 --> 00:13:30,952
Can I help you ?

277
00:13:32,677 --> 00:13:37,001
I wanted to say that the guys downstairs
are thinking about forming a union.

278
00:13:37,076 --> 00:13:39,553
- What ? A union. I'm not.
- And they have some good points.

279
00:13:39,606 --> 00:13:42,430
Part of my job is knowing
how to talk to women.

280
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:45,540
Let's... be... rational... here.

281
00:13:46,335 --> 00:13:47,903
What are the pros, what are the cons ? 

282
00:13:47,945 --> 00:13:50,680
The cons are that everyone will
lose their job, Micheal. Everyone.

283
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:53,063
Office, warehouse.

284
00:13:53,228 --> 00:13:56,993
What do you think the...
pros... are... here ?

285
00:13:57,178 --> 00:13:59,892
Don't talk to me that way,
please. Just...

286
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,403
They're gonna wanna
hear this from you.

287
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,140
You got yourself into
this, Michael, so

288
00:14:04,575 --> 00:14:06,960
- Well, we're bonding down there.
- It's too bad.

289
00:14:07,037 --> 00:14:10,233
I just don't wanna have to tell them
something they're not gonna wanna hear !

290
00:14:10,337 --> 00:14:12,190
Come  on, Jan.
After all we've been through.

291
00:14:12,287 --> 00:14:13,951
- Michael, Michael.
- We have a history.

292
00:14:14,077 --> 00:14:16,101
- Michael.
- We have a history. Between us.

293
00:14:16,176 --> 00:14:21,313
Don't say another word.
Get... yourself...downstairs.

294
00:14:21,807 --> 00:14:24,791
I'm just saying that we have
something... okay, whatever.

295
00:14:26,745 --> 00:14:28,253
You know what ?

296
00:14:28,426 --> 00:14:31,593
We could get this done a lot quicker
if we formed a type of assembly line.

297
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:35,412
This here is a
run-out-the-clock situation.

298
00:14:35,598 --> 00:14:37,640
Just like upstairs.

299
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:41,200
Sports metaphors are one
of the ways women feel left out

300
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:44,002
of the language of the office.
Now, I know this might sound silly,

301
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:47,121
but many women ask to go over it.
So... fumble means...

302
00:14:47,188 --> 00:14:48,672
- <i>Mistake.</i>
- Slip.

303
00:14:48,768 --> 00:14:49,560
Right.

304
00:14:49,717 --> 00:14:53,292
Par for the course is a golf term,
it means right on track.

305
00:14:54,267 --> 00:14:58,933
Below par means worse.
Wait. That's doesn't make sense.

306
00:14:59,006 --> 00:15:00,623
What about second base ?

307
00:15:00,688 --> 00:15:04,012
Like if Michael said
he got to second base with you ?

308
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,701
- Does that mean he closed the deal ?
- Excuse me ?

309
00:15:06,878 --> 00:15:09,902
- I mean, that's a baseball term, right ?
- I don't know what.

310
00:15:09,988 --> 00:15:13,192
Michael was... talking about

311
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,080
- Hey.
- Hey!

312
00:15:23,496 --> 00:15:24,731
How's it going down there ?

313
00:15:24,826 --> 00:15:28,312
It's a complete. Well, actually it's
exactly what you'd expect, so...

314
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,290
- How are the girls ?
- Good.

315
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:32,863
We watched a video
about our changing bodies.

316
00:15:33,088 --> 00:15:35,532
- Did you really ?
-  No.

317
00:15:35,677 --> 00:15:36,852
Almost.

318
00:15:39,328 --> 00:15:42,510
Something kind of cool. There's this
internship in graphic design

319
00:15:42,626 --> 00:15:46,651
that Jan was telling us about.
She made it sound, like, really great.

320
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:48,952
Nice. Well, what's it all about ?

321
00:15:49,055 --> 00:15:51,831
I think you should do it.
That's great!

322
00:15:52,757 --> 00:15:54,192
It's really cool.

323
00:15:54,337 --> 00:15:57,753
Cold front comin' in to the warehouse !

324
00:15:59,295 --> 00:16:01,242
Better put on your ski boots !

325
00:16:05,828 --> 00:16:08,132
Happy New Year Darryl !

326
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,621
Hey, Darryl!

327
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:14,453
You ever done this ?

328
00:16:16,548 --> 00:16:17,782
Are you married ?

329
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:20,600
- I'm divorced.
- That must have been hard.

330
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:21,822
It was. Yes.

331
00:16:21,845 --> 00:16:24,312
You were probably feeling
really depressed and sad.

332
00:16:24,496 --> 00:16:26,803
And that's why you did
that thing with Michael.

333
00:16:26,836 --> 00:16:29,650
I think you should all spend a little
more time about your careers

334
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,701
and less time on personal stuff.

335
00:16:31,785 --> 00:16:34,130
I think we're all okay with
the balance we've struck.

336
00:16:34,265 --> 00:16:36,781
At least you don't have kids.
You have no kids, right ?

337
00:16:36,935 --> 00:16:38,063
- Thank God.
-  Okay

338
00:16:38,195 --> 00:16:40,603
Let's take five.
I think we could all use five.

339
00:16:42,838 --> 00:16:45,731
How can someone so beautiful be so sad ?

340
00:16:48,935 --> 00:16:50,943
- Hi.
- Did you take care of the situation ?

341
00:16:51,105 --> 00:16:52,933
Yeah, yeah. Yes.

342
00:16:53,257 --> 00:16:55,623
- I... I have... essentially
- Excuse me.

343
00:16:55,957 --> 00:16:57,473
- Yes, I've taken...
- Excuse me.

344
00:16:57,488 --> 00:17:00,283
I'm told that there's been some
interest in forming a union.

345
00:17:00,388 --> 00:17:01,912
And that Michael supported it.

346
00:17:02,028 --> 00:17:03,533
Obviously he's not a friend of yours,

347
00:17:03,635 --> 00:17:06,171
because he didn't tell you the facts
So let me.

348
00:17:06,306 --> 00:17:09,051
If there is even a whiff of
unionizing in this branch,

349
00:17:09,136 --> 00:17:11,882
I can guarantee you the branch
will be shut down like that.

350
00:17:12,035 --> 00:17:15,083
They unionized in Pittsfield, and we
all know what happened in Pittsfield.

351
00:17:15,215 --> 00:17:17,721
It will cost each of you
a fortune in legal fees.

352
00:17:17,817 --> 00:17:20,932
Union dues, and that'll be nothing
compared to the cost of losing your jobs.

353
00:17:20,997 --> 00:17:24,761
So I would think long and hard
before sacrificing your savings

354
00:17:24,818 --> 00:17:27,490
and your futures just to send a message.

355
00:17:27,998 --> 00:17:30,900
If you have any further questions,
you can direct them to...

356
00:17:32,795 --> 00:17:34,231
to Michael.

357
00:17:37,365 --> 00:17:38,901
<i>Dreams are just that.</i>

358
00:17:39,056 --> 00:17:41,942
<i>They're dreams. 
They help get you through the day.</i>

359
00:17:42,376 --> 00:17:44,742
<i>Like the thing about
the terrace. It's nice.</i>

360
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,183
But, um...

361
00:17:46,545 --> 00:17:49,591
I don't know. It was just something
I read in this book when I was 12.

362
00:17:49,905 --> 00:17:53,963
The girl in the book has a
terrace outside of her bedroom...

363
00:17:54,105 --> 00:17:57,620
<i>And she planted flowers on it.
And I just loved that.</i>

364
00:17:58,057 --> 00:18:00,243
<i>Just always kind of stuck with me.</i>

365
00:18:00,336 --> 00:18:02,601
So, you're not doing it.

366
00:18:04,086 --> 00:18:06,032
How  did you know ?

367
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:07,462
Why not ?

368
00:18:07,488 --> 00:18:10,000
Just not... no big reason.

369
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,870
- Just a bunch of little reasons.
- Come on.

370
00:18:13,645 --> 00:18:16,603
Roy's right. There's no guarantee
it's gonna lead to anything anyway.

371
00:18:16,956 --> 00:18:18,592
Roy said that ?

372
00:18:19,906 --> 00:18:22,193
What ? You have something
you wanna say ?

373
00:18:23,698 --> 00:18:27,161
You gotta take a chance
on something sometime, Pam.

374
00:18:27,705 --> 00:18:30,231
I mean, do you wanna be a
receptionist here, always ?

375
00:18:30,397 --> 00:18:33,063
Oh, excuse me!
I'm fine with my choices.

376
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:35,833
You are ?

377
00:18:36,176 --> 00:18:37,351
Yeah.

378
00:18:38,405 --> 00:18:39,661
It's impractical.

379
00:18:39,766 --> 00:18:43,412
I'm not gonna...
try to get a house like that.

380
00:18:43,925 --> 00:18:46,031
They don't even make
houses like that in Scranton.

381
00:18:46,216 --> 00:18:48,510
So I'm never gonna...

382
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:58,162
Just gonna push this over there!

383
00:18:59,287 --> 00:19:01,950
This is not a good idea right here.

384
00:19:04,138 --> 00:19:06,262
Easy does it, okay.

385
00:19:11,938 --> 00:19:13,422
Pizza.

386
00:19:13,497 --> 00:19:15,751
Great equalizer.

387
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:18,333
Rich people love pizza.
Poor people love pizza.

388
00:19:18,466 --> 00:19:20,781
White people love pizza.
Black people love pizza.

389
00:19:22,147 --> 00:19:24,022
Do black people like pizza ?

390
00:19:34,728 --> 00:19:35,771
Hey.

391
00:19:37,648 --> 00:19:39,873
Look guys, I'm sorry.

392
00:19:40,187 --> 00:19:43,343
Sometimes, Jan... can be such a bitch.

393
00:19:45,148 --> 00:19:48,672
Hey, watch it, watch it.
We have a relationship.

394
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:50,831
Thank you to our host.

395
00:19:51,008 --> 00:19:52,542
Hey Michael !

396
00:19:52,796 --> 00:19:55,000
This ain't over.

397
00:20:02,907 --> 00:20:03,903
Excellent.

398
00:20:03,975 --> 00:20:07,700
Is it good to be back ? Yeah. I mean,
I love the guy stuff, But...

399
00:20:07,888 --> 00:20:10,010
To run an office,
you need men and women.

400
00:20:10,137 --> 00:20:12,932
You know why ? Because you need to have

401
00:20:13,027 --> 00:20:16,162
that crazy sexual tension
to keep things interesting.

402
00:20:27,475 --> 00:20:29,730
Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.

403
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,262
Hold please.

Это очень здорово видеть всех вас здесь видеть.

"Женщины на рабочем месте"

5
00:00:09,725 --> 00:00:12,568
Джен приезжает из управления,
чтобы оговорить со всеми женщинами о...

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,507
на самом деле даже не знаю о чем.

7
00:00:16,704 --> 00:00:18,003
Но Майклу запрещено посещать это.

8
00:00:18,494 --> 00:00:20,055
Она повторила это около пяти раз.

9
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:23,482
Женщины сегодня,
несмотря на равные с мужчинами права

10
00:00:24,015 --> 00:00:27,250
часто сталкивается с определенными препятствиями.

11
00:00:29,249 --> 00:00:30,920
- Привет, о чем речь?
- Майкл, я...

12
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:32,276
Да, но знаешь? Я просто...

13
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:34,821
Я просто хотел кое-что сказать

14
00:00:35,746 --> 00:00:37,770
- Что ты делаешь?
- Просто послушай.

15
00:00:38,657 --> 00:00:40,703
Что более важно, чем качество?

16
00:00:40,978 --> 00:00:41,972
Равноправие.

17
00:00:42,035 --> 00:00:44,602
В настоящее время ТВ-программы говорят, 
что современные женщины

18
00:00:44,658 --> 00:00:47,810
женщины-Элли Макбил, как я их называю,
поставлены перед выбором...

19
00:00:48,055 --> 00:00:49,971
- Майкл...
- И, нет, я...

20
00:00:50,196 --> 00:00:51,940
<i>You have come a long way, baby.
(рекламный слоган женских сигарет)</i>

21
00:00:52,065 --> 00:00:54,703
Но, я хочу посмотреть на проблему в корне.

22
00:00:54,848 --> 00:00:57,002
- Они сделали так в Олбани.
- Тебе запрещено присутствовать

23
00:00:57,046 --> 00:00:58,530
- на этом собрании.
- И они...

24
00:00:58,656 --> 00:01:00,411
В лактационной комнате, которые я считаю отвратительными

25
00:01:00,497 --> 00:01:02,441
Тебе на самом деле запрещено здесь находится.

26
00:01:02,545 --> 00:01:04,791
- Я их босс, поэтому я чувствую...
- Я твой босс.

27
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,342
- Кто-нибудь хочет кофе?
- Нет, спасибо, Майкл.

28
00:01:12,418 --> 00:01:13,742
Мы хотим, чтобы ты покинул помещение.

29
00:01:13,797 --> 00:01:15,291
<i>"Женщины на рабочем месте".</i>

30
00:01:15,847 --> 00:01:19,550
Да, это значит, что меня не допускают в собственный конференц-зал..

31
00:01:19,615 --> 00:01:21,581
А Джен может там секретничать с нашими девочками.

32
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:24,033
<i>Ах, извините, сегодня "Женщины на рабочем месте".</i>

33
00:01:24,147 --> 00:01:25,321
О чем они говорят? Я не знаю...

34
00:01:25,465 --> 00:01:27,561
Одежда, я...

35
00:01:29,525 --> 00:01:32,182
Девочки, мне очень, очень жаль.

36
00:01:32,398 --> 00:01:34,230
Давайте попробуем заново?

37
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:36,342
- Нас прервали. Мне действительно...
- Джен.

38
00:01:36,437 --> 00:01:38,331
- неловко из-за этого.
- Да, Пэм.

39
00:01:38,596 --> 00:01:40,461
- Майкл все еще у двери.
- Майкл!

45
00:02:14,857 --> 00:02:17,691
<i>разное восприятие уверенности в себе у женщин и мужчин.</i>

Это ужасная идея.

49

Что именно?

50
00:02:27,415 --> 00:02:29,072
Они, собранные там вместе.

51
00:02:29,346 --> 00:02:32,563
Они сидят там слишком долго, разговор пошел по второму кругу.

00:02:49,488 --> 00:02:51,541
<i>Итак, для начала, я бы хотел
</i>

60
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:53,841
<i>чтобы мы немного взбодрились.
Давайте похлопаем в ладоши.</i>

61
00:02:53,945 --> 00:02:55,061
Давайте, готовы?

62
00:02:58,488 --> 00:02:59,712
Да, именно так!

63
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:01,630
Я не знаю, что ты делаешь здесь, Майкл.

64
00:03:01,676 --> 00:03:04,142
У нас тоже небольшое собрание "Парни на рабочем месте".

65
00:03:04,496 --> 00:03:07,703
Почему мальчикам нельзя играть в куклы?

66
00:03:08,365 --> 00:03:10,611
Почему общество,

67
00:03:10,798 --> 00:03:14,323
навязывает использование писсуаров, когда сидеть на унитазе гораздо удобнее?

68
00:03:14,425 --> 00:03:16,513
Вы не могли бы заниматься этим где-нибудь в другом месте, Майкл?

69
00:03:16,605 --> 00:03:19,083
Нам больше негде, Джен, я...

70
00:03:19,688 --> 00:03:21,052
Мы могли бы пойти на склад.

71
00:03:21,178 --> 00:03:23,042
Двайт. Прекрасная идея.
Идите на склад.

72
00:03:23,187 --> 00:03:24,583
Ладно, вообще-то... Прекрасно.

73
00:03:24,725 --> 00:03:26,393
Замечательно. Знаете что?

74
00:03:26,518 --> 00:03:29,520
У этой идеи есть еще один плюс, джентльмены.

75
00:03:29,757 --> 00:03:33,543
Я знаю, всем нам нравится наша непыльная работа
и непринужденная атмосфера здесь, в офисе.

76
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:36,953
Но задумайтесь, что под нами внизу находится другой мир.

77
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:38,613
мир склада.

78
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:43,663
Мир, изобилующий потом, грязью и жизнью.

79
00:03:44,635 --> 00:03:45,661
Жизнью.

80
00:03:46,045 --> 00:03:47,743
Внутренности офиса.

81
00:03:47,868 --> 00:03:51,862
<i>Эти ребята там внизу.
Настоящие мужчины, делающие настоящую мужскую. работу.</i>

82
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,160
<i>Сегодня мы познакомимся с работой склада.</i>

83
00:03:58,056 --> 00:03:59,960
Я думаю, это хорошая идея

84
00:04:00,127 --> 00:04:03,823
т.к.  управление складов является важной частью моей работы.

85
00:04:03,908 --> 00:04:06,270
И я не был там месяцы.

86
00:04:29,597 --> 00:04:32,732
Помните эпизод "Остаться в живых",
когда они встретили других?

87
00:04:35,326 --> 00:04:37,903
Я прошу прощения.

88
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:41,290
Итак, на чем мы остановились?
Пэм, ты успеваешь записывать?

89
00:04:42,217 --> 00:04:44,401
Точно? Спасибо.

90
00:04:44,596 --> 00:04:46,241
Итак, давайте познакомимся со складом!

91
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:48,663
Давайте я познакомлю вас.

92
00:04:48,836 --> 00:04:50,942
Крупный план.

93
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:53,990
Это Дэррил, один из работников склада.

94
00:04:54,235 --> 00:04:58,160
- Дэррил, чего ты больше всего боишься?
- Больше всего я боюсь, что кто-то

95
00:04:58,246 --> 00:05:00,561
сорвет нам график поставок.

96
00:05:00,687 --> 00:05:04,201
На самом деле Дэррил бригадир здесь. А Рой нет. Он поспокойнее.

97
00:05:04,677 --> 00:05:06,660
Вот Рой, он управляет подъемником.

98
00:05:07,068 --> 00:05:10,882
Рой собрался жениться на Пэм этим летом.

99
00:05:11,225 --> 00:05:14,753
Она... наша секретарша.
Наподобие БрАнджелины.

100
00:05:15,147 --> 00:05:16,120
Почему?

101
00:05:16,395 --> 00:05:19,603
БрАнджелина - это Брэд Питт и Анджелина.

102
00:05:19,806 --> 00:05:22,542
- Я не понял.
- Рой, Рой и Пэм. Рэм.

103
00:05:22,848 --> 00:05:24,143
Это Рэм.

104
00:05:24,297 --> 00:05:27,353
Готов поспорить Рой слышал о том, что тебе нравится Пэм.

105
00:05:27,966 --> 00:05:30,361
Готов поспорить, он попытается побить тебя.

106
00:05:30,608 --> 00:05:32,482
Спасибо что предупредил, Кев.

107
00:05:32,626 --> 00:05:34,500
Я прикрою тебя, если он попробует.

108
00:05:38,145 --> 00:05:39,433
Но старайся держаться подальше от него.

109
00:05:40,656 --> 00:05:43,052
Это на случай если среди нас посторонний.

110
00:05:43,178 --> 00:05:45,501
Вроде ситуации из фильма "Умница Уилл Хантинг"

111
00:05:45,597 --> 00:05:47,093
Итак, солдаты.

112
00:05:47,268 --> 00:05:50,770
Сегодня важный день.
Большой день.

113
00:05:50,887 --> 00:05:55,543
Мы можете посмотреть по сторонам
и увидите две группы людей.

114
00:05:56,915 --> 00:05:58,230
"Белые воротнички", "синие воротнички"...

115
00:05:58,355 --> 00:06:01,241
Но я смотрю на вещи по-другому.
И знаете почему?

116
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:04,163
Я не различаю цвета.

117
00:06:05,778 --> 00:06:07,710
Предлагаю каждой из вас сказать по кругу

118
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,461
в чем вы сильны.

119
00:06:09,548 --> 00:06:12,261
Начну я. У меня хорошие ораторские способности.

120
00:06:13,198 --> 00:06:16,841
Привет, я Мередит, и я хороший дистрибьютор.

121
00:06:17,287 --> 00:06:18,611
Отлично. Филлис.

122
00:06:19,398 --> 00:06:23,411
Я хорошо разбираюсь в компьютерном деле.
электронная почта, Эксель и т.д.

123
00:06:23,655 --> 00:06:25,123
Неужели?

124
00:06:25,245 --> 00:06:27,961
- Ну не знаю, я думала что...
- Так. Стоп.

125
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:31,211
Знаешь, я видела некоторые твои таблицы. 
И почти всегда...

126
00:06:31,296 --> 00:06:33,620
<i>Не думаю, что у меня есть 
что-то общее с этими женщинами.</i>

127
00:06:34,397 --> 00:06:35,341
Тут, в офисе.

128
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,080
Или даже с Джен.

129
00:06:37,748 --> 00:06:40,191
Т.е., мы хорошо ладим.

130
00:06:41,827 --> 00:06:45,253
Думаю единственный человек здесь,
с которым у меня есть что-то общее - это

131
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,243
Джим.

132
00:06:47,686 --> 00:06:49,102
Халперт.

133
00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:52,872
Знаешь, ходят слухи о том

134
00:06:53,098 --> 00:06:54,972
что ты подкатываешь к Пэм и...

135
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:56,802
-  О, нет, нет, нет.
- Нет, нет. Все нормально.

136
00:06:56,905 --> 00:06:59,340
Я знаю, ты хороший парень
и все это дело в прошлом

137
00:06:59,495 --> 00:07:03,012
так что... Все нормально, да?

138
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:06,243
Да. Да, конечно.

139
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:08,393
Вообще-то для меня это даже хорошо, потому что

140
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:11,223
я рад, что у нее есть друг на работе, с которым можно поговорить.

141
00:07:11,268 --> 00:07:14,030
Тогда после работы она не болтает без умолку.

142
00:07:14,085 --> 00:07:17,340
- Мне тоже нравится общаться с ней.
- Так что все нормально, да?

143
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,096
- Да, да.
- Хорошо.

144
00:07:20,179 --> 00:07:22,450
- Все круто.
- Отлично.

145
00:07:29,636 --> 00:07:31,986
Эй, Майк, слушай. Как насчет того, чтобы мы сходили наверх?

146
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:34,223
- Познакомимся с работой офиса.
- О, ну...

147
00:07:34,337 --> 00:07:36,071
Мы могли бы поменяться рабочими местами на день.

148
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:39,343
Да, знаешь что? Я не, вы...

149
00:07:39,495 --> 00:07:40,931
Моя работа полный отстой по сравнению с этим.

150
00:07:41,005 --> 00:07:42,992
Не думаю, что вам бы понравилось там наверху.
Парни!

151
00:07:43,118 --> 00:07:45,550
Хотите разгрузить тележку?

152
00:07:46,696 --> 00:07:48,352
Хорошо, давайте.

153
00:07:48,865 --> 00:07:49,923
Поднимайся.

154
00:07:50,056 --> 00:07:52,510
Зацените. Посмотрите на это.

155
00:07:52,665 --> 00:07:53,932
Посмотрите.

156
00:07:54,227 --> 00:07:56,671
"Привет, как пожива...
O-кей.

157
00:07:59,848 --> 00:08:00,892
Отлично.

158
00:08:00,957 --> 00:08:02,910
Хорошая шутка.

159
00:08:03,157 --> 00:08:06,352
Через пять лет я хотела бы быть человеком,
который не пил пять лет.

160
00:08:07,275 --> 00:08:09,030
Это превосходная цель.

161
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,543
Четыре с половиной.

162
00:08:10,915 --> 00:08:13,721
Я скажу вам, я не собираюсь становиться одной из тех женщин

163
00:08:13,847 --> 00:08:15,773
которые таскают с собой детей в своем минивэне.

164
00:08:16,016 --> 00:08:17,403
Отлично.

165
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:20,031
Я хочу внедорожник с тремя рядами сидений.

166
00:08:21,688 --> 00:08:24,330
Хорошо, я буду честна. Одна из причин
проведения таких женских семинаров

167
00:08:24,435 --> 00:08:27,222
выявление ярких личностей.
Женщины, которые могли бы быть ценным

168
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,551
приобретением для корпорации.

169
00:08:33,148 --> 00:08:34,631
Майкл хочет сплотить нас.

170
00:08:34,758 --> 00:08:36,830
Так что нам нужна тема для разговора.

171
00:08:36,978 --> 00:08:38,950
- Пони.
-  Нет.

172
00:08:39,077 --> 00:08:40,443
Как насчет радуги?

173
00:08:40,565 --> 00:08:42,510
- Нет.
- Цветы.

174
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:44,012
<i>- Нет.
- Макияж.</i>

175
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:45,782
Эй, это небезопасно.

176
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:48,073
- Отойди.
- Майк, слезь с подъемника.

177
00:08:48,176 --> 00:08:50,242
- Все нормально, все нормально.
- Давай, слезай.

178
00:08:50,938 --> 00:08:53,572
Не мог бы ты... послушай. Майкл.

179
00:08:59,568 --> 00:09:01,050
Мы вызовем кого-нибудь, чтобы прибраться тут.

180
00:09:01,148 --> 00:09:03,590
Кроме нас никто не будет это убирать!

181
00:09:03,866 --> 00:09:05,690
Черт, Майкл!

182
00:09:05,976 --> 00:09:07,752
Мы все уберем.

183
00:09:07,977 --> 00:09:10,191
Так, собрание продолжается.

184
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:11,512
Так.

185
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:15,352
Хотя мы и живем в разных мирах,

186
00:09:15,747 --> 00:09:17,473
Между нами много общего.

187
00:09:17,846 --> 00:09:20,750
Нам даже нравится одни и те же девочки, некоторым из нас.

188
00:09:21,355 --> 00:09:22,653
Такое случается.

189
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,802
Мы же мужчины, так что...

190
00:09:24,986 --> 00:09:26,822
Эй... вы хотите, чтобы я ушла?

191
00:09:27,685 --> 00:09:30,193
Нет, почему я должен хотеть... но если хочешь...

192
00:09:30,638 --> 00:09:32,932
- Я ухожу...
- Можешь остаться или...

193
00:09:33,717 --> 00:09:36,031
И еще большой шкаф для одежды.

194
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,782
- Это часть моей мечты тоже.
- О, и моей.

195
00:09:38,935 --> 00:09:40,452
Хорошо. Хорошо.

196
00:09:41,258 --> 00:09:44,173
А ты, Пэм, как насчет тебя?
Какая у тебя мечта?

197
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:45,442
Ну,

198
00:09:46,006 --> 00:09:49,010
Я мечтаю о доме с террасой на верхнем этаже.

199
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,090
Посадить там цветы и все в таком духе.

200
00:09:51,518 --> 00:09:53,463
Мечтаю об этом с детства.

201
00:09:54,905 --> 00:09:57,862
Если серьезно, о муже, которого я люблю.

202
00:09:58,816 --> 00:09:59,902
О Рое.

203
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,911
И... еще я люблю рисовать.

204
00:10:03,616 --> 00:10:06,420
Я рисовала немного в колледже.
И до сих пор люблю делать что-то

205
00:10:06,528 --> 00:10:08,970
связанное с рисунком или дизайном.

206
00:10:09,096 --> 00:10:10,120
У нее здорово выходит.

207
00:10:10,198 --> 00:10:14,912
Знаешь, компания может отправить тебя
на дизайнерские семинары в Нью-Йорке.

208
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:17,921
Сейчас я работаю.
Так что у меня нет времени на это.

209
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:20,812
Это только по выходным.
А затем пара недель в Нью-Йорке.

210
00:10:20,896 --> 00:10:24,071
Но я уверена, что в управлении пойдут навстречу.

211
00:10:24,155 --> 00:10:26,251
К тому же выходные не очень удобны, потому что...

212
00:10:26,388 --> 00:10:29,552
Всегда найдется миллион причин не делать чего-то.

213
00:10:33,307 --> 00:10:35,073
Давайте начнем со склада.

214
00:10:35,206 --> 00:10:37,003
Что беспокоит вас как парней?

215
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:39,291
- Понимаете?
- Больше всего - безопасность.

216
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:39,743
Oкей.

217
00:10:39,896 --> 00:10:43,183
Поэтому меня здорово напрягает, когда кто-нибудь приходит сюда 
и начинает кататься по складу на погрузчике,

218
00:10:43,307 --> 00:10:46,481
считая это детской забавой.
Это просто выводит меня из себя, oкей?

219
00:10:47,976 --> 00:10:49,590
- Не шикай на меня.
- Нет, я...

220
00:10:49,698 --> 00:10:51,342
- Это было просто... дыхание.
- Это тоже раздражает меня.

221
00:10:51,435 --> 00:10:54,231
- Когда Пэм шикает на меня, это сводит меня с ума.
- Меня тоже бесит шикание.

222
00:10:54,307 --> 00:10:59,343
Это так. Что ж, хорошо.
Что нас больше всего раздражает как мужчин?

223
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,553
Это хороший вопрос, Хасселхофф.

224
00:11:04,546 --> 00:11:06,522
- Окей. Хорошо.
- Что выводит нас из себя??

225
00:11:06,595 --> 00:11:08,602
Хорошо. Парни подкалывают друг друга.

226
00:11:08,856 --> 00:11:11,692
Это то, что они обычно делают.
И мне нравится это.

227
00:11:11,877 --> 00:11:15,272
Хорошо, давай те поговорим об... одежде.

228
00:11:16,138 --> 00:11:19,263
Я в восторге от сегодняшнего семинара.
Обожаю женские разговоры.

229
00:11:19,987 --> 00:11:22,910
Одежда для работы, которую вы хотите, не для работы в офисе.

230
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,080
Вы можете использовать одежду как посыл о ваших амбициях.

231
00:11:26,217 --> 00:11:29,963
одеваясь в то, что отражает ваши стремления.

232
00:11:30,038 --> 00:11:32,061
<i>Это семинар не научил меня ничему новому.</i>

233
00:11:32,198 --> 00:11:35,222
Я профессионал. Главный бухгалтер.

234
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,010
У меня здоровые отношения в моей жизни.

235
00:11:38,216 --> 00:11:41,262
Думаю, это оскорбительно, что Джен считает, будто нам нужно это.

236
00:11:41,497 --> 00:11:45,032
И очевидно, что
по ее логике...

237
00:11:45,188 --> 00:11:47,951
Джен стремиться быть шлюхой.

238
00:11:48,468 --> 00:11:50,880
Я ненавижу, когда девушка требует 
водить ее в новый ресторан каждые выходные

239
00:11:50,956 --> 00:11:54,062
а потом такая:

240
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:56,011
"Когда у нас будет настоящее свидание?"

241
00:11:56,498 --> 00:11:57,950
Точно!

242
00:11:58,075 --> 00:11:59,192
Это невыносимо.

243
00:11:59,457 --> 00:12:02,303
Да, а на следующее утро она заставит тебя поехать в церковь.

244
00:12:02,406 --> 00:12:04,432
Бензин не бесплатный!

245
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,462
Да, это при нашей зарплате, на что они рассчитывают?

246
00:12:08,508 --> 00:12:10,922
"ресторан каждые выходные"...
Понимаете о чем я?

247
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:13,202
- Мы не миллионеры.
- Понимаю.

248
00:12:13,256 --> 00:12:15,730
Нет, не понимаешь. Как ты можешь?
Знаешь что?

249
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,632
- Не буквально.
- Вы говорите, что мы похожи,

250
00:12:17,718 --> 00:12:19,873
Наши зарплаты сильно отличаются.

251
00:12:19,915 --> 00:12:21,581
- Да.
- Мы работаем столько же часов,

252
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,252
И как ты говорил наша работа немного тяжелее.

253
00:12:23,337 --> 00:12:26,670
- Ну да, но...
- Но зарплата наша намного меньше.

254
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,741
- Да.
- К тому же никаких льгот.

255
00:12:28,895 --> 00:12:30,843
Понимаю. Боже, да что же это такое?!

256
00:12:30,915 --> 00:12:32,972
-Точно!
-Черт! Черт!

257
00:12:33,047 --> 00:12:35,583
Знаешь, этого бы не случилось, если бы у нас был профсоюз.

258
00:12:35,715 --> 00:12:37,683
- Об этом я и говорил.
- Да, но.

259
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:40,051
- Определенно это то что нам нужно.
- Смотри.

260
00:12:40,197 --> 00:12:41,680
Вот что я скажу.

261
00:12:41,815 --> 00:12:43,191
Мы наконец должны это сделать.

262
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:46,953
Разве это необходимо? У нас уже есть "Объединение парней".

263
00:12:47,206 --> 00:12:49,950
Это более чем необходимо, Майк, Нам нужно это.

264
00:12:50,098 --> 00:12:53,020
Рой, у тебя осталась карточка профсоюза портовых грузчиков?

265
00:12:53,097 --> 00:12:55,793
- В моем погрузчике.
-  Давай!

266
00:12:56,406 --> 00:12:59,580
Да, знаешь, думаю на самом деле проблема в телках.

267
00:12:59,817 --> 00:13:01,892
- Профсоюз, да!
- Проблема в телках.

268
00:13:02,075 --> 00:13:04,611
Вот что вы должны осуждать
269
00:13:05,746 --> 00:13:07,871
Ты с нами, Майк?

270
00:13:08,695 --> 00:13:10,313
Добро пожаловать на склад.

271
00:13:14,948 --> 00:13:18,620
Еще одна проблема - разница в оплате труда мужчин и женщин.

272
00:13:18,947 --> 00:13:21,461
Уверена, все вы сталкивались с этим.

273
00:13:21,685 --> 00:13:23,920
Это важно.
Девочки, небольшая передышка.

274
00:13:24,756 --> 00:13:28,823
Джен, я хотел...

275
00:13:29,057 --> 00:13:30,952
Я могу помочь?

276
00:13:32,677 --> 00:13:37,001
Я хотел сказать, что парни там внизу задумали организовать профсоюз.

277
00:13:37,076 --> 00:13:39,553
- Что? Профсоюз? Я не...
- У них есть весомые аргументы.

278
00:13:39,606 --> 00:13:42,430
Часть моей работы - умение общаться с женщинами.

279
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:45,540
Давай... будем... рациональными... тут.

280
00:13:46,335 --> 00:13:47,903
Взвесим все плюсы и минусы.

281
00:13:47,945 --> 00:13:50,680
Минус в том, что все потеряют свою работу. Все, Майкл.

282
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:53,063
Офис, склад.

283
00:13:53,228 --> 00:13:56,993
Какие ты думаешь могут быть плюсы... здесь?

284
00:13:57,178 --> 00:13:59,892
Не говори со мной в таком тоне, пожалуйста. Просто...

285
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,403
Они хотят услышать это от тебя.

286
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,140
Ты сам влез в это, Майкл, так что

287
00:14:04,575 --> 00:14:06,960
- Знаешь, я пытаюсь сплотить нас там внизу.
- Это очень плохо.

288
00:14:07,037 --> 00:14:10,233
Я просто не хочу говорить им того, чего они не хотят услышать.

289
00:14:10,337 --> 00:14:12,190
Да ладно, Джен. После всего, что было между нами.

290
00:14:12,287 --> 00:14:13,951
- Майкл, Майкл.
- У нас есть прошлое.

291
00:14:14,077 --> 00:14:16,101
- Майкл.
- У нас есть прошлое. Наше с тобой.

292
00:14:16,176 --> 00:14:21,313
Не говори больше ничего.
Иди... спускайся... в подвал.

293
00:14:21,807 --> 00:14:24,791
Я просто говорю, что у нас есть что-то... 
Ладно, неважно.

294
00:14:26,745 --> 00:14:28,253
Знаешь что?

295
00:14:28,426 --> 00:14:31,593
Мы могли бы закончить быстрее, 
если бы передавали коробки друг другу.

296
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:35,412
Нам не нужно выполнять работу быстро.

297
00:14:35,598 --> 00:14:37,640
Как и в офисе.

298
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:41,200
Спортивные метафоры - одна из вещей, 
где женщина может почувствовать себя неполноценной

299
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:44,002
общаясь на работе.
Знаю, это может звучать глупо,

300
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:47,121
но многие женщины просят разъяснить им их.
Итак... Промазать - значит....?

301
00:14:47,188 --> 00:14:48,672
<i>- Совершить ошибку.
- Промахнуться.</i>

302
00:14:48,768 --> 00:14:49,560
Правильно.

303
00:14:49,717 --> 00:14:53,292
Пар - разумеется термин из гольфа, 
что значит легкую для удара ситуацию.


304
00:14:54,267 --> 00:14:58,933
Также "пар" - значит плохой.
Стойте. Это как-то странно.

305
00:14:59,006 --> 00:15:00,623
А что такое "вторая база"?

306
00:15:00,688 --> 00:15:04,012
Например, Майкл как-то сказал у него с вами вторая база.

307
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,701
- Это значит он заключил сделку?
- Прости?

308
00:15:06,878 --> 00:15:09,902
- Ну, это ведь бейсбольный термин, да?
- Я не знаю.

309
00:15:09,988 --> 00:15:13,192
Майкл... имел ввиду...

310
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,080
- Привет.
-Привет!

311
00:15:23,496 --> 00:15:24,731
Как у вас там?

312
00:15:24,826 --> 00:15:28,312
Превосходно. На самом деле как обычно...

313
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,290
- Как девочки?
- Хорошо.

314
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:32,863
Мы посмотрели видео о пластических операциях.

315
00:15:33,088 --> 00:15:35,532
- Серьезно?
-  Нет.

316
00:15:35,677 --> 00:15:36,852
Почти.

317
00:15:39,328 --> 00:15:42,510
Интересная тема. Есть возможность пойти на 
курсы графического дизайна

318
00:15:42,626 --> 00:15:46,651
как сказала нам Джен.
Судя ее словам это что-то стоящее.

319
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:48,952
Неплохо. Слушай, зачем тебе это?

320
00:15:49,055 --> 00:15:51,831
Соглашайся.
Это здорово!

321
00:15:52,757 --> 00:15:54,192
Это реально клево.

322
00:15:54,337 --> 00:15:57,753
Холодный фронт надвигается на склад!

323
00:15:59,295 --> 00:16:01,242
Пора готовить лыжи!

324
00:16:05,828 --> 00:16:08,132
С Новым годом, Дэррил!

325
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,621
Эй, Дэррил!

326
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:14,453
Ты пробовал так делать?

327
00:16:16,548 --> 00:16:17,782
Вы замужем?

328
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:20,600
- Я разведена.
- Это наверное тяжело.

329
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:21,822
Было тяжело. Да.

330
00:16:21,845 --> 00:16:24,312
Наверное вы чувствовали себя по-настоящему 
подавлено и уныло.

331
00:16:24,496 --> 00:16:26,803
И поэтому вы сделали это с Майклом.

332
00:16:26,836 --> 00:16:29,650
Думаю, вас больше должна беспокоить ваша карьера.

333
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,701
и меньше - чужая личная жизнь.

334
00:16:31,785 --> 00:16:34,130
Я думаю, мы нашли хороший баланс между тем и другим.

335
00:16:34,265 --> 00:16:36,781
По крайней мере,  у вас нет детей.
У вас ведь нет?

336
00:16:36,935 --> 00:16:38,063
- Слава богу
-  Так

337
00:16:38,195 --> 00:16:40,603
Давайте устроем перерыв.
Думаю, он всем нам не помешает.

338
00:16:42,838 --> 00:16:45,731
Как можно быть такой красивой и такой занудной?

339
00:16:48,935 --> 00:16:50,943
- Привет.
- Прояснил ситуацию?

340
00:16:51,105 --> 00:16:52,933
Да, да. Да.

341
00:16:53,257 --> 00:16:55,623
-Я... Я... В целом
- Извини.

342
00:16:55,957 --> 00:16:57,473
- Да, я взял...
- Извини.

343
00:16:57,488 --> 00:17:00,283
До меня дошли слухи, что у кого-то 
возникла идея создать профсоюз

344
00:17:00,388 --> 00:17:01,912
И Майкл поддержал ее.

345
00:17:02,028 --> 00:17:03,533
Что явно говорит не в его пользу,

346
00:17:03,635 --> 00:17:06,171
Т.к. он не рассказал о подробностях.
Так что позвольте мне.

347
00:17:06,306 --> 00:17:09,051
Если вы будете настаивать на профсоюзе,

348
00:17:09,136 --> 00:17:11,882
я гарантирую, вы потеряете работу как пальцем щелкнуть.

349
00:17:12,035 --> 00:17:15,083
В Питсфилде был создан профсоюз. 
Все мы знаем, что произошло затем в Питсфилде.

350
00:17:15,215 --> 00:17:17,721
Вам придется дорого заплатить за оформление всех документов,

351
00:17:17,817 --> 00:17:20,932
вы будете постоянно платить членские взносы, 
но это ничто по сравнению с риском потерять работу

352
00:17:20,997 --> 00:17:24,761
Так что на вашем месте я бы хорошенько подумала, 

353
00:17:24,818 --> 00:17:27,490
прежде чем рисковать текущими гарантиями.

354
00:17:27,998 --> 00:17:30,900
Если возникнут какие-то вопросы, можете обратиться с ними к...

355
00:17:32,795 --> 00:17:34,231
к Майклу.

356
00:17:37,365 --> 00:17:38,901
<i>Таковы мечты.</i>

357
00:17:39,056 --> 00:17:41,942
<i>Они помогают тебе коротать день</i>

358
00:17:42,376 --> 00:17:44,742
<i>как например моя мечта о террасе. Это конечно здорово.</i>

359
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,183
Но, мм...

360
00:17:46,545 --> 00:17:49,591
Не знаю. Я прочитала об этом в книге, когда мне было 12.

361
00:17:49,905 --> 00:17:53,963
У девушки из книги была терраса снаружи ее спальни...

362
00:17:54,105 --> 00:17:57,620
<i>И она посадила цветы там.
Я просто влюбилась в это.</i>

363
00:17:58,057 --> 00:18:00,243
<i>Это навсегда засело во мне.</i>

364
00:18:00,336 --> 00:18:02,601
Значит, ты решила не делать этого.

365
00:18:04,086 --> 00:18:06,032
Как ты узнал?

366
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:07,462
Почему?

367
00:18:07,488 --> 00:18:10,000
Просто... нет какой-то большой причины.

368
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,870
- просто куча маленьких причин.
- Да ладно.

369
00:18:13,645 --> 00:18:16,603
Рой прав. Нет гарантии, что это к чему-нибудь приведет.

370
00:18:16,956 --> 00:18:18,592
Рой так сказал?

371
00:18:19,906 --> 00:18:22,193
А что? Ты можешь что-то возразить?

372
00:18:23,698 --> 00:18:27,161
Ты не должна упускать шанса, Пэм.

373
00:18:27,705 --> 00:18:30,231
В смысле, ты хочешь всю жизнь работать секретаршей тут?

374
00:18:30,397 --> 00:18:33,063
О, извините!
У меня все в порядке в жизни.

375
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:35,833
Да?

376
00:18:36,176 --> 00:18:37,351
Да.

377
00:18:38,405 --> 00:18:39,661
Это непрактично

378
00:18:39,766 --> 00:18:43,412
Я не собираюсь...
купить в будущем такой дом.

379
00:18:43,925 --> 00:18:46,031
Такие дома даже не строят в Скрэнтоне.

380
00:18:46,216 --> 00:18:48,510
Так что у меня никогда не будет...

381
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:58,162
Просто подтолкну это в ту сторону.

382
00:18:59,287 --> 00:19:01,950
Это не очень хорошая идея.

383
00:19:04,138 --> 00:19:06,262
Всего и делов.

384
00:19:11,938 --> 00:19:13,422
Пицца.

385
00:19:13,497 --> 00:19:15,751
Всех уравнивает.

386
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:18,333
Богатые любят пиццу.
Бедные любят пиццу.

387
00:19:18,466 --> 00:19:20,781
Белые любят пиццу.
Черные любят пиццу.

388
00:19:22,147 --> 00:19:24,022
Черные любят пиццу?

389
00:19:37,648 --> 00:19:39,873
Слушайте, парни, простите.

390
00:19:40,187 --> 00:19:42,344
Иногда Джен... 

391
00:19:42,344 --> 00:19:44,344
бывает такой сукой.

392
00:19:45,148 --> 00:19:48,672
Ну ладно, ладно...
Я с ней встречаюсь.

393
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:50,831
Спасибо за гостеприимство.

394
00:19:51,008 --> 00:19:52,542
Эй, Майкл!

395
00:19:52,796 --> 00:19:55,000
Мы не закончили.

396
00:20:02,907 --> 00:20:03,903
Превосходно.

397
00:20:03,975 --> 00:20:07,700
Здорово вернуться обратно? Да, в смысле, 
мне нравятся все эти мужские разговоры, но...

398
00:20:07,888 --> 00:20:10,010
Чтобы ваш офис работал, нужны и мужчины, и женщины.

399
00:20:10,137 --> 00:20:12,932
Знаете почему? 
Вам нужно это сумасшедшее 

400
00:20:13,027 --> 00:20:16,162
сексуальное напряжение,
чтобы поддерживать стимул.

401
00:20:27,475 --> 00:20:29,730
Дандлер-Миффлин, это Пэм.

402
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,262
Подождите, пожалуйста.

1
00:00:02,745 --> 00:00:05,353
I really like Valentine's Day
in this office.

2
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:07,085
It's kind of like grade school...

3
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:09,232
everybody gives out little
presents and stuff.

4
00:00:09,806 --> 00:00:10,944
Like last year,

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,623
Jim gave me this card
with Dwight's head on it.

6
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:16,409
It was horrifying and funny. And...

7
00:00:24,655 --> 00:00:25,811
Phyllis.

8
00:00:26,204 --> 00:00:27,591
<i>You could just sign here.</i>

9
00:00:28,204 --> 00:00:30,043
<i>Roy and I are saving
for the wedding, so...</i>

10
00:00:30,075 --> 00:00:32,570
I made him promise not to
get me anything too big.

11
00:00:33,323 --> 00:00:35,366
Happy Valentine's Day, Darling,

12
00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:37,740
love Bob Vance,
Vance Refrigeration.

13
00:00:38,146 --> 00:00:39,706
- Isn't he sweet ?
- Yeah.

14
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:40,872
Such a sweetie.

15
00:00:40,947 --> 00:00:44,251
All right, Dwight. As you know,
I'm heading to New York today,

16
00:00:44,305 --> 00:00:48,011
doing a presentation on the branch
to the new CFO.

17
00:00:48,157 --> 00:00:50,801
- And you want me to come with you.
- No. Opposite of that.

18
00:00:51,137 --> 00:00:53,020
I will stay here and
run things on this end.

19
00:00:53,067 --> 00:00:54,260
Very good.

20
00:00:55,047 --> 00:00:57,652
Question. Will you be seeing Jan
when you're in New York ?

21
00:00:57,705 --> 00:00:59,701
I probably will. Why do you ask ?

22
00:00:59,786 --> 00:01:01,851
Well, it's Valentine's Day.

23
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:03,270
And you guys, you know...

24
00:01:05,297 --> 00:01:06,303
Screwed.

25
00:01:06,448 --> 00:01:08,012
What is your problem ?

26
00:01:08,576 --> 00:01:09,913
This is a business trip.

27
00:01:10,245 --> 00:01:12,391
I would have to be a raving lunatic

28
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:15,242
to try to talk to Jan about
what happened between us.

29
00:01:15,546 --> 00:01:16,910
Her words, not mine.

30
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:18,880
She sent me an e-mail this morning.

31
00:01:20,105 --> 00:01:22,881
But, it is Valentine's Day.

32
00:01:24,488 --> 00:01:26,331
It's New York, city of love.

33
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:30,662
Hey, Pam, you heard NY, right ?

34
00:01:30,717 --> 00:01:32,290
You want me to pick
you up anything ?

35
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:33,580
- That's okay.
- All right.

36
00:01:33,645 --> 00:01:35,270
<i>The best present would be,</i>

37
00:01:35,597 --> 00:01:37,443
you do a good job in front
of the new CFO.

38
00:01:37,508 --> 00:01:39,360
Dude, I'm going to nail it.

39
00:01:39,617 --> 00:01:41,951
Me in New York ?
Oh, I own that city.

40
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:43,321
Fuggit abat it !

41
00:01:44,417 --> 00:01:45,532
<i>See ya !</i>

45
00:02:18,795 --> 00:02:20,691
Well, here we go
on our way to New York.

46
00:02:21,326 --> 00:02:22,422
New York, New York.

47
00:02:22,787 --> 00:02:24,613
The city so nice,
they named it twice.

48
00:02:25,128 --> 00:02:26,882
Manhattan is the other name.

49
00:02:28,068 --> 00:02:29,171
<i>So, I broke up with Katy</i>

50
00:02:29,207 --> 00:02:31,410
<i>and haven't been dating
anybody else.</i>

51
00:02:31,435 --> 00:02:34,512
<i>So this year, I don't have to worry
about Valentine's Day.</i>

52
00:02:35,035 --> 00:02:37,321
<i>It's gonna be good.</i>
I invited a couple of friends over,

53
00:02:37,356 --> 00:02:38,520
we're gonna play some cards.

54
00:02:38,577 --> 00:02:40,232
And I'll end up winning
a lot of money,

55
00:02:40,276 --> 00:02:41,832
because, they're idiots.

56
00:02:42,777 --> 00:02:43,882
It's gonna be great.

57
00:02:46,377 --> 00:02:47,692
What's this ?
What is this ?

58
00:02:48,977 --> 00:02:50,632
I don't know.
It's on YOUR desk.

59
00:02:51,277 --> 00:02:53,742
Yeah, but who put it there ?
And for what purpose ?

60
00:02:54,078 --> 00:02:55,713
It was there when I sat down.

61
00:03:03,138 --> 00:03:06,223
Happy Valentine's Day.

62
00:03:15,688 --> 00:03:16,792
It's me.

63
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,490
I'm the bobble head.

64
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:24,133
Yes !

65
00:03:27,828 --> 00:03:28,832
Yeah.

66
00:03:28,928 --> 00:03:30,210
The meeting isn't till 3:00,

67
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:32,692
but I always like to come
to New York a little bit early

68
00:03:32,757 --> 00:03:34,312
and hit some of my favorite haunts.

69
00:03:34,435 --> 00:03:37,210
Like right here is my favorite
New York pizza joint.

70
00:03:38,308 --> 00:03:40,961
And I'm gonna go get me
a New York slice.

71
00:03:44,097 --> 00:03:45,172
Hey, Kelly.

72
00:03:45,415 --> 00:03:47,421
- What's up ?
- Nothing.

73
00:03:47,655 --> 00:03:49,321
Oh, except, oh my God, Jim.

74
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:52,841
Last  night, Ryan and I totally,
finally, hooked up.

75
00:03:52,938 --> 00:03:54,693
- It was awesome.
- That's great.

76
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:55,812
I'm really happy for you.

77
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:56,991
I know. And it was so funny.

78
00:03:57,018 --> 00:03:58,851
'Cause we were at this bar
with his friends,

79
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,840
and I was sitting next to him
the whole night.

80
00:04:00,886 --> 00:04:03,203
And he wasn't making a move,
so in my head, I was like,

81
00:04:03,246 --> 00:04:06,102
"Ryan, what's taking you so long ?"
And then he kissed me.

82
00:04:06,195 --> 00:04:08,113
And I didn't know what to say.
So I said,

83
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,513
"Ryan, what took, you so long ?"

84
00:04:10,536 --> 00:04:12,770
I mean, I just said it to him.
Can you believe that ?

85
00:04:13,157 --> 00:04:15,102
Oh my God, Jim.
Is that embarrassing ?

86
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:17,612
- I'm embarrassed.
- No, don't be. No.

87
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:18,923
- Oh, thank God.
- All ri...

88
00:04:18,945 --> 00:04:21,340
Because I was nervous, Jim.
You will not believe.

89
00:04:21,385 --> 00:04:22,591
- I bet.
- I was so nervous.

90
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,653
But now, now I have a boyfriend.

91
00:04:24,685 --> 00:04:26,062
All right.

92
00:04:26,787 --> 00:04:29,360
I hooked up with her
on February 13th.

93
00:04:32,216 --> 00:04:35,352
Here it is. Heart of New York City.
Times Square.

94
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:39,922
Named for all the good times
you have when you're in it.

95
00:04:40,717 --> 00:04:42,541
Most people when they come
to New York,

96
00:04:42,595 --> 00:04:44,862
they go straight to
the Empire State Building.

97
00:04:45,036 --> 00:04:46,883
That's very touristy. I come here.

98
00:04:47,107 --> 00:04:48,383
Great places to eat.

99
00:04:48,415 --> 00:04:51,230
We have Bubba Gump Shrimp,
Red Lobster down there.

100
00:04:51,845 --> 00:04:53,903
You know. This is...

101
00:04:53,988 --> 00:04:56,343
this is the heart of civilization
right here.

102
00:05:05,287 --> 00:05:06,543
Guess what ?

103
00:05:06,727 --> 00:05:07,801
Really ?

104
00:05:09,406 --> 00:05:11,421
- They're from Bob again.
- That's great.

105
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:17,623
Everybody takes the subway
in New York.

106
00:05:18,045 --> 00:05:21,302
It's fast, it's efficient,
gets you there on time.

107
00:05:22,135 --> 00:05:23,431
It's a way to... Okay.

108
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,133
There's a guy pooping in
a cardboard box down there.

109
00:05:27,145 --> 00:05:29,823
This is the world-famous
Rockefeller Center.

110
00:05:29,948 --> 00:05:31,933
Founded  of course,
by Theodore Rockefeller.

111
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,592
This is the skating rink.

112
00:05:34,185 --> 00:05:36,973
And I think they Rangers,
practice there sometimes.

113
00:05:37,608 --> 00:05:40,220
And, it's... that's Tina Fey.

114
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:42,902
That's Tina Fey
from Saturday Night Live.

115
00:05:44,926 --> 00:05:46,541
Hello, hello. Hi.

116
00:05:46,985 --> 00:05:48,363
Oh, I'm s... I'm sorry.

117
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:50,553
I thought you were... okay.

118
00:05:50,587 --> 00:05:51,563
I thought that was...

119
00:05:52,635 --> 00:05:55,093
<i>She looked like...
she looked a lot like Tina Fey.</i>

120
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:59,913
Hello, hello. I thought that was
Tina Fey, but it wasn't. So.

121
00:06:00,586 --> 00:06:02,053
Are you serious ?

122
00:06:02,385 --> 00:06:03,413
He was here ?

123
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:05,481
When ? When I was talking to
the fake Tina Fey ?

124
00:06:05,516 --> 00:06:06,761
Come on ! No, are you s...

125
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:13,350
Hello, Angela. Did you hear ?

126
00:06:13,385 --> 00:06:14,791
Somebody totally rocked the house 

127
00:06:14,827 --> 00:06:16,841
and got me the best present
I've ever gotten.

128
00:06:16,906 --> 00:06:17,900
Really ?

129
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:19,510
I wouldn't know anything
about that.

130
00:06:19,555 --> 00:06:22,422
- But I'm glad you enjoyed it.
- Oh, I did. I did.

131
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:24,992
I didn't get anything
for Valentine's Day.

132
00:06:25,028 --> 00:06:27,073
Oh, I bet you will before
the day is over.

133
00:06:27,148 --> 00:06:30,032
Really ? Well, I hope I do.

134
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,973
<i>I would love to live
in New York some day.</i>

135
00:06:40,007 --> 00:06:43,221
<i>It's a big dream of mine.
Work corporate, with Jan.</i>

136
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:47,191
<i>It'd  be awesome.
Go to Broadway shows, eat hotdogs.</i>

137
00:06:47,238 --> 00:06:49,671
<i>Scranton is great, but New York...</i>

138
00:06:50,248 --> 00:06:52,303
<i>is like Scranton on acid.</i>

139
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,553
<i>No, on speed. Nah.</i>

140
00:06:55,927 --> 00:06:57,102
<i>On steroids.</i>

141
00:06:57,935 --> 00:07:00,820
Okay. Um, I think...

142
00:07:02,018 --> 00:07:03,593
that's either the Hudson or the East.

143
00:07:03,675 --> 00:07:06,270
So, we're back...
should be back this way.

144
00:07:09,173 --> 00:07:11,656
<i>There is a lot of pressure
on me right now.</i>

145
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:14,080
<i>It's like Michael Jordan
in the NBA finals,</i>

146
00:07:14,366 --> 00:07:17,216
<i>or like
Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf.</i>

147
00:07:17,299 --> 00:07:19,580
<i>And this presentation
is Desert Storm.</i>

148
00:07:19,908 --> 00:07:21,623
And soon as it's over,

149
00:07:21,758 --> 00:07:24,103
we will not have to deal
with those Iraqis anymore.

150
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:25,903
Let's do it.

151
00:07:29,256 --> 00:07:31,080
No, that's alright.
Spend the money on her

152
00:07:31,138 --> 00:07:32,913
instead of giving it to us.
That's fine.

153
00:07:33,575 --> 00:07:35,713
No, I didn't even have
a seat for you anyway.

154
00:07:36,276 --> 00:07:37,270
Yeah.

155
00:07:39,147 --> 00:07:40,100
All right, man.

156
00:07:40,387 --> 00:07:41,710
Okay, have a good night. Bye.

157
00:07:52,676 --> 00:07:53,673
Phyllis Lapin ?

158
00:07:53,735 --> 00:07:55,200
- Holy God.
- It's from Bob.

159
00:07:56,028 --> 00:07:57,883
Man, that thing's bigger than I am.

160
00:07:57,995 --> 00:08:00,070
- No, it's not.
- Oh, zip it.

161
00:08:00,297 --> 00:08:02,001
There they are. What's up ?

162
00:08:02,035 --> 00:08:03,253
-Hey.
- Hey, hey.

163
00:08:03,288 --> 00:08:05,643
- Michael Scott.
- Josh Porter. High five.

164
00:08:08,835 --> 00:08:11,350
- You know Dan Gordon from Buffalo.
- Yeah, how you doing ?

165
00:08:11,396 --> 00:08:13,440
Nobody needs to introduce this guy.
Craigers.

166
00:08:13,955 --> 00:08:15,943
- What's up, buddy ?
- You have been kicked out

167
00:08:15,975 --> 00:08:17,223
of every strip club in Albany.

168
00:08:17,255 --> 00:08:18,690
- Is that true ?
- Guilty, yeah.

169
00:08:19,288 --> 00:08:20,930
So what's going on,
what did I miss ?

170
00:08:20,998 --> 00:08:23,063
No much. They're,
I guess running late upstairs.

171
00:08:23,097 --> 00:08:25,340
So we're just waiting
for the presentation.

172
00:08:25,486 --> 00:08:27,331
Cool. Good. Good. Good.

173
00:08:27,398 --> 00:08:29,941
Give us some time
to catch up and...

174
00:08:34,697 --> 00:08:36,482
Pam, hi. How you doing ? Good.

175
00:08:36,535 --> 00:08:38,271
Listen, may I speak with you...

176
00:08:39,548 --> 00:08:40,692
privately ?

177
00:08:40,748 --> 00:08:43,212
You can't fire me, Dwight.
Just 'cause Michael's not here.

178
00:08:43,248 --> 00:08:44,670
No, Pam, just,

179
00:08:45,585 --> 00:08:46,673
Just...

180
00:08:47,418 --> 00:08:48,442
Please.

181
00:08:48,718 --> 00:08:51,570
You need to get something
for your... girlfriend ?

182
00:08:51,606 --> 00:08:52,590
Girlfriend. Yes.

183
00:08:52,646 --> 00:08:55,300
And the reason I didn't get
anything for this particular person,

184
00:08:55,358 --> 00:08:56,792
who shall remain nameless,

185
00:08:57,115 --> 00:08:59,341
is that she's not really
the kind of person

186
00:08:59,387 --> 00:09:01,513
you'd think would be
in to Valentine's Day.

187
00:09:02,185 --> 00:09:04,611
- She's kind of...
- Tightly wound ?

188
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:07,932
Exactly.

189
00:09:08,545 --> 00:09:12,221
Okay. Well, sometimes the gift is
really about the gesture,

190
00:09:12,257 --> 00:09:15,211
you know, like what it means
instead of what it is.

191
00:09:15,408 --> 00:09:17,792
You mean, like a ham ?

192
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,751
No. Not like a ham.

193
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:25,042
It's about doing something,

194
00:09:25,337 --> 00:09:27,990
so that the person knows
that you really care about her.

195
00:09:28,028 --> 00:09:29,810
- Okay, I get it.
- That you remember her.

196
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,203
That's great. Okay, shut up.
I know exactly what to do.

197
00:09:35,795 --> 00:09:37,671
How about you, Craig ?
Did you lose anyone ?

198
00:09:37,705 --> 00:09:40,000
Oh, man. Jan called me
in September.

199
00:09:40,057 --> 00:09:41,861
And she's like,
you gotta fire four people.

200
00:09:41,918 --> 00:09:43,551
And I was just like, what ?
You know.

201
00:09:45,936 --> 00:09:48,220
- Did you ?
- No, I just ignored her.

202
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,410
She's the worst.

203
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:51,002
Well, she's our boss.

204
00:09:51,305 --> 00:09:53,513
She ain't my boss, dude.
I don't work for that bitch.

205
00:09:53,546 --> 00:09:55,062
Hey, come on.

206
00:09:55,075 --> 00:09:56,521
- You know, that's not...
- What ?

207
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:57,931
- Just cool it.
- You like Jan ?

208
00:09:58,045 --> 00:09:59,043
How can you like Jan ?

209
00:09:59,088 --> 00:10:00,620
Maybe because she's my girlfriend.

210
00:10:03,615 --> 00:10:05,831
Was, or not my girlfriend.
She's...

211
00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:08,992
- we hooked up and...
- You hooked up with Jan ?

212
00:10:09,028 --> 00:10:10,842
That was just, you know,
months ago.

213
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,722
It was just once.
God, it's just stupid.

214
00:10:13,775 --> 00:10:15,530
Just... forget it.

215
00:10:16,277 --> 00:10:18,330
- Yeah, let's change the subject.
- Yeah, yeah.

216
00:10:21,378 --> 00:10:22,713
I don't know what he's thinking,

217
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,231
but I would just be so psyched
if we just dated forever.

218
00:10:25,327 --> 00:10:27,251
Well, take it slow.

219
00:10:28,036 --> 00:10:30,060
'Cause it seems like
a lot of the time,

220
00:10:30,525 --> 00:10:31,893
things like that need to...

221
00:10:35,038 --> 00:10:36,220
Soda.

222
00:10:36,486 --> 00:10:37,492
Cool.

223
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:44,560
Hey, so do you want to do
something tonight ?

224
00:10:44,615 --> 00:10:47,320
Oh, no, not while I'm here.

225
00:10:47,466 --> 00:10:49,690
I mean, I know that
it's Valentine's Day or whatever,

226
00:10:49,725 --> 00:10:53,030
but there's totally no pressure
at all of any kind, whatsoever.

227
00:10:53,238 --> 00:10:54,342
- So...
- I can't tonight.

228
00:10:54,377 --> 00:10:55,760
I have plans with my friends.

229
00:10:56,647 --> 00:10:57,431
Okay.

230
00:10:57,877 --> 00:10:59,211
- That's cool. I...
- Okay.

231
00:10:59,437 --> 00:11:01,181
- I completely understand.
- Cool.

232
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:02,811
Okay.

233
00:11:23,987 --> 00:11:26,143
- Josh Porter, Stanford.
- Nice to meet you.

234
00:11:26,178 --> 00:11:27,543
And  Michael Scott, Scranton.

235
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,300
- Nice to meet you.
- Ditto.

236
00:11:29,905 --> 00:11:32,141
- How are you, Jan ?
- Fine, Michael, thank you.

237
00:11:32,895 --> 00:11:35,021
Okay, so we are in the process

238
00:11:35,075 --> 00:11:38,052
of doing a complete review of
the company's financial strength.

239
00:11:38,277 --> 00:11:39,541
All I'd like to do today...

240
00:11:39,607 --> 00:11:41,370
<i>Nervous ? No, I'm not nervous.</i>

241
00:11:41,548 --> 00:11:42,962
Well, I mean, I guess I'd be lying

242
00:11:43,026 --> 00:11:44,792
if I didn't say
I was a little nervous.

243
00:11:44,858 --> 00:11:46,931
The new CFO is judging me
on this too.

244
00:11:46,985 --> 00:11:48,840
And, well, it is Michael. So...

245
00:11:50,706 --> 00:11:52,051
yeah, I'm very nervous.

246
00:11:52,418 --> 00:11:57,373
So with the 12 new local accounts,
we had a total of 4% organic growth.

247
00:11:57,438 --> 00:11:59,972
Which was just above
our pre-year targets.

248
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,892
- Thanks very much.
- Thank you.

249
00:12:02,387 --> 00:12:03,973
Okay, Michael.

250
00:12:10,466 --> 00:12:11,870
What is a business ?

251
00:12:12,437 --> 00:12:16,610
Is it a collection of numbers
and sales reports ?

252
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:21,931
Sure. But as you know,
David and Jan, it is much more.

253
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:44,252
<i>Life moves a little slower
in Scranton, Pennsylvania.</i>

254
00:12:44,676 --> 00:12:46,590
<i>And that's the way we like it.</i>

255
00:12:47,006 --> 00:12:49,310
<i>'Cause at Dunder Mifflin Scranton,</i>

256
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:51,963
<i>we're not just
in the paper business.</i>

257
00:12:52,226 --> 00:12:54,523
<i>We're in the people business.</i>

258
00:12:55,266 --> 00:12:59,352
<i>Let's meet some of the folks
who make Scranton branch so special.</i>

259
00:13:00,136 --> 00:13:04,510
<i>This is Stanley Hudson,
one of our talented salesmen.</i>

260
00:13:04,956 --> 00:13:07,351
<i>An African-American
father of two...</i>

261
00:13:07,447 --> 00:13:11,181
<i>Stanley's dedication is no doubt one
of the hallmarks of the foundation</i>

262
00:13:11,236 --> 00:13:14,211
<i>of the business we're hoping
to build our basis on.</i>

263
00:13:16,135 --> 00:13:18,232
Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage
around the office,

264
00:13:18,285 --> 00:13:20,671
edited it together on my Mac.

265
00:13:20,955 --> 00:13:23,112
Was thinking about entering it
in some festivals.

266
00:13:23,277 --> 00:13:25,711
Probably won't.
You know, not what this is about.

267
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:29,552
<i>And finally, Pam Beesly.</i>

268
00:13:29,865 --> 00:13:31,820
<i>Look at her. Look how cute.</i>

269
00:13:32,505 --> 00:13:34,041
<i>Not bad at all.</i>

270
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:39,661
<i>As the receptionist, Pam is truly
the gateway to our world.</i>

271
00:13:40,438 --> 00:13:42,620
<i>Well, I hope this gave you</i>

272
00:13:42,676 --> 00:13:46,333
<i>a little taste of what life is like
here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton.</i>

273
00:13:46,996 --> 00:13:49,742
<i>What it's like to walk
a mile in Oscar's shoes.</i>

274
00:13:50,186 --> 00:13:51,912
<i>Or try on Phyllis' pants.</i>

275
00:13:52,735 --> 00:13:54,983
<i>Next time you're in town,
give us a call.</i>

276
00:13:55,566 --> 00:13:56,840
<i>Stop on by.</i>

277
00:13:56,955 --> 00:13:58,891
<i>I'm sure you'll be greeted
by a big smile</i>

278
00:13:58,946 --> 00:14:00,361
<i>and a "How you doing, pal ?"</i>

279
00:14:00,865 --> 00:14:03,400
<i>Maybe even one of
Angela's famous brownies.</i>

280
00:14:03,848 --> 00:14:06,281
<i>And you'll know that you're home.</i>

281
00:14:16,985 --> 00:14:17,951
<i>Great Scott !</i> 

282
00:14:20,165 --> 00:14:21,243
Questions ?

283
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:29,110
Okay, okay, thank you, Michael.
That was great.

284
00:14:29,206 --> 00:14:30,472
Yes, thank you.

285
00:14:30,587 --> 00:14:32,863
But, for right now, what I'd really
like to know about

286
00:14:32,898 --> 00:14:34,111
is the branch's performance.

287
00:14:35,046 --> 00:14:37,200
So do you have
that information as well ?

288
00:14:38,636 --> 00:14:41,732
Yes, absolutely, David.

289
00:14:42,016 --> 00:14:43,420
Get that for you. I...

290
00:14:49,206 --> 00:14:50,753
-  Can you sign ?
- Yeah.

291
00:14:52,176 --> 00:14:53,412
Oscar.

292
00:14:53,576 --> 00:14:55,523
- Nothing for me ?
- Join the club.

293
00:14:59,627 --> 00:15:01,483
- Who's it from ?
- My mom.

294
00:15:14,108 --> 00:15:17,233
It's frustrating 'cause
we'd be so perfect together.

295
00:15:18,388 --> 00:15:20,491
You know what ?
Here's the deal, Kelly.

296
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:23,061
It would be really nice
if he was into you, right ?

297
00:15:23,097 --> 00:15:25,031
It would be great. But he isn't.

298
00:15:25,836 --> 00:15:27,681
- You know.
- Yeah, but it would be so great

299
00:15:27,736 --> 00:15:29,452
- if he was...
- Well, he's not, though.

300
00:15:29,488 --> 00:15:30,681
So you just gotta suck it up.

301
00:15:30,715 --> 00:15:33,000
You just gotta move on.
Try to have some fun.

302
00:15:33,805 --> 00:15:35,600
Come to my poker game tonight.

303
00:15:35,827 --> 00:15:36,993
Okay, cool.

304
00:15:37,777 --> 00:15:39,503
Is it okay if I invite Ryan ?

305
00:15:47,135 --> 00:15:48,963
And that about does it. Thank you.

306
00:15:49,456 --> 00:15:50,481
Okay.

307
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:52,121
Craig.

308
00:15:52,955 --> 00:15:54,721
Yeah, here's the deal.

309
00:15:55,286 --> 00:15:57,821
I did not understand
this was supposed to be a...

310
00:15:58,156 --> 00:16:00,833
full on, like, report or whatnot.

311
00:16:01,616 --> 00:16:05,792
I'm sorry, what did you think
"financial presentation" meant ?

312
00:16:05,915 --> 00:16:07,151
I was under the impression

313
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:10,071
this was more of, like,
a meet-and-greet type of deal.

314
00:16:10,717 --> 00:16:14,610
So, does that mean that you don't
have the numbers on your branch ?

315
00:16:14,735 --> 00:16:16,102
That is correct, yes.

316
00:16:16,618 --> 00:16:18,993
Craig, you realize that we are trying

317
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:21,672
to decide whether drastic steps
need to be taken.

318
00:16:21,755 --> 00:16:23,231
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't know.

319
00:16:23,306 --> 00:16:26,743
Well, the point is that this doesn't
exactly bode well for your branch.

320
00:16:26,828 --> 00:16:28,132
Oh, man. You know what ?

321
00:16:28,245 --> 00:16:31,302
Michael made that stupid movie.
He doesn't get in any trouble.

322
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:33,631
Maybe I should've slept
with you too.

323
00:16:39,467 --> 00:16:40,641
- Okay, okay.
- No, no, no.

324
00:16:40,717 --> 00:16:42,383
- All right.
- I'm not, I just...

325
00:16:43,495 --> 00:16:45,901
I just don't know what to do
anymore, Michael.

326
00:16:45,967 --> 00:16:47,942
I mean, I'm probably
going to get fired.

327
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:49,793
- No, you're not.
- Yeah, I...

328
00:16:49,957 --> 00:16:52,371
Michael, the CFO thinks
that we slept together.

329
00:16:52,597 --> 00:16:55,031
Don't you understand ?
People get fired for much less.

330
00:16:55,196 --> 00:16:59,122
And I just can't believe
that you told everybody.

331
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:00,951
And we didn't even sleep together !

332
00:17:01,077 --> 00:17:03,882
Technically, we fell asleep
in the same bed.

333
00:17:03,948 --> 00:17:05,172
- So...
- Oh, God.

334
00:17:05,676 --> 00:17:09,302
Michael, it was months ago.
It was once. It's over.

335
00:17:11,616 --> 00:17:12,992
Do you understand ?

336
00:17:14,876 --> 00:17:17,100
Yes. I'm sorry.

337
00:17:19,036 --> 00:17:23,313
I'll, fix this. I'll talk to him.
I'll talk to David.

338
00:17:24,355 --> 00:17:26,480
Surely, you cannot be serious.

339
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:29,421
I am serious,
and don't call me Shirley.

340
00:17:29,866 --> 00:17:30,982
Airplane.

341
00:17:40,007 --> 00:17:42,043
<i>Women, are like wolves.</i>

342
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,653
<i>If you want a wolf,
you have to trap it.</i>

343
00:17:45,595 --> 00:17:46,931
<i>You have to snare it.</i>

344
00:17:48,085 --> 00:17:49,470
<i>And then you have to tame it.</i>

345
00:17:49,748 --> 00:17:51,983
Keep it happy.
Care for it. Feed it.

346
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:55,203
Lovingly, the way an animal
deserves to be loved.

347
00:17:57,405 --> 00:17:59,731
And my animal deserves
a lot of loving.

348
00:18:04,915 --> 00:18:06,243
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

349
00:18:06,807 --> 00:18:09,152
- You almost ready to go ?
- I guess, yeah.

350
00:18:10,427 --> 00:18:11,933
- What's wrong ?
- Nothing.

351
00:18:12,005 --> 00:18:14,483
It's just that I had to sit here
all day while Phyllis got,

352
00:18:14,525 --> 00:18:16,382
like, an entire garden
delivered to her.

353
00:18:17,117 --> 00:18:18,551
What, you're mad at me ?

354
00:18:19,405 --> 00:18:21,481
I mean, I know that
we said no big gifts,

355
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:24,620
but I was kind of hoping you'd get
me something for Valentine's Day.

356
00:18:24,747 --> 00:18:26,900
Well, Valentine's Day isn't over.

357
00:18:27,427 --> 00:18:31,242
Let's get you home, and you are
gonna get the best sex of your life.

358
00:18:34,256 --> 00:18:36,300
You understand this is 
a very serious situation.

359
00:18:36,357 --> 00:18:38,132
No, no, no. Yes, I... Okay, well...

360
00:18:38,246 --> 00:18:40,152
All right, here's the deal.
This is my fault.

361
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:42,261
This is totally on me.
Before you guys came in,

362
00:18:42,328 --> 00:18:44,702
I was talking to the guys,
we were all chatting.

363
00:18:44,787 --> 00:18:46,942
And I made a joke.

364
00:18:47,057 --> 00:18:48,162
A really dumb joke.

365
00:18:48,216 --> 00:18:50,310
And Craig the idiot
took it seriously.

366
00:18:50,675 --> 00:18:53,411
-  You made a joke ?
- I did. It was stupid.

367
00:18:53,478 --> 00:18:55,302
And Craig, you saw him,

368
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,291
he's not the sharpest tool
in the shed.

369
00:18:57,997 --> 00:18:59,260
Although, he is a tool.

370
00:19:00,537 --> 00:19:02,141
Well, I don't need
to explain to you

371
00:19:02,206 --> 00:19:04,693
that even a joke about sexual
relations with your boss...

372
00:19:04,746 --> 00:19:06,781
I know, it was borderline at best.

373
00:19:06,848 --> 00:19:10,730
And... and Jan
is a fantastic executive

374
00:19:10,878 --> 00:19:12,752
and has all the integrity
in the world.

375
00:19:12,796 --> 00:19:16,313
And, I'm really sorry.

376
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:18,021
It'll never happen again.

377
00:19:22,608 --> 00:19:25,000
It's fine. Let's just...
just forget it.

378
00:19:26,007 --> 00:19:27,222
Good.

379
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:39,812
- Heading out ?
- Yeah.

380
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:44,272
All right, Beesly.
Hey, Happy Valentine's Day.

381
00:19:45,657 --> 00:19:46,670
Bye.

382
00:19:51,245 --> 00:19:53,363
- Good night, Pam.
- Night, Phyllis.

383
00:20:00,777 --> 00:20:02,581
Thank you again, for that, really.

384
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:04,262
- It was very nice.
- No big deal.

385
00:20:04,347 --> 00:20:07,063
- Really, sorry again.
- Oh, no. It's... it's okay.

386
00:20:07,117 --> 00:20:08,421
It's okay.

387
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:11,570
So... Happy Valentine's Day.

388
00:20:11,695 --> 00:20:13,432
Yeah, Happy Valentine's Day.

389
00:20:33,307 --> 00:20:35,762
Oi vey...schmear.

<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:01,875
Let's think this through.

2
00:00:02,074 --> 00:00:05,904
If we ask corporate for that, then...

3
00:00:06,113 --> 00:00:10,880
They are either gonna say yes... or no.

4
00:00:11,157 --> 00:00:12,210
Could go either way.

5
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:15,052
We don't know what
they are going to say.

6
00:00:15,092 --> 00:00:17,246
- Think it through !
- Have to think it through.

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,123
Because if they say no...

8
00:00:22,353 --> 00:00:23,170
Can we not ?

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,314
No, yes we have to.
You know why ?

10
00:00:25,365 --> 00:00:27,450
Cause I don't like to be
cooped up in that office.

11
00:00:27,483 --> 00:00:29,936
In that box all day long.
Heisman !

12
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:33,050
Because I need to think. Okay, Jim ?

13
00:00:33,226 --> 00:00:35,356
Oh, Kevin !

14
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:41,121
Nice catch.

15
00:00:41,217 --> 00:00:42,620
Oscar !

16
00:00:43,556 --> 00:00:44,613
Intercepted. Right here. 

17
00:00:44,656 --> 00:00:46,221
- Right or the left.
- Give it to me.

18
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:48,321
Phyllis, give me the ball.
Okay, give me the ball.

19
00:00:48,368 --> 00:00:50,430
You guys...Creed. Give me the ball.
Right now.

20
00:00:50,547 --> 00:00:52,311
- Give it to me.
- Ryan.

21
00:00:54,098 --> 00:00:55,980
Fumble ! Yeah !

22
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:00,801
All right, hey, Dwight !

23
00:01:09,425 --> 00:01:12,422
- You all right, Ryan ?
-  Yeah.

24
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:16,082
Pam !

25
00:01:38,646 --> 00:01:41,550
Episode 217 - Season 2
DWIGHT'S SPEECH

26
00:01:41,855 --> 00:01:44,680
Script: Nikki (twiztv.com)
Synchronisation: Catch-22 Team

27
00:01:44,785 --> 00:01:47,861
http://pmag.f2o.org/theofficeus/
www.forom.com

28
00:01:50,345 --> 00:01:53,071
They're having a sale on TiVo.

29
00:01:53,275 --> 00:01:56,151
Maybe I should get a TiVo.

30
00:01:56,655 --> 00:01:59,533
DVD burner.
Maybe I should get one of those.

31
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:02,632
You are so lucky, Jim.

32
00:02:02,775 --> 00:02:05,481
You are so lucky you
don't have this problem.

33
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,032
What was the ninth place prize again ?

34
00:02:09,206 --> 00:02:11,531
A loaf of bread ?

35
00:02:11,657 --> 00:02:13,612
Cojino's pizza.

36
00:02:13,887 --> 00:02:16,510
Great. Tasty terrific pizza.

37
00:02:17,355 --> 00:02:20,712
Question, do their pizza play DVDs ?

38
00:02:22,735 --> 00:02:25,472
<i>Dwight was the top salesman
of the year at our company.</i>

39
00:02:25,996 --> 00:02:29,802
He wins a little prize money and
gets honored at some convention

40
00:02:30,538 --> 00:02:35,130
It is literally the highest possible
honor that a Northeastern, Pennsylvania;

41
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:38,831
based, mid-sized, paper company,
regional salesman, can attain. So...

42
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:43,981
- What did I do to deserve this ?
- Are you sad that Dwight beat you ?

43
00:02:44,176 --> 00:02:45,993
- No.
- Are you gonna cry, Jim ?

44
00:02:46,128 --> 00:02:49,023
- Do you need a tissue ?
- I heard that you got a wedding dress.

45
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:53,000
- Do you have pictures ?
-Yeah. I'll show 'em to you later.

46
00:02:53,776 --> 00:02:56,250
I should get back.

47
00:02:56,466 --> 00:02:58,100
- Talk to you guys later.
- Okay, cool.

48
00:02:58,295 --> 00:03:00,173
I have a ton of stuff
to do for the wedding.

49
00:03:00,205 --> 00:03:02,051
And I have to do it in the office.

50
00:03:02,128 --> 00:03:04,180
And that can be kind of awkward.

51
00:03:04,357 --> 00:03:09,203
Just because people, can get all
weird about wedding stuff.

52
00:03:09,588 --> 00:03:12,482
I just don't want to offend...

53
00:03:12,638 --> 00:03:15,413
Angela. Or someone.

54
00:03:20,126 --> 00:03:23,201
- That's what she said.
- I don't get it.

55
00:03:23,798 --> 00:03:26,030
Grapes, seductive.

56
00:03:26,308 --> 00:03:28,550
So, you ready for the big
speech this afternoon ?

57
00:03:28,726 --> 00:03:31,472
Well, it's not really a big speech.
You're still coming, right ?

58
00:03:32,026 --> 00:03:34,202
Abso-fruitly.

59
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:36,552
Fruit, grapes. Nailed the joke.
Matter of time.

60
00:03:36,858 --> 00:03:40,051
And yes, it is a big speech.
Biggest of your life.

61
00:03:41,506 --> 00:03:43,581
Speaker at the sales convention.

62
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:46,772
Been there, done that.
Went there again, did it again.

63
00:03:47,106 --> 00:03:50,281
Two years in a row. Consecutive.

64
00:03:51,537 --> 00:03:55,651
I just I miss the feeling of knowing
that you did a good job.

65
00:03:55,975 --> 00:03:57,892
Because somebody
gives you proof of it.

66
00:03:57,966 --> 00:04:01,272
<i>Sir, you're awesome.
Here's a plaque.</i>

67
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:04,521
<i>What, a whole year has gone by,
and you need more proof ?</i>

68
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:05,952
<i>Here's a certificate.</i>

69
00:04:06,135 --> 00:04:08,032
They stopped making
plaques that year.

70
00:04:08,575 --> 00:04:11,653
What if I give a really
long extended thank you ?

71
00:04:11,736 --> 00:04:14,873
For instance, thank you, Mr. Blank.

72
00:04:15,337 --> 00:04:18,621
- Thank you, very, very...
- That would look terrible.

73
00:04:18,715 --> 00:04:21,873
These are mostly salesmen, and
salesmen expect to be entertained.

74
00:04:21,965 --> 00:04:23,713
And  you are the main act.

75
00:04:23,815 --> 00:04:27,360
When I was in the sixth grade, I was a
finalist in our school spelling bee.

76
00:04:27,765 --> 00:04:30,593
It was me against Raj Patel.

77
00:04:30,998 --> 00:04:34,322
And I misspelled,
in front of the entire school.

78
00:04:35,078 --> 00:04:37,001
The word "failure".

79
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:38,351
I can't do this.

80
00:04:38,547 --> 00:04:40,381
That's because you're
incapable of doing it.

81
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,852
Because you don't know how.
Because you have no skills.

82
00:04:45,175 --> 00:04:47,602
Dwight, there's no way
I can possibly teach you,

83
00:04:47,668 --> 00:04:50,170
you need to know about
public speaking by speech time.

84
00:04:50,268 --> 00:04:51,073
Okay.

85
00:04:51,177 --> 00:04:55,251
But, I can teach you enough so that
you don't embarrass me or the company.

86
00:04:55,366 --> 00:04:57,992
Okay, deal. I'll do whatever you say.
No questions asked.

87
00:04:58,126 --> 00:05:00,151
Well, if you have a question,
you should ask me.

88
00:05:00,195 --> 00:05:01,310
I'll try to think of one...

89
00:05:01,347 --> 00:05:03,473
Don't-don't try to think of
a question to humor me.

90
00:05:03,506 --> 00:05:04,890
Just try not to be such an idiot.

91
00:05:05,015 --> 00:05:07,813
Is that an insult or is that part
of the public speaking advice ?

92
00:05:10,197 --> 00:05:11,200
Insult.

93
00:05:13,445 --> 00:05:16,300
<i>Mom, I'm sorry. I know you and dad
are chipping in for the wedding.</i>

94
00:05:16,346 --> 00:05:18,240
But I do not want
orange invitations.

95
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:21,601
Yes.

96
00:05:22,346 --> 00:05:24,121
<i>Well, if you really want...</i>

97
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,491
Hi, yeah, can I talk to one
of your travel agents ?

98
00:05:26,645 --> 00:05:28,342
I'm gonna take a trip.

99
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:30,902
I'm gonna get out of town for a while.

100
00:05:31,476 --> 00:05:33,353
And go someplace...

101
00:05:33,778 --> 00:05:35,220
Not here.

102
00:05:35,826 --> 00:05:37,673
Where do I want to go ?

103
00:05:38,767 --> 00:05:40,861
That is an excellent question.

104
00:05:40,996 --> 00:05:43,743
<i>And one I probably should have
thought about before I called you.</i>

105
00:05:46,026 --> 00:05:49,101
<i>I get here early every morning
so I can set the thermostat.</i>

106
00:05:49,776 --> 00:05:52,521
I like it a little cooler,
around 66 degrees.

107
00:05:52,848 --> 00:05:54,441
I'm more productive.

108
00:05:54,475 --> 00:05:57,602
<i>Maybe some people don't
like it as cold as I do.</i>

109
00:05:58,197 --> 00:05:59,420
But I don't care.

110
00:05:59,517 --> 00:06:03,473
But  seriously, what's the difference
between a salesman and a saleswoman ?

111
00:06:03,695 --> 00:06:05,852
- A saleswoman has a vagina.
- It's a joke, Dwight.

112
00:06:05,897 --> 00:06:07,700
- It's not a sex ed class.
- But I'm right.

113
00:06:07,727 --> 00:06:10,482
Yeah, you're right about the difference
between a man and a woman.

114
00:06:10,515 --> 00:06:12,710
But not about the punchline
to the joke, all right ?

115
00:06:12,738 --> 00:06:16,573
The difference between a salesman
and a saleswoman is boobs.

116
00:06:17,348 --> 00:06:19,622
Hey, do you remember
the speeches that you gave ?

117
00:06:19,648 --> 00:06:20,942
I do. Both of them.

118
00:06:20,975 --> 00:06:23,802
- Could I have a copy of one of them?
- No, no, they would remember.

119
00:06:23,828 --> 00:06:25,782
Look, it doesn't matter what you say.

120
00:06:25,987 --> 00:06:28,883
it just matters that you're saying
something that people care about.

121
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:32,013
Yeah? All right, here we go.
Watch this.

122
00:06:32,137 --> 00:06:34,341
Attention everybody !
Attention please.

123
00:06:34,467 --> 00:06:37,173
I have some very great
news from corporate.

124
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:39,803
We had a wonderful quarter,
and as a result,

125
00:06:39,908 --> 00:06:43,031
all of you are getting
bonuses for $1,000.

126
00:06:43,238 --> 00:06:45,441
- Yeah ! 
- Congratulations.

127
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,462
You see that ?

128
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,662
You see how they responded to me ?
In that moment, I had them.

129
00:06:55,835 --> 00:06:59,012
- That is so great about the bonus !
- No, no. It's not true.

130
00:06:59,358 --> 00:07:02,991
I was just talking.
So, just go out there and say anything.

131
00:07:03,415 --> 00:07:05,390
They'll eat it up,
they're a great audience.

132
00:07:05,636 --> 00:07:08,991
Go ahead, get the wallpaper.
Wallpaper the ceiling if you want.

133
00:07:09,216 --> 00:07:12,661
Excuse me ?
May I have your attention please ?

134
00:07:12,835 --> 00:07:15,961
There has been an accident on 84 West.

135
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:19,242
Cars have skidded off the
road into the safety railing.

136
00:07:19,485 --> 00:07:22,933
Several  cars have flipped.
There is broken glass everywhere.

137
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:24,683
Several people are injured.

138
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:28,111
Do we know anyone who
was injured in the accident ?

139
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,172
Brad Pitt.

140
00:07:32,088 --> 00:07:33,991
Also, there will be no bonuses.

141
00:07:34,136 --> 00:07:36,660
- Why would this affect our bonuses ?
- They're unrelated.

142
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,033
Is Brad okay ?

143
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:39,870
He will never act again.

144
00:07:40,123 --> 00:07:42,056
Also, this branch is closing.

145
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,710
What the hell is going on here ?

146
00:07:43,766 --> 00:07:45,236
- Are we out of jobs ?
- Yes.

147
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:48,001
This is karma for what he
did to Jennifer Anniston.

148
00:07:48,137 --> 00:07:49,511
He's kidding. Dwight was kidding.

149
00:07:49,615 --> 00:07:52,260
And I don't know why
because it wasn't funny.

150
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:54,863
And it was just horrible.

151
00:07:55,088 --> 00:07:56,213
- Michael ?
- Yeah ?

152
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,760
You said we were getting bonuses.

153
00:07:57,797 --> 00:07:59,810
All right. Everybody in
the conference room now.

154
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:01,432
Let's go ! Let's do it.

155
00:08:01,587 --> 00:08:03,290
<i>Cancel the wallpaper</i>

156
00:08:03,335 --> 00:08:05,132
As your leader and your friend,

157
00:08:05,237 --> 00:08:09,511
I sort of demand that you can
all speak in public as I can.

158
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:11,433
And did, twice.

159
00:08:11,637 --> 00:08:13,961
You saw the plaque, right ?

160
00:08:14,408 --> 00:08:17,561
All right, we're all gonna go around the
room and we're going to make toasts.

161
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:21,263
And that way we will overcome
or fear of public speaking.

162
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:22,780
- You mean toastmasters ?
- Pam !

163
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:25,730
I'm public speaking.
Stop public interrupting me.

164
00:08:26,018 --> 00:08:29,682
Actually, this would be good
practice for your wedding toast.

165
00:08:30,565 --> 00:08:34,812
Yeah, the bride doesn't really do,
have you ever been to a wedding ?

166
00:08:35,207 --> 00:08:36,760
- Can I go ?
- Yes

167
00:08:36,888 --> 00:08:39,111
Good. Jim taking the initiative.

168
00:08:40,358 --> 00:08:43,681
So, I am going on a trip.

169
00:08:44,155 --> 00:08:46,083
But I'm not really sure
where I'm going yet.

170
00:08:46,128 --> 00:08:47,261
It'a kinda open ended.

171
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:49,913
So I was hoping maybe you guys
would have some suggestions.

172
00:08:50,436 --> 00:08:52,431
You should go to Hedonism.

173
00:08:52,618 --> 00:08:55,113
- What is that ?
- It's like Club Med.

174
00:08:55,587 --> 00:08:58,162
But everything is naked.

175
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:01,182
I was thinking more like Europe.
Or something like that.

176
00:09:01,285 --> 00:09:03,312
But good second choice.

177
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,382
Been to Amsterdam.

178
00:09:05,605 --> 00:09:07,133
Okay, you know what ?

179
00:09:07,235 --> 00:09:09,942
That's not a toast.
You're not standing up.

180
00:09:11,256 --> 00:09:13,731
- To Amsterdam.
-  When did you go there ?

181
00:09:15,335 --> 00:09:16,461
After my divorce.

182
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:18,240
Really? For like, how long ?

183
00:09:18,465 --> 00:09:21,412
About a week or...maybe or month.

184
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:23,383
- I can't
- Jimmy, listen to me

185
00:09:23,557 --> 00:09:26,080
You do not want to go
to Amsterdam, trust me.

186
00:09:26,258 --> 00:09:29,160
- Where do I wanna go ?
- I'd send you to Hong Kong.

187
00:09:29,588 --> 00:09:31,311
I'd like to say hi to
my friends in China.

188
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:35,361
Wode Zhongguode Pengyou Nihao.

189
00:09:36,415 --> 00:09:38,182
Okay. Dwight.

190
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:43,043
Show us what you have learned today.

191
00:09:46,516 --> 00:09:49,093
Good morning, Vietnam !

192
00:09:56,485 --> 00:09:59,081
Okay, you know what ?
This isn't working.

193
00:09:59,287 --> 00:10:02,143
Because, I'm not
nervous in front of them.

194
00:10:02,337 --> 00:10:05,130
- They're my subordinates.
- No, we're not.

195
00:10:05,286 --> 00:10:07,913
Yes, you are. I am the
assistant regional manager.

196
00:10:08,115 --> 00:10:10,953
- Which means absolutely nothing.
- Michael, can you explain ?

197
00:10:11,017 --> 00:10:14,220
- Well, it's mostly made up. So...

198
00:10:14,505 --> 00:10:16,532
Dwight is not going to
do a good job, it's sad.

199
00:10:16,686 --> 00:10:19,511
And they're expecting excellence
because I did do such a great job.

200
00:10:19,565 --> 00:10:22,040
Two years in a row I killed.
It was amazing.

201
00:10:23,486 --> 00:10:26,043
Confidence, Dwight !

202
00:10:30,268 --> 00:10:31,661
Dwight.

203
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:34,530
If you could travel anywhere
in the world, where would you go ?

204
00:10:34,578 --> 00:10:36,130
I can travel anywhere, except Cuba.

205
00:10:36,158 --> 00:10:38,413
And I WILL travel to New Zealand.

206
00:10:38,698 --> 00:10:40,640
And walk the Lord of the
Rings trail to Mordor

207
00:10:40,687 --> 00:10:42,260
And then I will hike Mt. Doom.

208
00:10:42,337 --> 00:10:44,481
So, you know, just leave me alone.

209
00:10:44,675 --> 00:10:46,852
Okay, just trying to get
some advice on my trip.

210
00:10:47,005 --> 00:10:50,133
Oh please, you're not taking any trip.

211
00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:57,613
You know, I majored in
public speaking in college?

212
00:10:57,816 --> 00:10:59,260
You did ?

213
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,282
And the first thing
that they teach you

214
00:11:01,318 --> 00:11:03,130
is that you've gotta
be true to yourself.

215
00:11:03,865 --> 00:11:06,213
And you are all about authority.

216
00:11:06,506 --> 00:11:08,730
Yes, I am.

217
00:11:08,858 --> 00:11:12,013
The great speakers throughout
history were not joke tellers.

218
00:11:12,516 --> 00:11:14,283
They were people of passion.

219
00:11:14,388 --> 00:11:16,853
So, if you wanna do well today,
you gotta do what they did.

220
00:11:16,896 --> 00:11:19,210
- Which is?
- You gotta wave your arms.

221
00:11:19,307 --> 00:11:22,161
And you've gotta pound your fists.
Many times.

222
00:11:24,057 --> 00:11:25,313
So as to emphasize your point.

223
00:11:25,346 --> 00:11:27,820
Okay, I didn't actually major
in public speaking.

224
00:11:28,157 --> 00:11:31,563
But I did download speeches from
some of history's famous dictators.

225
00:11:31,887 --> 00:11:35,511
Like this one.
Originally given by Benito Mussolini.

226
00:11:35,788 --> 00:11:38,912
Okay, look, I know you're giving
this speech on your own.

227
00:11:39,057 --> 00:11:41,512
But I wrote up a few talking
points for you to look at.

228
00:11:41,606 --> 00:11:43,731
- Hope you don't mind.
-  I'll glance at it.

229
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,333
It's time, Dwight.
The grim reaper is here.

230
00:11:51,835 --> 00:11:54,443
The very best of luck to you, Dwight.

231
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,380
Thank you, Angela.

232
00:12:02,408 --> 00:12:04,532
Why'd you pick the
VR for the reception ?

233
00:12:04,915 --> 00:12:08,063
Roy has a connection.
It's nicer than you think.

234
00:12:10,035 --> 00:12:11,010
You're  inviting Jim ?

235
00:12:11,118 --> 00:12:13,712
Of course, he's one of
my closest friends.

236
00:12:15,886 --> 00:12:17,632
All right.

237
00:12:18,148 --> 00:12:20,393
Ready ? Here we go !

238
00:12:26,315 --> 00:12:28,903
Wow, it's a little bit bigger
than I remembered.

239
00:12:29,305 --> 00:12:32,411
Come on, we're down here in the front.

240
00:12:55,468 --> 00:12:58,211
I am just feeling under the weather.

241
00:12:58,438 --> 00:13:01,662
And, I think that I will
go home and rest.

242
00:13:01,968 --> 00:13:04,502
I've never ever seen
you take a sick day.

243
00:13:04,655 --> 00:13:07,312
Well, I've seen you take enough
for the both of us.

244
00:13:08,217 --> 00:13:13,093
Next, I'd like to introduce the
Dunder-Mifflin salesman of the year.

245
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:15,363
Dwight Schrute !

246
00:13:23,006 --> 00:13:25,253
<i>Dwight, how we doing ?</i>

247
00:13:25,907 --> 00:13:27,432
- Okay, you know what ?
- Okay.

248
00:13:27,517 --> 00:13:30,960
You know what ? Okay. No, no problem.
You're lucky you have me,

249
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,782
- I am going to cover for you.
All right !

250
00:13:40,138 --> 00:13:44,703
Good morning Vietnam !

251
00:13:47,668 --> 00:13:50,240
I am not Dwight Schrute.

252
00:13:50,635 --> 00:13:54,012
Not at all. I am Michael Scott.

253
00:13:54,185 --> 00:13:56,513
His mentor and boss.

254
00:13:56,636 --> 00:14:00,561
And until Dwight comes up,
if he ever does,

255
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:05,113
I wanted to say a few words
about excellence.

256
00:14:05,308 --> 00:14:09,990
What makes a work
environment excellent ?

257
00:14:10,485 --> 00:14:12,881
Well, there are many things.

258
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:17,392
I believe, that do such
a thing of that... nature.

259
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:21,980
And one would be humor.

260
00:14:22,788 --> 00:14:27,641
What is the difference between
a salesman and a saleswoman ?

261
00:14:37,466 --> 00:14:40,690
I always set it at 69.

262
00:14:41,935 --> 00:14:43,861
Maybe we'll use a DJ.

263
00:14:43,885 --> 00:14:46,311
That's the one thing Roy's in
charge of for this wedding,

264
00:14:46,366 --> 00:14:48,593
but all he's managed
to do is set a date.

265
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:51,390
Well, he did a great job.
June 10th is perfect.

266
00:14:51,656 --> 00:14:54,360
I want a June wedding.
I've always wanted one.

267
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:58,111
Ryan, do you know when you
would want to get married ?

268
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:01,300
Actually, I don't see
ever getting married.

269
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:12,563
Ryan, you should be more sensitive.
It's obvious she likes you.

270
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:15,510
- And comments like that, they just...
- I know what I said.

271
00:15:17,237 --> 00:15:20,063
I'm very sorry, I did not know that
you were wearing a hearing aid.

272
00:15:20,217 --> 00:15:21,891
And I just thought you were speaking...

273
00:15:22,286 --> 00:15:24,391
Abnormally.

274
00:15:25,188 --> 00:15:29,391
And now, the black guy from
the Police Academy movies.

275
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:32,391
A robot.

276
00:15:37,115 --> 00:15:39,813
Michael Winslow. Anyone ?

277
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,793
Car starting.

278
00:15:46,997 --> 00:15:49,211
All right, Dwight Schrute, everyone.

279
00:15:50,446 --> 00:15:53,790
Good luck.
That is a tough crowd.

280
00:16:09,938 --> 00:16:12,762
Blood alone moves
the wheels of history !

281
00:16:15,796 --> 00:16:18,771
Have you ever asked yourselves 
in an hour of meditation,

282
00:16:19,075 --> 00:16:22,152
which everyone finds during the day,

283
00:16:22,705 --> 00:16:25,822
How long we have been
striving for greatness ?

284
00:16:26,846 --> 00:16:32,521
Not only the years we've been at war,
the war of work.

285
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,822
But from the moment, as a child,

286
00:16:35,937 --> 00:16:39,611
when we realized that the
world could be conquered.

287
00:16:40,427 --> 00:16:42,870
It has been a lifetime struggle.

288
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:45,043
A never-ending fight.

289
00:16:45,165 --> 00:16:51,340
I say to you, and you will understand,
that it is a privilege to fight !

290
00:16:58,106 --> 00:17:00,100
We  are warriors !

291
00:17:04,756 --> 00:17:08,792
Salesmen of Northeastern
Pennsylvania, I ask you.

292
00:17:08,947 --> 00:17:12,900
Once more, rise and be worthy
of this historical hour.

293
00:17:22,276 --> 00:17:25,170
I got a time share on Key West
that might be available.

294
00:17:26,506 --> 00:17:28,570
Maybe, thanks.

295
00:17:28,945 --> 00:17:31,621
- You really think you're gonna go?
- Yeah, I'm definitely going.

296
00:17:31,745 --> 00:17:34,170
Nice, send me a postcard.

297
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:36,522
Jim has worked at the same
place for five years.

298
00:17:36,698 --> 00:17:39,621
Jim eats the same ham and cheese
sandwich everyday for lunch.

299
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:41,700
I don't know,
if I were a betting man,

300
00:17:41,747 --> 00:17:44,642
I'd say he will have a fun
weekend in Philadelphia.

301
00:17:50,897 --> 00:17:55,570
No revolution is worth anything
unless it can defend itself !

302
00:17:59,696 --> 00:18:03,053
<i>Some people will tell you
salesman is a bad word.</i>

303
00:18:03,855 --> 00:18:07,420
<i>They'll conjure up images
of used car dealers...</i>

304
00:18:07,937 --> 00:18:10,200
<i>...and door to door charlatans.</i>

305
00:18:10,606 --> 00:18:13,451
<i>This is our duty to change
their perception.</i>

306
00:18:14,538 --> 00:18:17,401
I say, salesmen...

307
00:18:18,027 --> 00:18:21,370
and women...of the world, unite.

308
00:18:21,965 --> 00:18:24,023
We must never acquiesce.

309
00:18:24,245 --> 00:18:26,373
For it is together !

310
00:18:26,925 --> 00:18:30,551
Together that we prevail !

311
00:18:30,796 --> 00:18:36,632
We must never concede control
of the motherland, for it is...

312
00:18:37,007 --> 00:18:41,012
Together that we prevail !

313
00:18:51,555 --> 00:18:54,231
Australia ?
I've always wanted to go there.

314
00:18:54,387 --> 00:18:55,410
I'm going.

315
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:58,762
I'm a little nervous to run into Dwight
on his connecting flight to Mordor,

316
00:18:59,435 --> 00:19:02,163
But, other than that...,
Yeah, I bought the ticket.

317
00:19:02,337 --> 00:19:03,411
Non-refundable.

318
00:19:03,486 --> 00:19:05,301
That's awesome.
Where are you staying ?

319
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:06,481
I don't know.

320
00:19:06,528 --> 00:19:09,263
I feel like I have plenty of time
to figure out the details, but.

321
00:19:09,288 --> 00:19:10,310
When are you leaving ?

322
00:19:11,616 --> 00:19:13,883
I'm leaving...on June 8th.

323
00:19:16,785 --> 00:19:17,792
Yeah.

324
00:19:18,286 --> 00:19:20,363
And I'm really sorry about that.
I just...

325
00:19:21,138 --> 00:19:23,490
Yeah, that's too bad.

326
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,460
Yeah.

327
00:19:28,465 --> 00:19:30,313
Do you want me to take
these on my way out ?

328
00:19:30,638 --> 00:19:33,233
It's okay, I got it.

329
00:19:33,636 --> 00:19:34,490
Alright.

330
00:19:38,838 --> 00:19:40,583
Ok. Thanks.

331
00:19:40,868 --> 00:19:43,913
- There you are. What happened ?
- I got thirsty. How it go ?

332
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:46,442
It was amazing.
I wish you would have been there.

333
00:19:46,787 --> 00:19:48,580
You would not believe
what happened here.

334
00:19:48,616 --> 00:19:50,491
What, did something happen ?

335
00:19:50,506 --> 00:19:52,611
This woman came in.

336
00:19:52,865 --> 00:19:55,292
Sat down. Ordered a drink.

337
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:58,263
The bartender asked for her ID,
which I thought was odd.

338
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,360
- Because I pegged her at, like, 35.
- Weird.

339
00:20:00,405 --> 00:20:01,321
Yeah, really weird.

340
00:20:01,377 --> 00:20:04,100
So, she's like, I don't have my ID.
Please, give me one.

341
00:20:04,427 --> 00:20:07,200
And he's like, I can't do that.
I can't serve you.

342
00:20:07,286 --> 00:20:08,812
- Con artist.
- She might have been.

343
00:20:08,855 --> 00:20:11,233
So she says fine,
I will go to my room.

344
00:20:11,365 --> 00:20:13,090
I will get my purse,
I will come back.

345
00:20:13,165 --> 00:20:14,313
I'll show you my ID.

346
00:20:14,508 --> 00:20:15,831
She hasn't come back yet.

347
00:20:15,935 --> 00:20:18,772
She's probably in the room
drinking from the minibar.

348
00:20:19,317 --> 00:20:20,423
 Right ?

349
00:20:21,435 --> 00:20:24,310
<i>Dwight gave a great speech.
That's the word on the street, anyway.</i>

350
00:20:24,897 --> 00:20:28,670
<i>And I entertained Dwight to no
end with my bar story.</i>

351
00:20:28,986 --> 00:20:30,951
<i>I captivated the guy...</i>

352
00:20:31,266 --> 00:20:33,523
who captivated 1 000 guys.

353
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:37,181
Can you believe that ? 1 000 guys.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,667
I am actually looking forward to
take your daughter to work day.

2
00:00:02,685 --> 00:00:03,918
I am not great with kids.

3
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:05,420
But I want to get better.

4
00:00:05,654 --> 00:00:06,991
Because I'm getting married.

5
00:00:07,761 --> 00:00:09,709
So I put out a bunch of
extra candy on my desk.

6
00:00:09,744 --> 00:00:11,173
So the kids will come talk to me.

7
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:15,288
Like the witch in Hansel and Gretel.

8
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:17,909
Bribery. Nice.

9
00:00:18,373 --> 00:00:19,821
I have more.

10
00:00:19,965 --> 00:00:21,000
It's Pam.

11
00:00:21,103 --> 00:00:22,836
Ms. Beesly if your nasty.

12
00:00:22,979 --> 00:00:24,050
- Oh.
- Janet Jackson.

13
00:00:24,096 --> 00:00:25,756
Hey, you having a wardrobe
malfunction.

14
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:27,381
You can't be you can't be
nasty today.

15
00:00:27,396 --> 00:00:28,370
'Cause of the...

16
00:00:29,025 --> 00:00:30,583
Oh, God. Is that today ?

17
00:00:30,685 --> 00:00:32,023
I reminded you last night.

18
00:00:32,517 --> 00:00:33,810
Listen, I like kids.

19
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,472
But this is not a kids environment.

20
00:00:35,527 --> 00:00:36,752
This is like HBO.

21
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:38,202
No limits.

22
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:39,760
<i>Who knows what I'm gonna say ?</i>

23
00:00:39,836 --> 00:00:40,982
<i>Crazy stuff.</i>

24
00:00:41,145 --> 00:00:42,660
And it is R rated.

25
00:00:42,705 --> 00:00:44,082
It is not rated G.

26
00:00:44,217 --> 00:00:46,771
I am like Eddie Murphy in Raw.

27
00:00:47,217 --> 00:00:50,723
And they are trying to make me into
Eddie Murphy in Daddy Daycare.

28
00:00:50,787 --> 00:00:52,073
Both great movies.

29
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:53,163
But still.

30
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:55,532
Well, I'll be in my office.

31
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:57,311
Don't you think you should
say something ?

32
00:00:57,338 --> 00:00:59,490
- They're cool.
- Michael, I think that as the boss,

33
00:00:59,515 --> 00:01:01,883
- you should... you should really...
- Fine, fine, fine !

34
00:01:01,908 --> 00:01:03,040
Hi children !

35
00:01:03,507 --> 00:01:04,471
I'm Michael Scott.

36
00:01:04,546 --> 00:01:08,013
And I am in charge of this place.

37
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:11,130
How do I make you understand ?

38
00:01:11,275 --> 00:01:13,590
I am like Superman.

39
00:01:14,088 --> 00:01:17,282
And the people who work here are
like citizens of Gotham City.

40
00:01:17,665 --> 00:01:19,132
- That's Batman.
- Okay,

41
00:01:19,195 --> 00:01:20,363
I'm Aquaman.

42
00:01:20,426 --> 00:01:21,800
Where does he live, guys ?

43
00:01:21,906 --> 00:01:23,383
The ocean.

44
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:25,172
I work with a bunch of nerds.

45
00:01:49,706 --> 00:01:53,021
Episode 18 - Season 2
TAKE YOUR DAUGHTER TO WORK DAY

00:01:53,148 --> 00:01:56,330
Synchronisation: Catch 22 team

48
00:02:07,825 --> 00:02:08,962
Hello, tiny one.

49
00:02:09,365 --> 00:02:10,223
Come on.

50
00:02:11,157 --> 00:02:12,240
You are the future.

51
00:02:15,408 --> 00:02:18,062
This is my file cabinet.

52
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:32,452
This is the partition between
my desk and Angela's.

53
00:02:34,338 --> 00:02:38,172
Abby is my fiancee Stacy's daughter.
I think she'll have a good time.

54
00:02:38,536 --> 00:02:41,902
I just hope she doesn't
look on my computer.

55
00:02:43,545 --> 00:02:45,922
Actually, I'd better go check.

56
00:02:48,638 --> 00:02:50,872
Michael, you remember
my daughter Melissa.

57
00:02:50,956 --> 00:02:53,102
Oh, yes. Hello, how are you ?

58
00:02:53,237 --> 00:02:55,721
Good to see you.
Wow, you've really grown up.

59
00:02:55,928 --> 00:02:58,070
You know what ? Don't mind me saying so.

60
00:02:58,167 --> 00:03:00,272
She is turning into a stone cold fox.

61
00:03:00,527 --> 00:03:03,611
Better keep the frat boys away from her.

62
00:03:03,977 --> 00:03:07,303
- I'm in 8th grade.
- She's in middle school.

63
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,960
Yeah, middle school's amazing.
It is extraordinary.

64
00:03:10,135 --> 00:03:11,651
An extraordinary time.

65
00:03:11,795 --> 00:03:13,673
It's not that children
make me uncomfortable.

66
00:03:13,698 --> 00:03:16,280
It's just that, why be a dad
when you can be a fun uncle ?

67
00:03:16,838 --> 00:03:19,570
I've never heard of anyone
rebelling against their fun uncle.

68
00:03:19,896 --> 00:03:21,682
They want how many spiral pads?

69
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:26,383
Well, 50. I over ordered
because they had a back order.

70
00:03:26,877 --> 00:03:28,930
<i>I got permission to
bring Jakey in to work.</i>

71
00:03:29,046 --> 00:03:31,700
Which is great because,
he got suspended this week.

72
00:03:31,758 --> 00:03:34,130
And now I don't have
to pay for a sitter.

73
00:03:34,225 --> 00:03:36,661
Can you pull that down there ?

74
00:03:37,605 --> 00:03:39,181
Okay,  tell 'em what you wanted to say.

75
00:03:39,358 --> 00:03:41,200
- Do you need any help ?
- No,

76
00:03:41,748 --> 00:03:43,263
Thanks.

77
00:03:43,325 --> 00:03:45,331
We'd have to explain everything.

78
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:47,932
It's probably just easier
if we do it ourselves.

79
00:03:49,308 --> 00:03:52,190
All right, I wasn't expecting that.
Let's, go draw.

80
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:55,653
Oh, my God. She is so cute,
I wanna die.

81
00:03:55,725 --> 00:03:57,963
Don't you just love kids, Angela ?

82
00:03:58,516 --> 00:04:01,700
I guess I wouldn't mind a
pair of small, well behaved boys.

83
00:04:01,935 --> 00:04:05,081
God, I cannot wait to get
pregnant and have babies.

84
00:04:06,795 --> 00:04:08,983
Kelly and I both agreed that
we would just have fun.

85
00:04:09,507 --> 00:04:12,850
And I'm learning that fun for Kelly is,

86
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:15,480
getting married and having babies.

87
00:04:15,826 --> 00:04:17,191
Immediately.

88
00:04:17,426 --> 00:04:18,682
With me.

89
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:21,630
Just compare last year's
orders with this year's.

90
00:04:22,876 --> 00:04:25,001
Yeah, I'm looking at it right now.

91
00:04:28,648 --> 00:04:29,723
Yes.

92
00:04:31,728 --> 00:04:32,742
We...

93
00:04:34,427 --> 00:04:35,981
Yeah, they're very...

94
00:04:37,438 --> 00:04:39,450
They're different.

95
00:04:39,786 --> 00:04:41,422
Yeah, we can stick with last year's.

96
00:04:41,517 --> 00:04:43,700
We're just gonna have to
supplement it somehow.

97
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,220
Hey, Abby !

98
00:04:45,315 --> 00:04:48,123
Do you wanna help me
shred some old documents ?

99
00:04:48,797 --> 00:04:50,292
It's actually pretty cool.

100
00:04:50,575 --> 00:04:52,571
No thanks.

101
00:04:53,278 --> 00:04:55,321
I only have one goal today

102
00:04:55,516 --> 00:04:57,431
To make one kid like me.

103
00:04:58,795 --> 00:04:59,991
Just one.

104
00:05:00,106 --> 00:05:01,390
What are you reading ?

105
00:05:01,497 --> 00:05:04,302
"From the Mixed up Files of
Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler."

106
00:05:05,258 --> 00:05:06,792
Best book.

107
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:09,830
- Yeah, but I read it before.
- So have I.

108
00:05:10,545 --> 00:05:11,683
Hey, question.

109
00:05:11,747 --> 00:05:15,121
if you had to spend the night in the Met
Ior the aquarium which would it be ?

110
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:17,332
-  Definitely the aquarium.
- Definitely.

111
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,512
Yes. Glad you said that.

112
00:05:20,535 --> 00:05:22,892
You don't want to help me
with some of my sales, do you ?

113
00:05:22,915 --> 00:05:24,011
'Cause I'm kinda swamped.

114
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:25,263
- Sure.
- Really ?

115
00:05:25,755 --> 00:05:26,591
Yes.

116
00:05:26,706 --> 00:05:28,121
- And you're Abby, right ?
- Yes

117
00:05:28,165 --> 00:05:29,373
I'm Jim.

118
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,120
And, let's sell some paper.

119
00:05:32,236 --> 00:05:35,441
- All right.
- Let's start with your mom.

120
00:05:35,806 --> 00:05:37,533
Yes. Well.

121
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:38,951
We can...

122
00:05:41,305 --> 00:05:43,183
Hey, you know what ?
Can I call you back ?

123
00:05:43,305 --> 00:05:45,013
I'll call you right back. Yes, I promise

124
00:05:49,345 --> 00:05:51,681
Hello, can I help you ?

125
00:05:54,295 --> 00:05:57,073
You can pick that up if you want.
That's all right.

126
00:05:58,798 --> 00:06:00,581
Wanna bring it over.. 

127
00:06:00,638 --> 00:06:03,412
Here, I'll make some room.

128
00:06:10,138 --> 00:06:11,403
My name's Michael.

129
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,303
- What's your name ?
- Sasha.

130
00:06:13,395 --> 00:06:15,053
Nice to meet you.

131
00:06:15,145 --> 00:06:16,490
Oh, you know what that is ?

132
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:18,920
That is a train whistle.

133
00:06:18,995 --> 00:06:20,992
Like I'm the conductor.

134
00:06:21,227 --> 00:06:23,711
But I'm sort of the conductor
of the office here, right ?

135
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,582
- You wanna try ?
- Sure.

136
00:06:28,235 --> 00:06:30,660
All  aboard for sales !

137
00:06:31,065 --> 00:06:33,093
Next stop, Cook...

138
00:06:33,746 --> 00:06:35,700
Camonga !

139
00:06:37,408 --> 00:06:39,743
- You broke my hand.
- There is no way that hurt.

140
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:42,143
Really ?
Cause she's pretty strong, Dwight.

141
00:06:42,678 --> 00:06:44,633
Little girl, come over here.

142
00:06:46,018 --> 00:06:47,590
Shake my hand.

143
00:06:47,897 --> 00:06:49,960
Come on, I don't have all day.

144
00:06:52,223 --> 00:06:53,746
I didn't feel anything. Nothing.

145
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:56,600
You're so weak.

146
00:07:00,556 --> 00:07:02,986
Excuse me, these are expensive
collector's items. Okay ?

147
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,560
- Do you have any computer games ?
- No.

148
00:07:05,606 --> 00:07:07,610
I don't have computer games
on my work computer.

149
00:07:07,647 --> 00:07:08,841
That would be inappropriate.

150
00:07:08,876 --> 00:07:10,672
Yeah, Meredith doesn't have
any either.

151
00:07:10,758 --> 00:07:13,391
- It's so lame here.
- You call your mom Meredith ?

152
00:07:14,348 --> 00:07:16,770
- That's very disrespectful.
- Whatever, okay ?

153
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,580
You can refer to me as Mr. Schrute.

154
00:07:19,988 --> 00:07:21,520
That's your name ?

155
00:07:21,746 --> 00:07:23,511
- Mr. Poop?
- Shrute.

156
00:07:23,668 --> 00:07:26,130
- Mr. Shrute.
- Sure, Mr. Poop.

157
00:07:29,576 --> 00:07:31,162
Schrute.

158
00:07:38,488 --> 00:07:40,742
Are you Mother Goose ?

159
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:46,820
I drink like, 100 iced Macchiatos a
day and practically nothing else.

160
00:07:47,906 --> 00:07:49,520
There's a really cool coffee place,

161
00:07:49,618 --> 00:07:52,332
Jitters, at the Steamtown Mall.
You ever been there ?

162
00:07:53,027 --> 00:07:54,962
- No.
- You've never been to Jitters ?

163
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,683
Ryan, you are so dorky.

164
00:07:58,036 --> 00:07:59,652
Gimme your number
so I can text you.

165
00:08:03,428 --> 00:08:05,042
Come on.

166
00:08:05,335 --> 00:08:06,730
Can I have your e-mail address ?

167
00:08:06,797 --> 00:08:09,013
I just thought you should know.

168
00:08:09,426 --> 00:08:11,742
I think something a little
fishy is going on.

169
00:08:11,847 --> 00:08:13,633
- A little fishy ?
- Yeah.

170
00:08:13,838 --> 00:08:16,303
I've been noticing them all day.
And I was thinking...

171
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:18,582
That little girl is a child !

172
00:08:18,757 --> 00:08:22,222
I don't wanna see you sniffing
around her anymore this afternoon !

173
00:08:22,248 --> 00:08:24,430
Do you understand ?
Boy, have you lost your mind ?

174
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:26,182
- No, no.
- Cause I'll help you find it.

175
00:08:26,225 --> 00:08:28,713
Watcha looking for ? Ain't nobody
gonna help you out there.

176
00:08:28,736 --> 00:08:31,381
Jesus can come through that door,
and he's not gonna help you.

177
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:33,210
If you don't stop sniffing
around my child.

178
00:08:33,236 --> 00:08:34,850
Stanley yelled at me today.

179
00:08:34,885 --> 00:08:38,191
That was one of the most
frightening experiences of my life.

180
00:08:50,126 --> 00:08:51,492
That was Greensleeves.

181
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:54,572
A traditional English ballad about
the beheaded Anne Boleyn.

182
00:08:54,996 --> 00:08:57,373
And now, a very special treat.

183
00:08:57,485 --> 00:09:00,371
A book my granmutter used
to read me when I was a kid.

184
00:09:00,595 --> 00:09:02,031
This is a very special story

185
00:09:02,285 --> 00:09:08,102
It's called Struwwelpeter by
Heinrich Hoffmann from 1864.

186
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:14,282
The great tall tailor always comes
to little girls that suck their thumbs.

187
00:09:14,347 --> 00:09:16,371
Are you listening, Sasha ? Right ?

188
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:18,203
And ere they dream what he's about,

189
00:09:18,405 --> 00:09:23,041
he takes his great sharp scissors out
and then cuts their thumbs clean off.

190
00:09:23,327 --> 00:09:25,781
- Dwight, What the hell are you reading?
- There's a photo.

191
00:09:25,855 --> 00:09:27,321
These are cautionary tales for kids.

192
00:09:27,356 --> 00:09:29,983
- Yeah, you know what ? No...
- My granmutter used to read...

193
00:09:30,038 --> 00:09:31,941
They kids don't wanna
hear some weirdo book,

194
00:09:32,006 --> 00:09:34,102
that your Nazi war criminal
grandmother gave you.

195
00:09:34,218 --> 00:09:36,020
- What's a Nazi ?
- What's a Nazi ?

196
00:09:36,098 --> 00:09:38,573
Nazi was a facist movement in the 1930s.

197
00:09:38,618 --> 00:09:40,872
Don't, talk about Nazis in
front of... You know what ?

198
00:09:40,895 --> 00:09:43,311
They're gonna have nightmares.
Why don't you just shut it ?

199
00:09:43,358 --> 00:09:46,111
I was gonna teach the children
how to make corn husk dolls.

200
00:09:46,428 --> 00:09:48,350
Why don't you just leave ? Okay ?

201
00:09:51,035 --> 00:09:52,742
- Bye, Mr. Poop.
- All right

202
00:09:52,785 --> 00:09:54,470
There goes Mr. Poop. Now,

203
00:09:54,815 --> 00:09:56,470
- who likes Dane Cook?
- I do !

204
00:09:56,605 --> 00:09:59,052
Children cannot lie. They are innocent,

205
00:09:59,096 --> 00:10:02,262
and they speak the truth.
And out of the mouths of babes,

206
00:10:02,646 --> 00:10:05,472
Michael Scott is freakin' cool.

207
00:10:13,165 --> 00:10:15,561
You know, I never misbehaved
in front of my father.

208
00:10:15,677 --> 00:10:18,313
Because he was a very
strict disciplinarian.

209
00:10:19,146 --> 00:10:22,393
I can only hope my mate has
some of those same qualities.

210
00:10:27,568 --> 00:10:29,811
This is where the magic happens.

211
00:10:30,228 --> 00:10:32,180
Right over here, let me show you this.

212
00:10:32,355 --> 00:10:33,961
See all these ?

213
00:10:34,566 --> 00:10:36,372
You know what that is ?

214
00:10:36,506 --> 00:10:39,240
That's paper. This is where paper
comes from. Any questions ?

215
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:42,830
So, you cut the paper
and dye it and stuff ?

216
00:10:42,906 --> 00:10:45,533
No, we don't actually cut the paper.
That's a good question.

217
00:10:45,838 --> 00:10:50,070
The paper is sent to us cut and
dyed from a paper manufacturer.

218
00:10:50,308 --> 00:10:54,242
And then we sell it to a business
for more than we pay for it.

219
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:55,700
- That's not fair.
-  No.

220
00:10:55,747 --> 00:10:57,722
- Yes it is.
- No, no.

221
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,882
You need someone in
the middle to facilitate...

222
00:10:59,996 --> 00:11:02,491
- You're just the middle man.
- I'm not just the middle man.

223
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:05,413
Wait, why doesn't the sawmill just
sell the paper directly to people ?

224
00:11:05,476 --> 00:11:07,212
You're describing Office Depot.

225
00:11:07,305 --> 00:11:09,301
And they're kind of running us
out of business.

226
00:11:09,356 --> 00:11:11,672
We have better service than they do.

227
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:17,532
There's Creed ! Let's take a look
at what he's doing, everybody.

228
00:11:19,197 --> 00:11:22,083
This is Creed. And he is in charge of...

229
00:11:22,677 --> 00:11:24,262
Something, right ?
- That is correct.

230
00:11:24,628 --> 00:11:26,181
- Say hi to the kids.
- Hi kids.

231
00:11:27,546 --> 00:11:29,920
You ever seen a foot
with four toes ?

232
00:11:29,966 --> 00:11:32,081
- Cool !
- What are you doing ? Stop it, stop it.

233
00:11:32,197 --> 00:11:34,461
Just no, no, no. No !
Would you cut it out ?

234
00:11:34,956 --> 00:11:37,533
-  What is your problem ?
- Well, the hair covers it up mostly.

235
00:11:37,588 --> 00:11:39,670
We're not gonna see the
four-toed Creed, okay ?

236
00:11:40,118 --> 00:11:43,283
You know, there's something interesting
about me that you might wanna know.

237
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,743
I used to be the star of a kids show.

238
00:11:45,796 --> 00:11:47,632
- No way.
- It's true, I did.

239
00:11:47,785 --> 00:11:49,853
- You serious ? Really ?
- I am totally serious.

240
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:53,113
There was a show called
Fundle Bundle, and I was the star.

241
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:56,202
- That doesn't sound like a show.
-  It's true. I can prove it.

242
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,891
Watch this. Ryan,
can you come here a second ?

243
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,831
I would like you to go to
my mother's house in Dixon City.

244
00:12:03,397 --> 00:12:06,431
And if she's at the pool, the back
kitchen window should be unlocked.

245
00:12:06,457 --> 00:12:08,442
- I want you to boost yourself up.
- All right.

246
00:12:08,465 --> 00:12:10,073
I want you to go down to
the basement.

247
00:12:10,108 --> 00:12:11,701
There is a tape
labeled Fundle Bundle.

248
00:12:11,736 --> 00:12:13,892
I want you to grab it.
I want you to get my guitar.

249
00:12:13,938 --> 00:12:15,962
- Right, okay.
- I want you to get a tambourine.

250
00:12:16,018 --> 00:12:17,682
Do you know how to
play the tambourine ?

251
00:12:17,727 --> 00:12:19,932
I'm already getting the
pizzas from Bernetti's, so...

252
00:12:19,967 --> 00:12:21,970
- You know, I can go with him.
- No ! I will go.

253
00:12:22,047 --> 00:12:24,111
Okay ! Thank you, Ryan

254
00:12:24,306 --> 00:12:25,940
Good attitude. Hottest in the office.

255
00:12:26,097 --> 00:12:28,703
All right, now what kind
of pizza do you like ?

256
00:12:28,885 --> 00:12:31,050
I don't get why parents are
always complaining about,

257
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:33,112
how tuff it is to raise kids.

258
00:12:33,348 --> 00:12:35,511
You joke around with them.
You give 'em pizza

259
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,382
You give 'em candy.
You let them live their lives.

260
00:12:38,548 --> 00:12:39,840
They're adults for God's sake.

261
00:12:39,957 --> 00:12:44,511
I am going to give you a little blast
from the past of Michael Gary Scott,

262
00:12:44,675 --> 00:12:46,271
when he was a child star.

263
00:12:46,468 --> 00:12:49,410
And a show that you might
remember called Fundle Bundle.

264
00:12:49,697 --> 00:12:51,782
Okay, without further ado, Ryan ?

265
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,830
<i>Bundle, are you
ready to come on in ?</i>

266
00:12:55,757 --> 00:12:56,813
<i>Let's have some fun !</i>

267
00:12:56,838 --> 00:13:00,802
That is Miss Trudy. Can't tell from her
costume, but she had an amazing body.

268
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:04,491
Okay, you can fast forward.

269
00:13:04,637 --> 00:13:06,381
And I want you.

270
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:09,511
- Is that a real working windmill ?
- It's coming up. Stop ! Stop. Stop.

271
00:13:11,036 --> 00:13:14,320
Yes. That is Edward R. Meow.

272
00:13:14,906 --> 00:13:17,302
- That's pretty funny.
- Yeah.

273
00:13:19,035 --> 00:13:20,402
<i>Hey, what's your name ?</i>

274
00:13:20,646 --> 00:13:22,771
<i>- My name's Chet.
- Well, hi Chet.</i>

275
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:25,793
- Is that Chet Montgomery ?
-  I don't, I don't know.

276
00:13:25,866 --> 00:13:27,300
Yeah, that is !

277
00:13:27,405 --> 00:13:29,321
He's the meteorologist from channel 4.

278
00:13:29,436 --> 00:13:31,510
Checking in with Chet. Doppler 7.

279
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:33,420
That guy's legit.

280
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:35,762
<i>What do you wanna
be when you grow up ?</i>

281
00:13:36,007 --> 00:13:37,771
<i>I wanna be on TV.</i> 

282
00:13:38,498 --> 00:13:40,481
And he is on TV now !

283
00:13:40,547 --> 00:13:43,432
Will everybody please shut up.
Please. So you don't miss it.

284
00:13:45,005 --> 00:13:46,560
<i>Okay, next.</i>

285
00:13:46,735 --> 00:13:48,941
<i>- So, what's your name ?</i>
- That's me, that's me.

286
00:13:49,127 --> 00:13:53,870
<i>Hi Michael, I'm Ed. What's your
favorite subject at school ?</i>

287
00:13:54,195 --> 00:13:56,450
<i>- Recess.
- Recess.</i>

288
00:13:56,815 --> 00:14:00,351
<i>So, tell me, what do you
wanna be when you grow up ?</i>

289
00:14:00,656 --> 00:14:03,041
<i>I wanna be married
and have 100 kids.<i>

290
00:14:03,178 --> 00:14:04,811
<i>So  I can have 100 friends.<i>

291
00:14:05,075 --> 00:14:07,491
<i>And no one can say
no to being my friend.</i>

292
00:14:14,327 --> 00:14:16,703
<i>Okay. Well, nice talking
with you, Michael.</i>

293
00:14:16,746 --> 00:14:18,442
<i>Back to you Ms. Trudy.</i>

294
00:14:18,907 --> 00:14:21,043
<i>Hi everyone, it's one
of my favorite...</i>

295
00:14:21,107 --> 00:14:23,533
- Could have sworn there was...
- Did you get married ?

296
00:14:24,127 --> 00:14:25,180
- No.
- Why not ?

297
00:14:25,818 --> 00:14:27,290
It just never happened.

298
00:14:28,108 --> 00:14:30,140
So do you have any kids ?

299
00:14:30,867 --> 00:14:31,680
Nope.

300
00:14:31,957 --> 00:14:33,021
Do you have a girlfriend ?

301
00:14:33,117 --> 00:14:35,323
- I do okay.
- Was Chet Montgomery cool back then ?

302
00:14:35,356 --> 00:14:37,811
- Even I have a girlfriend.
- Okay. All right, okay.

303
00:14:37,988 --> 00:14:40,472
So you didn't get to
be what you wanted to be.

304
00:14:42,165 --> 00:14:44,002
I guess not.

305
00:14:45,807 --> 00:14:48,291
You know, I have a load of work to do.

306
00:14:48,406 --> 00:14:51,650
So I am going to grab a
slice of this delish pizza.

307
00:14:52,847 --> 00:14:54,801
And I'm gonna go do my work.

308
00:14:55,698 --> 00:14:56,760
Bye.

309
00:15:06,497 --> 00:15:09,243
He's not coming out.
He won't pick up the phone.

310
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:13,072
I can't believe his mom dressed him
like that. That's the real tragedy.

311
00:15:14,048 --> 00:15:16,233
Pam, Pam ! I love this guy !

312
00:15:26,946 --> 00:15:30,182
So, Melissa, I met your
mom a couple times.

313
00:15:30,326 --> 00:15:32,313
She's so nice.

314
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:34,690
Who, Terri ?

315
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:36,562
That woman is not my mother.

316
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,051
That is my step mother.

317
00:15:43,046 --> 00:15:44,672
Mr. Poop, I have to tell you something.

318
00:15:44,717 --> 00:15:46,291
Okay. But first, that's not my name.

319
00:15:46,867 --> 00:15:48,381
You're ugly.

320
00:15:50,758 --> 00:15:52,973
Well, at least I'm not
a horrible little latchkey kid

321
00:15:53,046 --> 00:15:55,322
who got suspended from school,

322
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,001
so...

323
00:15:57,908 --> 00:15:59,083
Meredith !

324
00:16:12,228 --> 00:16:13,340
Yeah ?

325
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,553
I think these belong to you.

326
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:20,402
That's okay, she can keep those.

327
00:16:21,118 --> 00:16:22,820
Believe me, she has enough toys.

328
00:16:22,977 --> 00:16:25,252
She doesn't need your watch.

329
00:16:26,227 --> 00:16:27,492
Thank you.

330
00:16:30,965 --> 00:16:32,500
Is everything okay ?

331
00:16:34,358 --> 00:16:37,182
You have to ask me that because
you work for human resources.

332
00:16:38,858 --> 00:16:40,351
That's true.

333
00:16:40,478 --> 00:16:42,870
You know, sure,
playing the field is great.

334
00:16:42,937 --> 00:16:46,183
Don't get me wrong. But there's more
to life than notches on my bedpost.

335
00:16:47,545 --> 00:16:48,803
Tell me something honestly.

336
00:16:48,865 --> 00:16:53,701
Do you think, that it is too
late for me to have kids ?

337
00:16:54,817 --> 00:16:57,023
Well, you need a wife
first or at least a girlfriend.

338
00:16:57,137 --> 00:16:58,861
- What about...
-Not Jan.

339
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:01,271
- Okay.
- You really wanna have kids,

340
00:17:01,467 --> 00:17:03,613
I guess you could somehow.

341
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:08,820
Foster parent or something.

342
00:17:11,035 --> 00:17:13,163
Or biologically.

343
00:17:13,586 --> 00:17:15,480
Somehow.

344
00:17:15,997 --> 00:17:18,943
Thanks, that's...No, that really
means a lot to me.

345
00:17:22,586 --> 00:17:25,552
Hey, does Sasha have a godfather ?
Because...

346
00:17:25,636 --> 00:17:27,931
- Yes.
- O-kay.

347
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,222
Is it okay if I take one ?

348
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,853
- Sure.
-Thank you.

349
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:34,980
You're welcome.

350
00:17:35,258 --> 00:17:36,413
Is your job hard ?

351
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,400
It's not too bad.

352
00:17:39,695 --> 00:17:42,213
I get to shred things sometimes.
Do you wanna see ?

353
00:17:42,368 --> 00:17:44,002
- Yeah !
- Really ?

354
00:17:44,077 --> 00:17:45,992
- Yeah.
- Okay.

355
00:17:48,848 --> 00:17:52,132
Here it is.
Don't put your fingers in there.

356
00:17:55,186 --> 00:17:56,933
- Cool ?
- Yeah.

357
00:17:58,356 --> 00:18:00,040
Yeah, I get to do this,
like, every week.

358
00:18:00,127 --> 00:18:01,581
- That's so awesome. 
- I know.

359
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:03,842
Yes, it is true

360
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:08,193
I, Michael Scott am signing up
with an online dating service.

361
00:18:08,478 --> 00:18:11,281
Thousands of people have done it,
and I'm going to do it.

362
00:18:11,668 --> 00:18:13,432
I need a user name.

363
00:18:13,588 --> 00:18:15,561
And I have a great one.

364
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:21,933
Little Kid Lover.

365
00:18:22,046 --> 00:18:25,452
That way, people will know exactly
where my priorities are at.

366
00:18:28,836 --> 00:18:30,413
Go  ahead.

367
00:18:30,956 --> 00:18:33,442
Do you wanna come over
for dinner tonight ?

368
00:18:33,577 --> 00:18:35,912
Oh man, I would love to.

369
00:18:36,008 --> 00:18:38,372
I can't tonight, but can
I come over some other time ?

370
00:18:38,758 --> 00:18:41,363
What are you doing ?
You never have plans.

371
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:43,692
Thanks, Kev.

372
00:18:43,845 --> 00:18:46,353
- I'm actually going on a date.
- Nice.

373
00:18:47,618 --> 00:18:49,730
Hey, no, please. You can't leave yet.

374
00:18:49,835 --> 00:18:51,773
There's still one more
thing we need to do.

375
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:56,632
<i>You, you are on the road</i>

376
00:18:58,037 --> 00:19:00,011
<i>Must have a code</i>

377
00:19:00,887 --> 00:19:03,822
<i>That you can live by</i>

378
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:08,630
<i>And so become yourself</i>

379
00:19:09,746 --> 00:19:12,462
<i>Because the past</i>

380
00:19:12,888 --> 00:19:15,730
<i>Is just a good-bye</i>

381
00:19:16,626 --> 00:19:20,402
<i>And teach your children well</i>

382
00:19:20,468 --> 00:19:23,140
Why does he own a guitar if he
doesn't know how to play it ?

383
00:19:23,226 --> 00:19:25,950
I think he thought his
ukulele skills would transfer.

384
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:32,843
<i>And feed them on your dreams</i>

385
00:19:32,945 --> 00:19:34,311
My theory is that...

386
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:36,723
<i>The one they picked</i>

387
00:19:37,598 --> 00:19:40,041
<i>The one you know by</i>

388
00:19:41,566 --> 00:19:45,400
<i>Don't you ever ask them why</i>

389
00:19:45,857 --> 00:19:48,582
<i>If I told you you would cry</i>

390
00:19:48,775 --> 00:19:52,702
<i>You just look at them and sigh</i>

391
00:19:56,085 --> 00:19:59,541
<i>And know they love you</i>

392
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:02,220
And they do.
Your parents love you very much.

393
00:20:02,427 --> 00:20:03,663
One more time.

394
00:20:03,837 --> 00:20:04,842
<i>You...</i>



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,195
So Phil, has recruited
me to sell these cards.

2
00:00:03,441 --> 00:00:06,022
- And now I'm recruiting you.
- Who is this guy again?

3
00:00:06,254 --> 00:00:08,103
Don't worry about Phil.
He drives a Corvette.

4
00:00:08,173 --> 00:00:10,132
He's doing just fine. Okay,

5
00:00:10,275 --> 00:00:13,700
Calling cards, are the
wave of the future.

6
00:00:13,838 --> 00:00:16,573
- These things sell themselves.
- Who uses calling cards anymore ?

7
00:00:16,628 --> 00:00:18,542
You know what ?
That's a nice attitude, Ryan.

8
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:20,851
I'm just helping you invest
in your future, my friend.

9
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:22,575
It sounds like a get-rich-quick scheme.

10
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:24,430
Yes, thank you.
You will get rich quick.

11
00:00:24,463 --> 00:00:25,876
We all will.

12
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:28,310
Didn't you lose a lot of money
on that other investment,

13
00:00:28,356 --> 00:00:30,446
- the one from the e-mail ?
- You know what, Toby ?

14
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:33,412
When the son of the deposed king
of Nigeria e-mails you directly,

15
00:00:33,526 --> 00:00:35,422
asking for help, you help.

16
00:00:35,565 --> 00:00:38,390
His father ran the
freaking country, okay ?

17
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:43,380
All right. So raise your hand
if you want to get rich.

18
00:00:43,566 --> 00:00:44,140
All right.

19
00:00:44,215 --> 00:00:47,243
No. How is this not a pyramid scheme ?

20
00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:49,722
All right, let me explain again.

21
00:00:52,617 --> 00:00:55,021
Phil, has recruited me and another guy.

22
00:00:55,116 --> 00:00:58,323
Now we are getting three people each.

23
00:00:58,497 --> 00:01:01,873
The more people that get involved,
the more people who are investing,

24
00:01:01,967 --> 00:01:04,811
And the more money we're all gonna make.
It's not a pyramid scheme.

25
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,720
It's not even a scheme,
per se, it's...

26
00:01:17,008 --> 00:01:19,150
I have to go make a call.

27
00:01:42,177 --> 00:01:44,741

30
00:01:59,718 --> 00:02:01,152
Happy Birthday, Michael.

31
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:03,602
- What ?
- I said Happy Birthday.

32
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:05,930
Thank you. That's really nice.

33
00:02:06,106 --> 00:02:10,522
Today is my b-day and people
around here just go crazy for it.

34
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:12,731
I don't know why.
Oh, fun fact.

35
00:02:13,138 --> 00:02:16,022
I share my birthday with Eva Longoria.

36
00:02:17,168 --> 00:02:21,302
So I have a perfect icebreaker
if I ever meet Teri Hatcher.

37
00:02:21,596 --> 00:02:24,022
- What's up ?
- Hi.

38
00:02:25,155 --> 00:02:27,832
- Happy Birthday.
- Thank you sir.

39
00:02:34,477 --> 00:02:38,132
- Did you hear anything yet ?
- No, I'm still waiting.

40
00:02:41,137 --> 00:02:42,453
- Yeah.
- Yes.

41
00:02:42,548 --> 00:02:44,842
- There he is, the birthday boy.
- God.

42
00:02:44,937 --> 00:02:46,731
- Birthday hug.
- No, no, no. New suit.

43
00:02:47,186 --> 00:02:48,800
- Please.
- That suit is amazing.

44
00:02:48,846 --> 00:02:51,692
Thank you very much. It is from Italy.

45
00:02:51,785 --> 00:02:54,393
Actually, no, Bulgaria.

46
00:02:55,107 --> 00:02:56,853
- So...
- Maybe I should get one.

47
00:02:56,908 --> 00:02:59,002
Good luck. One of a kind.

48
00:02:59,187 --> 00:03:00,803
eBay. Question.

49
00:03:00,925 --> 00:03:03,890
May I be in charge of the
party planning festivities ?

50
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:06,433
Not necessary. The party planning
committee is all over it.

51
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,601
They've been working 24/7
all day yesterday.

52
00:03:08,817 --> 00:03:11,512
Excellent. On my part,
I did manage to reserve the...

53
00:03:11,587 --> 00:03:15,232
Don't. No. Please. Don't want
to spoil it for anybody.

54
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:17,532
- Spoil the surprise.
- Let's get the party started.

55
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,111
Let's get the party started.
Not the way I taught you.

56
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,953
When should we bring out the cake ?
1:00 or 1:30 ?

57
00:03:27,045 --> 00:03:29,881
- 1:00's good.
- 1:30.

58
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,482
I'm sorry. Are we boring you ?

59
00:03:33,998 --> 00:03:36,180
- I don't...
- Party planning committee, listen up.

60
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:38,862
Michael would like trick
candles for his birthday cake.

61
00:03:38,978 --> 00:03:41,411
- So make that a priority.
- Where do we get those ?

62
00:03:41,536 --> 00:03:42,552
Not my problem.

63
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:45,900
Here's a list of things that Michael
would like to be surprised by.

64
00:03:47,465 --> 00:03:49,263
Michael wants a strippergram?

65
00:03:49,358 --> 00:03:52,360
Yes but he doesn't want
to know when or whom.

66
00:03:52,538 --> 00:03:54,450
No. This is a closed door meeting.

67
00:04:05,206 --> 00:04:07,461
- Yeah.
<i>- Michael, I have Jan on the line.</i>

68
00:04:07,758 --> 00:04:10,043
Great. Put her through.

69
00:04:10,555 --> 00:04:12,860
- <i>Hello, Michael.</i>
- Hey, you.

70
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:15,332
<i>I'm returning your call,
you said it was urgent.</i>

71
00:04:15,536 --> 00:04:18,301
It is urgent. I just wanted to call
and wish you a happy birthday.

72
00:04:18,336 --> 00:04:20,362
<i>Well, today's not my birthday, so.</i>

73
00:04:20,506 --> 00:04:21,652
Really ?

74
00:04:21,745 --> 00:04:23,761
'Cause  I thought we had
the same birthday.

75
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:28,560
- <i>Happy Birthday, Michael.</i>
- Thanks.

76
00:04:29,658 --> 00:04:32,110
- <i>Am I on camera ?</i>
- Nope.

77
00:04:32,978 --> 00:04:34,621
Totally private.

78
00:04:34,827 --> 00:04:37,180
You can say whatever is in your heart.

79
00:04:42,036 --> 00:04:43,980
You can take a five if you want.

80
00:05:02,607 --> 00:05:04,590
Somebody brought in
doughnuts for my birthday.

81
00:05:05,136 --> 00:05:07,443
- Happy Birthday.
- Thanks.

82
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:13,323
Man, I'm so sorry.

83
00:05:13,537 --> 00:05:15,981
- When do you find out ?
- They said this afternoon.

84
00:05:16,268 --> 00:05:18,331
They're waiting on a second opinion.

85
00:05:18,548 --> 00:05:20,022
Second opinion on what ?

86
00:05:20,118 --> 00:05:22,171
I might have skin cancer.

87
00:05:22,307 --> 00:05:25,243
No. I was watching "Grey's Anatomy",
and there was a lifeguard on it.

88
00:05:25,297 --> 00:05:27,830
- And he had skin cancer too.
- Kelly, you know what...

89
00:05:28,007 --> 00:05:30,870
I never really thought about death
until Princess Diana died.

90
00:05:31,095 --> 00:05:33,750
That was the saddest funeral ever.

91
00:05:35,327 --> 00:05:37,571
That and my sister's.

92
00:05:37,695 --> 00:05:39,241
Who brought in doughnuts ?

93
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,270
Somebody got doughnuts
for my birthday.

94
00:05:41,468 --> 00:05:44,112
- Happy Birthday.
- You didn't know it was my birthday.

95
00:05:44,207 --> 00:05:45,502
I guess I forgot.

96
00:05:45,616 --> 00:05:47,901
Well, I guess I forgot
to give you a doughnut.

97
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:51,130
You serious ?

98
00:06:00,837 --> 00:06:03,243
- Skin cancer is treatable.
- Right.

99
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:04,463
It's gonna be okay.

100
00:06:04,556 --> 00:06:06,282
You don't know it's going to be okay.

101
00:06:06,337 --> 00:06:08,680
Don't give him false hope.

102
00:06:11,296 --> 00:06:13,762
It's probably nothing though.

103
00:06:14,177 --> 00:06:16,201
Hi. Delivery for Michael Scott.

104
00:06:17,116 --> 00:06:20,201
Here we go. Okay, this is great.

105
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,223
Thank you, my friends, she is perfect.

106
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:26,241
Dwight, may I have your chair please ?

107
00:06:26,405 --> 00:06:28,921
And some singles, if you will.

108
00:06:29,035 --> 00:06:30,353
All right.

109
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:34,652
Okay.

110
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:37,763
All  right.

111
00:06:37,807 --> 00:06:39,293
This has arms.
Is that gonna be..

112
00:06:39,387 --> 00:06:40,760
Is that all right ?

113
00:06:41,197 --> 00:06:42,703
Sure.

114
00:06:42,885 --> 00:06:43,973
Okay.

115
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,622
I'm so nervous.

116
00:06:48,838 --> 00:06:51,520
- I can sign for it.
- Oh, thanks.

117
00:06:53,127 --> 00:06:55,133
When I was seven,

118
00:06:55,488 --> 00:06:58,043
my mother hired a pony,

119
00:06:58,505 --> 00:07:01,973
and a cart to come to
my house for all the kids.

120
00:07:02,896 --> 00:07:04,200
And...

121
00:07:04,696 --> 00:07:07,742
I got a really bad rash, from the pony.

122
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,161
And all the kids got to ride the pony.

123
00:07:10,207 --> 00:07:11,330
And I had to go inside.

124
00:07:11,456 --> 00:07:15,610
And my mother was rubbing cream
on me for probably three hours.

125
00:07:15,796 --> 00:07:17,413
And I never came outside.

126
00:07:17,658 --> 00:07:20,210
And by the time I got out, 
the pony was already in the truck.

127
00:07:20,256 --> 00:07:21,820
And around the corner.

128
00:07:22,438 --> 00:07:24,051
So that was my worst birthday.

129
00:07:32,688 --> 00:07:35,610
Stop it. Stop ! What is that ?

130
00:07:36,668 --> 00:07:38,510
It's For the Longest
Time by William Joel.

131
00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:41,380
- It's one of your favorite songs.
- Yeah, when it's on the radio.

132
00:07:41,438 --> 00:07:43,403
My birthday blows.

133
00:07:43,938 --> 00:07:46,360
Nobody even signed my birthday poster.

134
00:07:46,658 --> 00:07:50,672
Apparently my mother is the only one who
cares enough to send me anything.

135
00:07:50,857 --> 00:07:52,701
I probably care more than she does.

136
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,663
You're  making it worse.

137
00:07:56,096 --> 00:07:58,821
I bet Luke Perry's friends
don't treat him like this.

138
00:08:00,528 --> 00:08:03,360
- When does he hear ?
- Sometime today.

139
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:05,650
Poor Kevin.

140
00:08:07,227 --> 00:08:11,283
If I knew I had a week to live
would probably go to Europe...

141
00:08:12,365 --> 00:08:14,233
And South America...

142
00:08:14,816 --> 00:08:16,843
And the Grand Canyon...

143
00:08:17,326 --> 00:08:19,630
And I would want to
see the Pacific Ocean.

144
00:08:21,103 --> 00:08:23,146
It would be a pretty busy week.

145
00:08:23,489 --> 00:08:26,320
That's a list price of $4.50.

146
00:08:26,636 --> 00:08:29,816
Unfortunately, this item is on back...

147
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,673
order.
Michael ! Michael ! Michael,

148
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:35,461
Michael, Michael.
Come here, come here, come here.

149
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,661
- What ?
- Listen up, everyone.

150
00:08:38,005 --> 00:08:40,081
It is 11:23 exactly.

151
00:08:40,305 --> 00:08:43,960
The exact moment when you emerged
from your mother's vaginal canal.

152
00:08:44,597 --> 00:08:45,641
So ?

153
00:08:46,518 --> 00:08:48,262
Have a seat, please.

154
00:08:48,407 --> 00:08:49,851
- God.
- There is a tradition,

155
00:08:49,928 --> 00:08:54,700
hat the Hebrews have of hoisting
the birthday boy up on a chair.

156
00:08:54,855 --> 00:08:58,041
So come over, help me celebrate
Michael's birth moment. Kevin.

157
00:08:58,256 --> 00:09:00,492
- No, no, no.
- I'll do it.

158
00:09:00,635 --> 00:09:02,641
- Ryan, come on. Let's do this.
- Creed.

159
00:09:02,847 --> 00:09:04,023
Come on, Stanley, let's go.

160
00:09:04,165 --> 00:09:06,103
I feel like we should
go get Kevin something.

161
00:09:06,495 --> 00:09:08,920
Do you think we can sneak out of here ?

162
00:09:09,478 --> 00:09:13,792
Maybe, but were going to need
somebody to create a diversion and...

163
00:09:13,945 --> 00:09:15,913
<i>On three, we're going
to hoist away! Ready ?</i>

164
00:09:16,116 --> 00:09:16,990
Okay.

165
00:09:17,065 --> 00:09:19,413
- Happy birth moment, Michael.
- Thank you.

166
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:22,252
One, two, three.

167
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,481
All right. All right. Watch it.

168
00:09:25,626 --> 00:09:26,503
- Please.
- Oscar.

169
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:27,671
It wasn't me.

170
00:09:30,795 --> 00:09:33,453
Okay, that is not an eight-foot sub.

171
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,540
We don't make an eight-foot sub.
This is eight one-foot subs.

172
00:09:39,428 --> 00:09:42,150
- All right, what's the damage?
-  39.60.

173
00:09:45,688 --> 00:09:46,690
39.

174
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:54,311
60.

175
00:09:54,655 --> 00:09:57,361
Why tip someone for a job
I'm capable of doing myself ?

176
00:09:58,077 --> 00:09:59,411
I can deliver food.

177
00:09:59,577 --> 00:10:01,171
I can drive a taxi.

178
00:10:01,288 --> 00:10:03,751
I can, and do, cut my own hair.

179
00:10:04,048 --> 00:10:06,700
I did, however, tip my urologist.

180
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:10,770
Because I am unable to pulverize
my own kidney stones.

181
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,783
- Here they come.
- Get in here.

182
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:15,642
- Come and get it.
- Everybody.

183
00:10:15,697 --> 00:10:17,983
- Birthday party subs. My gift to you.
- What is this ?

184
00:10:18,027 --> 00:10:20,181
- Baloney, tomato, and ketchup.
- The best.

185
00:10:20,296 --> 00:10:21,750
- These are all the same.
- Yes.

186
00:10:21,965 --> 00:10:24,043
Baloney ? I don't eat baloney.

187
00:10:24,388 --> 00:10:26,881
Well, then just have the
tomato and ketchup. Still good.

188
00:10:26,986 --> 00:10:28,011
No.

189
00:10:28,206 --> 00:10:30,492
- Just the bread. It's fresh baked.
- No.

190
00:10:31,948 --> 00:10:32,971
Okay.

191
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:36,380
Get whatever you want.
You can choke on it.

192
00:10:36,596 --> 00:10:38,532
When I was 16,

193
00:10:38,985 --> 00:10:43,512
I was supposed to go out on
a date with a girl named Julie.

194
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,692
But there was another
Michael in the class,

195
00:10:47,787 --> 00:10:50,673
that she apparently
thought the date was with.

196
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:53,270
So she went out with him on my birthday.

197
00:10:54,197 --> 00:10:57,843
And she got him a
cake at the restaurant.

198
00:10:58,186 --> 00:10:59,850
And it wasn't even his birthday.

199
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,672
But I heard about it
the next day in school. So...

200
00:11:03,478 --> 00:11:05,890
That was the worst
birthday I think I ever had.

201
00:11:06,195 --> 00:11:08,300
So, we got Kev some stuff.

202
00:11:09,688 --> 00:11:12,242
Party pack of M&Ms, his favorite candy.

203
00:11:12,525 --> 00:11:15,433
A DVD of American Pie 2,
which is his favorite movie.

204
00:11:15,535 --> 00:11:16,751
And he lent it to Creed.

205
00:11:16,858 --> 00:11:19,231
So I can guarantee you
he won't get that back.

206
00:11:19,377 --> 00:11:21,650
69 Cup of Noodles.

207
00:11:21,846 --> 00:11:24,892
Which we realize sounds crass,
but it is his favorite number.

208
00:11:25,025 --> 00:11:26,401
And his favorite lunch.

209
00:11:29,945 --> 00:11:33,753
Hey, temp, you know, we still got
five feet of sandwich left.

210
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:37,032
- Someone ate three feet of that thing ?
- Hell, yeah.

211
00:11:37,216 --> 00:11:39,540
Save room for ice cream cake.

212
00:11:39,675 --> 00:11:40,743
- Thank you.
- I got it.

213
00:11:40,806 --> 00:11:43,042
What are you... it's the party
planning committee.

214
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,361
His is the most important
day of the year.

215
00:11:45,936 --> 00:11:47,881
I can't risk anything.

216
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:50,200
Fine.

217
00:11:50,706 --> 00:11:52,550
What about that meeting...

218
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:54,290
later...

219
00:11:54,526 --> 00:11:56,943
to discuss finances ?

220
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:58,760
Yes.

221
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,442
But don't expect any cookie.

222
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:04,411
But what if I'm hungry ?

223
00:12:04,895 --> 00:12:06,671
No cookie.

224
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:25,931
What ?

225
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,612
You use fabric softener ?

226
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:29,802
- Yeah. You don't ?
- No, I do.

227
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:38,100
<i>Happy Birthday dear Michael.</i>

228
00:12:39,797 --> 00:12:43,521
<i>Happy Birthday...</i>

229
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:47,032
<i>To you !</i>

230
00:12:47,187 --> 00:12:48,873
Hello. Hey.

231
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,360
Kevin.
Respect the birthday, please.

232
00:12:52,476 --> 00:12:54,461
No, not yet.

233
00:12:55,418 --> 00:12:57,193
I will. Thanks.

234
00:12:57,805 --> 00:12:59,792
-  It was just Stacey.
- Are you done ?

235
00:13:00,305 --> 00:13:01,341
Good.

236
00:13:02,655 --> 00:13:04,252
- Okay.
- Here we go.

237
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,230
- I'm gonna...
- Make a wish.

238
00:13:14,705 --> 00:13:16,113
I asked for trick candles.

239
00:13:16,177 --> 00:13:17,842
- Pam was supposed to get them.
- Okay.

240
00:13:17,877 --> 00:13:20,260
Well, when she comes back,
we'll do it again.

241
00:13:21,785 --> 00:13:24,631
Hello. What about the birthday boy ?

242
00:13:24,716 --> 00:13:27,053
Haven't had a hug all day.

243
00:13:27,538 --> 00:13:29,280
No one cares about your birthday.

244
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,192
Kevin's waiting to hear
if he has skin cancer.

245
00:13:40,858 --> 00:13:43,021
That sucks. Great.

246
00:13:47,216 --> 00:13:48,923
That's good timing.

247
00:13:49,098 --> 00:13:50,610
That's...

248
00:13:50,915 --> 00:13:52,571
Sorry. That's terrible.

249
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:54,140
Terrible news. That's terrible..

250
00:13:55,436 --> 00:13:58,462
Terrible news, for the both of us.

251
00:14:06,257 --> 00:14:08,511
- We should probably head back.
- Yeah, okay.

252
00:14:09,768 --> 00:14:11,381
I dare you to make an announcement.

253
00:14:11,515 --> 00:14:13,940
You dare me ? How old are you ?

254
00:14:14,147 --> 00:14:15,950
Just quit stalling.

255
00:14:17,716 --> 00:14:20,910
Luke, this is your father.

256
00:14:21,605 --> 00:14:24,193
Come set the table for dinner.

257
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:27,090
Such a dork.

258
00:14:27,976 --> 00:14:31,573
Jim Halpert, price check
on fabric softener.

259
00:14:31,715 --> 00:14:33,053
- The kind ...
- Ma'am, please.

260
00:14:33,118 --> 00:14:36,271
- Don't touch that. That is not a toy.
- I'm sorry.

261
00:14:37,136 --> 00:14:38,172
Sorry.

262
00:14:39,665 --> 00:14:41,823
- How old are you ?
-  I hate you.

263
00:14:42,577 --> 00:14:45,650
Honestly, is there any way
you can get on your fiancee's plan ?

264
00:14:45,726 --> 00:14:47,993
- Our health plan is, it's terrible.
- There you are.

265
00:14:48,026 --> 00:14:49,522
Good news. Did some research.

266
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:53,683
It turns out that 98% of people
with skin cancer fully recover.

267
00:14:54,515 --> 00:14:55,762
Still scary.

268
00:14:55,805 --> 00:14:58,113
Yeah. But it's not brain cancer.

269
00:14:58,476 --> 00:15:01,040
And it shouldn't stop us
from having fun.

270
00:15:01,136 --> 00:15:02,961
You know what they say
the best medicine is.

271
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:06,551
Well, the doctor said a combination
of Interferon and Dacarbazine.

272
00:15:06,997 --> 00:15:09,442
And laughter also.

273
00:15:10,346 --> 00:15:13,090
I don't really think people
are in the laughing mood.

274
00:15:13,736 --> 00:15:15,350
Why are you here ?

275
00:15:15,446 --> 00:15:17,381
I didn't even invite you
to my birthday party.

276
00:15:17,457 --> 00:15:19,552
- I work here.
- "I work here."

277
00:15:19,596 --> 00:15:22,530
All right. Well, you know what,
since Toby doesn't speak for everybody.

278
00:15:22,597 --> 00:15:23,870
And I am your boss.

279
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,923
I think you should just go home.
Take the rest of the afternoon off.

280
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,261
- Take a sick day.
- If I go home now,

281
00:15:29,425 --> 00:15:31,160
I'll just drive myself crazy. 

282
00:15:31,275 --> 00:15:34,042
Well, you're pretty much driving
everybody else here crazy.

283
00:15:37,026 --> 00:15:40,230
Crazy with worry.

284
00:16:04,857 --> 00:16:06,902
Where have you been ?
And don't say the bathroom.

285
00:16:06,956 --> 00:16:10,013
- Cause I kicked in all the stalls.
- Well, that's an invasion of privacy.

286
00:16:10,068 --> 00:16:12,492
- So I'm going to tell Michael.
- Please, don't.

287
00:16:13,627 --> 00:16:17,063
- You, owe me.
- Excuse me, everyone.

288
00:16:17,547 --> 00:16:19,651
Attention, please.

289
00:16:20,338 --> 00:16:23,142
Kevin, we're going to take
you to a very special place.

290
00:16:23,246 --> 00:16:25,590
A  place that will make you happy.

291
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,791
And a place that is far,
far away from the evil sun.

292
00:16:29,707 --> 00:16:33,013
Is this trip in any way
related to your birthday ?

293
00:16:33,586 --> 00:16:36,270
How dare you sir. You're gross.

294
00:16:38,305 --> 00:16:40,893
- That should not be there.
- I'll get someone to take it down.

295
00:16:40,935 --> 00:16:43,723
No, it's all right. It's already up.
Just leave it. Where's Kevin ?

296
00:16:43,806 --> 00:16:45,793
Come on !
Let's get our skate on.

297
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:50,793
Don't be scared.
You're good.

298
00:16:56,688 --> 00:16:58,330
- I wanna go
- Turn to the right.

299
00:16:58,516 --> 00:17:00,852
- Do you think you can let go ?
- No.

300
00:17:05,248 --> 00:17:06,952
Is that Michael ?

301
00:17:07,155 --> 00:17:09,421
Yeah, I've been pretty much
skating my whole life.

302
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:11,492
I thought about playing in the NHL.

303
00:17:11,548 --> 00:17:13,730
But you're on the road so much.

304
00:17:13,826 --> 00:17:16,112
Get no time to spend
with your wife and kids.

305
00:17:16,508 --> 00:17:19,131
And I really want a wife and kids.

306
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:26,360
I got it !

307
00:17:26,706 --> 00:17:31,210
Hey, Pam, all the stuff with Kevin,
it's pretty scary.

308
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,383
And I'm thinking that the next time
you're in the shower,

309
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:37,320
you should check yourself out.
You know, give yourself an exam.

310
00:17:37,507 --> 00:17:39,882
Those things are like ticking time bags.

311
00:17:40,065 --> 00:17:42,581
All right ? Think about it.

312
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:46,592
Something to think about.

313
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,772
- Just can't relax about it...
- Kevin.

314
00:17:50,357 --> 00:17:52,333
- Have you heard anything yet ?
- No, not yet.

315
00:17:52,465 --> 00:17:54,230
Okay, well, Livestrong.

316
00:17:54,376 --> 00:17:56,011
- Okay, Michael.
- Michael ?

317
00:17:56,106 --> 00:17:57,760
Yeah. Carol ?

318
00:17:58,137 --> 00:18:00,282
- Yeah.
- She sold me my condo.

319
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:03,331
Hey, was this place on the market or...?

320
00:18:04,536 --> 00:18:07,231
No. I don't just sell real estate.

321
00:18:07,335 --> 00:18:08,791
My daughter has a skating lesson.

322
00:18:08,937 --> 00:18:10,623
Oh, these all your kids ?

323
00:18:10,788 --> 00:18:12,352
No, just the front two.

324
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,140
Oh, hey guys. What's up ?
You want to go for a ride ?

325
00:18:15,225 --> 00:18:16,962
- Is that okay ?
- Sure.

326
00:18:17,076 --> 00:18:19,292
Cool. All right.
Grab on. Here we go.

327
00:18:19,487 --> 00:18:22,551
You ready ? Hang on tight. All right.

328
00:18:23,087 --> 00:18:26,772
- We are moving.
- We are really moving now.

329
00:18:31,785 --> 00:18:34,763
<i>Push.
Good. That's great. You got it.</i>

330
00:18:35,428 --> 00:18:36,852
Scuse me.

331
00:18:39,027 --> 00:18:42,372
Hello ? Yeah, okay.

332
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:45,980
All right.

333
00:18:47,405 --> 00:18:49,672
Okay, I will. Thanks.

334
00:18:50,975 --> 00:18:53,322
It's negative.

335
00:19:02,106 --> 00:19:05,850
We're going to beat this, okay ?
We're gonna... come here.

336
00:19:07,997 --> 00:19:11,120
Well, apparently,
in the medicine community,

337
00:19:11,206 --> 00:19:14,921
negative means good, which
makes absolutely no sense.

338
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:20,461
In the real world community,
that would be chaos.

339
00:19:21,457 --> 00:19:24,133
This is awesome.

340
00:19:24,477 --> 00:19:26,831
Thanks you guys.

341
00:19:27,405 --> 00:19:29,872
Okay, who's this from ?

342
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:36,161
- Look at that jersey.
- Turn it around.

343
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:37,503
- Turn it around.
- Cool.

344
00:19:39,338 --> 00:19:40,200
Great.

345
00:19:40,365 --> 00:19:42,583
- Thank you. Dwight.
- From Dwight. Number one !

346
00:19:42,687 --> 00:19:44,182
- That's great. Thanks.
- Michael.

347
00:19:44,636 --> 00:19:47,950
- This is from all of us.
- You didn't need to do that.

348
00:19:50,976 --> 00:19:54,991
Night Swept. This is really amazing.

349
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:57,642
Thank you. I love it.

350
00:19:58,076 --> 00:20:00,762
Michael's birthday was
actually pretty cool.

351
00:20:01,627 --> 00:20:03,313
It was a good day.

352
00:20:03,437 --> 00:20:04,953
I don't know.

353
00:20:05,535 --> 00:20:07,361
It was a good day.

<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,195
Итак, Фил поручил мне продать
эти карточки,

2
00:00:03,441 --> 00:00:06,022
а я поручаю это вам.
- А кто он такой?

3
00:00:06,254 --> 00:00:08,103
За Фила не переживай.
Он ездит на Корвете.

4
00:00:08,173 --> 00:00:10,132
У него все отлично.

5
00:00:10,275 --> 00:00:13,700
Телефонные карты -
веяние будущего.

6
00:00:13,838 --> 00:00:16,573
- Они продают сами себя.
- Да кто вообще пользуется телефонными картами?

7
00:00:16,628 --> 00:00:18,542
Знаешь что?
Хорошее замечание, Райн.

8
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:20,851
Я всего лишь помогаю вам
обеспечить ваше будущее.

9
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:22,575
Звучит как реклама: «Разбогатей быстро и без усилий».

10
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:24,430
Да, спасибо.
И мы разбогатеем очень быстро.

11
00:00:24,463 --> 00:00:25,876
Мы все.

12
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:28,310
А вы разве уже не теряли деньги,
на инвестициях

13
00:00:28,356 --> 00:00:30,446
по электронной почте?
- Знаешь, Тоби?

14
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:33,412
Когда сын свергнутого короля Нигерии
по электронной почте

15
00:00:33,526 --> 00:00:35,422
просит ему помочь, ты ему помогаешь.

16
00:00:35,565 --> 00:00:38,390
Его папаша просто сбежал из
этой чертовой страны.

17
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:43,380
Ладно. Поднимите руки,
те кто хочет разбогатеть.

18
00:00:43,566 --> 00:00:44,140
Так.

19
00:00:44,215 --> 00:00:47,243
Нет. Вам не кажется что это финансовая пирамида?

20
00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:49,722
Так, давай я еще раз объясню.

21
00:00:52,617 --> 00:00:55,021
Фил нашел меня, и еще одного парня.

22
00:00:55,116 --> 00:00:58,323
Теперь каждый из нас должен найти еще троих.

23
00:00:58,497 --> 00:01:01,873
Чем больше людей будут вовлечены,
тем больше будет инвестиций.

24
00:01:01,967 --> 00:01:04,811
И мы, соответственно, получим больше денег.
Это не пирамида.

25
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,720
Это даже и не схема,
это...

26
00:01:17,008 --> 00:01:19,150
Мне нужно позвонить.

27
00:01:42,177 --> 00:01:44,741
Эпизод 19 - Сезон 2
День Рождения Майкла

30
00:01:59,718 --> 00:02:01,152
С днем Рождения,  Майкл!

31
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:03,602
- Что?
- Я говорю с днем Рождения.

32
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:05,930
Спасибо. Очень мило.

33
00:02:06,106 --> 00:02:10,522
Сегодня у меня день Рождения,
и люди в офисе просто на ушах стоят.

34
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:12,731
Уж и не знаю почему.
Да, кстати,

35
00:02:13,138 --> 00:02:16,022
я родился в один день с Евой Лангорией.

36
00:02:17,168 --> 00:02:21,302
Так что будет легко растопить лед
при встрече с Терри Хетчером.

37
00:02:21,596 --> 00:02:24,022
- Эй?
- Привет.

38
00:02:25,155 --> 00:02:27,832
- С днем Рождения.
- Благодарю, сэр.

39
00:02:34,477 --> 00:02:38,132
- Ты уже что-нибудь слышал?
- Нет, я еще жду.

40
00:02:41,137 --> 00:02:42,453
- Войдите.
- Да.

41
00:02:42,548 --> 00:02:44,842
- Вот он, наш именинник.
- Боже.

42
00:02:44,937 --> 00:02:46,731
- Праздничное объятие.
- Нет, нет, нет. На мне новый костюм.

43
00:02:47,186 --> 00:02:48,800
- Пожалуйста.
- Костюм потрясающий.

44
00:02:48,846 --> 00:02:51,692
Большое спасибо. Он итальянский.

45
00:02:51,785 --> 00:02:54,393
Вообще нет, Болгарский.

46
00:02:55,107 --> 00:02:56,853
- Да...
- Может мне стоит купить такой же.

47
00:02:56,908 --> 00:02:59,002
Удачи. У нас такие не продаются.

48
00:02:59,187 --> 00:03:00,803
Вопрос.

49
00:03:00,925 --> 00:03:03,890
Можно я возглавлю
подготовку к вашему празднику?

50
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:06,433
В этом нет необходимости. Подготовкой занимается специальный комитет.

51
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,601
Они занимались этим весь вчерашний день.

52
00:03:08,817 --> 00:03:11,512
Отлично, но я со своей стороны...

53
00:03:11,587 --> 00:03:15,232
Нет. не надо, пожалуйста. Не хочу чтобы все догадались что будет.

54
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:17,532
- Хочу чтобы это был сюрприз.
- Ну что, тогда начнем праздновать.

55
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,111
Попразднуем.
Я тебя не так учил.

56
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,953
Во сколько будем выносить торт?
В час, или час тридцать?

57
00:03:27,045 --> 00:03:29,881
- В час нормально.
- В час тридцать.

58
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,482
Прости, мы тебе наскучили?

59
00:03:33,998 --> 00:03:36,180
- Нет, я...
- Планировочный комитет, минутку внимания.

60
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:38,862
Майкл хочет
чтобы в торте были негаснущие свечи.

61
00:03:38,978 --> 00:03:41,411
- Позаботьтесь об этом.
- Где мы их возьмем?

62
00:03:41,536 --> 00:03:42,552
Не мои проблемы.

63
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:45,900
Вот список того, что
Майкл хочет видеть на дне Рождения.

64
00:03:47,465 --> 00:03:49,263
Майкл хочет стриптезершу?

65
00:03:49,358 --> 00:03:52,360
Да, но ему лучше не знать,
когда это будет и кто.

66
00:03:52,538 --> 00:03:54,450
Это закрытое собрание.

67
00:04:05,206 --> 00:04:07,461
<i>- Да.
- Майкл, Джен звонит.</i>

68
00:04:07,758 --> 00:04:10,043
Отлично. Соедини.

69
00:04:10,555 --> 00:04:12,860
<i>- Здравствуй, Майкл.
- Привет.</i>

70
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:15,332
<i>Ты просил меня перезвонить,
сказал что это важно.</i>

71
00:04:15,536 --> 00:04:18,301
Это важно. Я звонил тебе,
что бы поздравить с днем Рождения.

72
00:04:18,336 --> 00:04:20,362
<i>Ну, сегодня не мой день Рождения.</i>

73
00:04:20,506 --> 00:04:21,652
Да?

74
00:04:21,745 --> 00:04:23,761
А мне казалось что у
нас день Рождения в один день.

75
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:28,560
<i>- С днем Рождения, Майкл.
- Спасибо.</i>

76
00:04:29,658 --> 00:04:32,110
<i>- Разговор снимают?
- Нет.</i>

77
00:04:32,978 --> 00:04:34,621
Мы абсолютно одни.

78
00:04:34,827 --> 00:04:37,180
Можешь говорить все что хочешь.

79
00:04:42,036 --> 00:04:43,980
Можешь взять пять, если хочешь.

80
00:05:02,607 --> 00:05:04,590
Кто-то принес мне на
день Рождения пончики.

81
00:05:05,136 --> 00:05:07,443
- С днем Рождения.
- Спасибо.

82
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:13,323
Чувак, мне так жаль.

83
00:05:13,537 --> 00:05:15,981
- Когда все выяснится?
- Они говорят что в полдень.

84
00:05:16,268 --> 00:05:18,331
Ждут результатов повторного анализа.

85
00:05:18,548 --> 00:05:20,022
Повторного анализа на что?

86
00:05:20,118 --> 00:05:22,171
У меня возможно рак кожи.

87
00:05:22,307 --> 00:05:25,243
Не может быть. Я смотрела «Анатомию Джерри», там был один спасатель.

88
00:05:25,297 --> 00:05:27,830
- И у него тоже был рак кожи.
- Келли...

89
00:05:28,007 --> 00:05:30,870
Я вообще-то никогда не задумывалась о смерти, пока принцесса Диана не погибла.

90
00:05:31,095 --> 00:05:33,750
Это были самые грустные похороны.

91
00:05:35,327 --> 00:05:37,571
Эти, и еще моей сестры.

92
00:05:37,695 --> 00:05:39,241
Кто принес пончики?

93
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,270
Кто-то принес на мой
день Рождения пончики.

94
00:05:41,468 --> 00:05:44,112
-С днем Рождения.
- Ты не знал что у меня день Рождения?

95
00:05:44,207 --> 00:05:45,502
Я забыл.

96
00:05:45,616 --> 00:05:47,901
Ну, а я тогда забыл
дать тебе пончик.

97
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:51,130
Вы серьезно?

98
00:06:00,837 --> 00:06:03,243
- Рак кожи это ужасно.
- Да уж.

99
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:04,463
Все будет в порядке.

100
00:06:04,556 --> 00:06:06,282
Откуда ты знаешь что все будет в порядке?

101
00:06:06,337 --> 00:06:08,680
Зачем его обнадеживать?

102
00:06:11,296 --> 00:06:13,762
Да может еще ничего и нет.

103
00:06:14,177 --> 00:06:16,201
Здравствуйте. Посылка для Майкла Скотта.

104
00:06:17,116 --> 00:06:20,201
Отлично. Вот и она!

105
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,223
Спасибо друзья, она ничего.

106
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:26,241
Дуайт, дай-ка мне кресло.

107
00:06:26,405 --> 00:06:28,921
И какую-нибудь музыку.

108
00:06:29,035 --> 00:06:30,353
Хорошо.

109
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:34,652
Так.

110
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:37,763
Хорошо.

111
00:06:37,807 --> 00:06:39,293
У меня тут оружие.
Все будет..

112
00:06:39,387 --> 00:06:40,760
Все в порядке?

113
00:06:41,197 --> 00:06:42,703
Ну да.

114
00:06:42,885 --> 00:06:43,973
Хорошо.

115
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,622
Я так нервничаю.

116
00:06:48,838 --> 00:06:51,520
- Я могу расписаться.
- О, спасибо.

117
00:06:53,127 --> 00:06:55,133
Когда мне было семь,

118
00:06:55,488 --> 00:06:58,043
мама наняла пони,

119
00:06:58,505 --> 00:07:01,973
и повозку, чтобы
покатать меня и всех детей.

120
00:07:02,896 --> 00:07:04,200
И...

121
00:07:04,696 --> 00:07:07,742
Я заработал очень неприятную сыпь от этого пони.

122
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,161
Дети продолжали кататься.

123
00:07:10,207 --> 00:07:11,330
А мне пришлось уйти.

124
00:07:11,456 --> 00:07:15,610
И моя мама натирала меня мазью наверное часа три.

125
00:07:15,796 --> 00:07:17,413
Я так и не вышел на улицу.

126
00:07:17,658 --> 00:07:20,210
А когда я вышел,
пони переехал трактор.

127
00:07:22,438 --> 00:07:24,051
Это был мой худший день Рождения.

128
00:07:32,688 --> 00:07:35,610
Стой, стой. Что это еще такое?

129
00:07:36,668 --> 00:07:38,510
Это на долгую память,
Уильяма Джоэла.

130
00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:41,380
- Это одна из ваших любимых песен.
- Да, когда я слышу ее по радио.

131
00:07:41,438 --> 00:07:43,403
Мой день Рождения провалился.

132
00:07:43,938 --> 00:07:46,360
Никто, кроме тебя, даже не расписался на моем плакате.

133
00:07:46,658 --> 00:07:50,672
Я небезразличен только своей маме, она даже подарок прислала.

134
00:07:50,857 --> 00:07:52,701
Мне вы не безразличны еще больше.

135
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,663
Ты перегибаешь палку

136
00:07:56,096 --> 00:07:58,821
Держу пари что друзья Люка Перри, так к нему не относятся.

137
00:08:00,528 --> 00:08:03,360
- Когда скажут?
- В течении дня.

138
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:05,650
Бедный Кевин.

139
00:08:07,227 --> 00:08:11,283
Если бы мне оставалась неделя, я наверное поехала бы в Европу.

140
00:08:12,365 --> 00:08:14,233
И Южную Америку.

141
00:08:14,816 --> 00:08:16,843
Посмотреть на Великий Каньон.

142
00:08:17,326 --> 00:08:19,630
И еще я хочу увидеть
Тихий Океан.

143
00:08:21,103 --> 00:08:23,146
Это была бы очень плотная неделя.

144
00:08:23,489 --> 00:08:26,320
Цена по прайсу - $4.50

145
00:08:26,636 --> 00:08:29,816
Сожалею, но этот пункт мы уже обговорили...

146
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,673
Майкл, Майкл!

147
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:35,461
Майкл, Майкл!
Сюда, сюда, сюда!.

148
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,661
- Что?
- Слушайте все.

149
00:08:38,005 --> 00:08:40,081
Сейчас 11:23.

150
00:08:40,305 --> 00:08:43,960
В этот момент ты покинул
влагалище своей мамы.

151
00:08:44,597 --> 00:08:45,641
Ну и?

152
00:08:46,518 --> 00:08:48,262
Присядь, пожалуйста.

153
00:08:48,407 --> 00:08:49,851
- Боже.
- Это традиция,

154
00:08:49,928 --> 00:08:54,700
Евреи поднимают именинника на стуле.

155
00:08:54,855 --> 00:08:58,041
Ну же, подходите. Помогите мне отпраздновать день Рождения Майкла. Кевин.

156
00:08:58,256 --> 00:09:00,492
- Нет, нет, нет.
- Я сделаю это.

157
00:09:00,635 --> 00:09:02,641
- Райн, давай сделаем это.
- Крид.

158
00:09:02,847 --> 00:09:04,023
Давайте же, Стенли.

159
00:09:04,165 --> 00:09:06,103
Думаю нам надо что-нибудь
купить Кевину.

160
00:09:06,495 --> 00:09:08,920
Думаешь у нас получится ускользнуть отсюда?

161
00:09:09,478 --> 00:09:13,792
Возможно, но нам понадобится кто-нибудь, чтобы отвлечь внимание...

162
00:09:13,945 --> 00:09:15,913
<i>Насчет три поднимаем его.
Райн?</i>

163
00:09:16,116 --> 00:09:16,990
Хорошо.

164
00:09:17,065 --> 00:09:19,413
- С днем Рождения ,Майкл.
- Спасибо.

165
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:22,252
Раз, два, три.

166
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,481
Ладно, хорошо, аккуратнее.

167
00:09:25,626 --> 00:09:26,503
- Пожалуйста.
- Оскар.

168
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:27,671
Это был не я.

169
00:09:30,795 --> 00:09:33,453
Так, это не восьмифутовый багет.

170
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,540
У нас нет восьмифутовых.
Здесь восемь штук по одному футу.

171
00:09:39,428 --> 00:09:42,150
- Ладно, сколько я должен?
-  39.60.

172
00:09:45,688 --> 00:09:46,690
39.

173
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:54,311
60.

174
00:09:54,655 --> 00:09:57,361
Зачем давать чаевые за то,
что можешь сделать сам?

175
00:09:58,077 --> 00:09:59,411
Я могу сам доставить еду.

176
00:09:59,577 --> 00:10:01,171
Могу водить такси.

177
00:10:01,288 --> 00:10:03,751
Я могу себя постригать, что и делаю.

178
00:10:04,048 --> 00:10:06,700
А вот своему урологу я дал на чай.

179
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:10,770
Потому что сам бы я не смог
избавиться от камней в почках.

180
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,783
- Вот и они.
- Давайте-ка сюда.

181
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:15,642
- Налегайте.
- Все.

182
00:10:15,697 --> 00:10:17,983
- Праздничный багет. Мой подарок.
- Что это?

183
00:10:18,027 --> 00:10:20,181
- Колбаса, помидоры и кетчуп.
- Лучшая еда.

184
00:10:20,296 --> 00:10:21,750
- Они все одинаковые.
- Да.

185
00:10:21,965 --> 00:10:24,043
Колбаса? Я не ем колбасу.

186
00:10:24,388 --> 00:10:26,881
Ну, тогда оставь только помидоры и кетчуп.
Тоже неплохо.

187
00:10:26,986 --> 00:10:28,011
Нет.

188
00:10:28,206 --> 00:10:30,492
- Просто хлеб. Он свежий.
- Нет.

189
00:10:31,948 --> 00:10:32,971
Хорошо.

190
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:36,380
Возьмите все что захотите.
Не буду вас уговаривать.

191
00:10:36,596 --> 00:10:38,532
Когда мне было 16,

192
00:10:38,985 --> 00:10:43,512
Я должен был пойти на свидание с девушкой, по имени Джули.

193
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,692
А в нашем классе был еще один Майкл,

194
00:10:47,787 --> 00:10:50,673
и она полагала что пойдет на свидание с ним.

195
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:53,270
С ним она и пошла.
В мой день Рождения.

196
00:10:54,197 --> 00:10:57,843
Она даже угостила его тортом.

197
00:10:58,186 --> 00:10:59,850
Это был даже не его день Рождения.

198
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,672
Я понял что к чему только на следующий день, в школе.

199
00:11:03,478 --> 00:11:05,890
Думаю, это был худший день Рождения.

200
00:11:06,195 --> 00:11:08,300
Итак, мы кое-что купили Кевину.

201
00:11:09,688 --> 00:11:12,242
Праздничную упаковку M&Ms, его любимые конфеты.

202
00:11:12,525 --> 00:11:15,433
Фильм «Американский пирог 2»,
его любимый фильм.

203
00:11:15,535 --> 00:11:16,751
Он дал его посмотреть Криду,

204
00:11:16,858 --> 00:11:19,231
Так что думаю, он не получит ее назад.

205
00:11:19,377 --> 00:11:21,650
69 упаковок лапши.

206
00:11:21,846 --> 00:11:24,892
Это его любимое число.

207
00:11:25,025 --> 00:11:26,401
И его любимый обед.

208
00:11:29,945 --> 00:11:33,753
Эй, ты в курсе что у нас осталось еще 5 футов сэндвичей.

209
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:37,032
- Кто-то сумел столько съесть?
- Да черт возьми.

210
00:11:37,216 --> 00:11:39,540
Оставь место для торта-мороженого.

211
00:11:39,675 --> 00:11:40,743
- Спасибо.
- Я возьму.

212
00:11:40,806 --> 00:11:43,042
Что ты... это организационного комитета.

213
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,361
Для него это самый главный день в году.

214
00:11:45,936 --> 00:11:47,881
Я не могу рисковать.

215
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:50,200
Отлично.

216
00:11:50,706 --> 00:11:52,550
Что насчет встречи...

217
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:54,290
позже...

218
00:11:54,526 --> 00:11:56,943
нужно обсудить финансы...

219
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:58,760
Хорошо.

220
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,442
Но не жди сладкого.

221
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:04,411
Но что если я голоден?

222
00:12:04,895 --> 00:12:06,671
Никакого сладкого.

223
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:25,931
Что?

224
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,612
Ты пользуешься отбеливателем?

225
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:29,802
- Да. А ты нет?
- Нет, пользуюсь.

226
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:38,100
<i>С днем Рождения Майкл</i>

227
00:12:39,797 --> 00:12:43,521
<i>С днем Рождения...</i>

228
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:47,032
<i>Тебя !</i>

229
00:12:47,187 --> 00:12:48,873
Привет.

230
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,360
Кевин.
Прояви уважение к празднику.

231
00:12:52,476 --> 00:12:54,461
Нет, еще нет.

232
00:12:55,418 --> 00:12:57,193
Конечно. Пока.

233
00:12:57,805 --> 00:12:59,792
-  Это только Стейси.
- Ты закончил?

234
00:13:00,305 --> 00:13:01,341
Хорошо.

235
00:13:02,655 --> 00:13:04,252
- Хорошо.
- Итак.

236
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,230
- Я собираюсь...
- Загадать желание.

237
00:13:14,705 --> 00:13:16,113
Я просил негаснущие свечи.

238
00:13:16,177 --> 00:13:17,842
- За это отвечала Пэм.
- Так.

239
00:13:17,877 --> 00:13:20,260
Ладно, когда она вернется,
мы все переиграем.

240
00:13:21,785 --> 00:13:24,631
Эй! А как же именинник?

241
00:13:24,716 --> 00:13:27,053
Меня сегодня еще никто не обнял.

242
00:13:27,538 --> 00:13:29,280
Никого не волнует ваш день Рождения.

243
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,192
Кевину должны позвонить,
и сказать есть ли у него рак кожи.

244
00:13:40,858 --> 00:13:43,021
Отстой. Так.

245
00:13:47,216 --> 00:13:48,923
Очень удачное время.

246
00:13:49,098 --> 00:13:50,610
Это...

247
00:13:50,915 --> 00:13:52,571
Извини. Это ужасно.

248
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:54,140
Ужасная новость. Ужас...

249
00:13:55,436 --> 00:13:58,462
Ужасная новость для нас обоих.

250
00:14:06,257 --> 00:14:08,511
- Нам пора возвращаться.
- Да, хорошо.

251
00:14:09,768 --> 00:14:11,381
Осмелишься сделать объявление?

252
00:14:11,515 --> 00:14:13,940
Осмелюсь ли? Тебе сколько лет?

253
00:14:14,147 --> 00:14:15,950
Ну так давай.

254
00:14:17,716 --> 00:14:20,910
Люк, это твой отец.

255
00:14:21,605 --> 00:14:24,193
Иди накрой стол к ужину.

256
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:27,090
Просто домашний тиран.

257
00:14:27,976 --> 00:14:31,573
Джим Хэлперт, заплатите за свой отбеливатель.

258
00:14:31,715 --> 00:14:33,053
- Типа ...
- Мэм, прошу вас.

259
00:14:33,118 --> 00:14:36,271
- Не трогайте. Это не игрушка.
- Извините.

260
00:14:37,136 --> 00:14:38,172
Извините.

261
00:14:39,665 --> 00:14:41,823
- Сколько тебе лет?
-  Ненавижу тебя.

262
00:14:42,577 --> 00:14:45,650
Если честно, есть возможность вписать вас в страховку вашей невесты?

263
00:14:45,726 --> 00:14:47,993
- Наша страховка просто ужасная.
- Вот вы где.

264
00:14:48,026 --> 00:14:49,522
Хорошие новости. Я провел исследование.

265
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:53,683
По статистике, 98% людей с раком кожи излечиваются.

266
00:14:54,515 --> 00:14:55,762
Все равно страшно.

267
00:14:55,805 --> 00:14:58,113
Да, но у тебя же не рак мозга.

268
00:14:58,476 --> 00:15:01,040
И это не должно мешать нам веселиться.

269
00:15:01,136 --> 00:15:02,961
Знаешь какое самое лучшее лекарство?

270
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:06,551
Ну, доктор сказал что сочетание Интерферона и Дакарбазина.

271
00:15:06,997 --> 00:15:09,442
И еще смех.

272
00:15:10,346 --> 00:15:13,090
Мне не кажется что кто-то сейчас в настроении смеяться.

273
00:15:13,736 --> 00:15:15,350
А ты почему здесь?

274
00:15:15,446 --> 00:15:17,381
Я ведь тебя даже не приглашал на праздник.

275
00:15:17,457 --> 00:15:19,552
- Я здесь работаю
- «Я здесь работаю.»

276
00:15:19,596 --> 00:15:22,530
Ладно, знаешь что, Тоби
не говорил за всех, так что...

277
00:15:22,597 --> 00:15:23,870
Я твой начальник.

278
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,923
Думаю тебе нужно идти домой.
Возьми выходной.

279
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,261
- Возьми больничный.
- Если я сейчас пойду домой,

280
00:15:29,425 --> 00:15:31,160
Я просто свихнусь.

281
00:15:31,275 --> 00:15:34,042
Ну, если останешься, ты сведешь с ума всех остальных.

282
00:15:37,026 --> 00:15:40,230
Они сойдут с ума от волнения.

283
00:16:04,857 --> 00:16:06,902
Где ты был?
И не говори что в туалете.

284
00:16:06,956 --> 00:16:10,013
- Потому что я проверил все кабинки.
- Ну, это вообще-то вторжение в личную жизнь.

285
00:16:10,068 --> 00:16:12,492
- Ну, я собираюсь доложить об этом Майклу.
- Пожалуйста, не надо.

286
00:16:13,627 --> 00:16:17,063
- Ты мой должник.
- Послушайте все.

287
00:16:17,547 --> 00:16:19,651
Внимание.

288
00:16:20,338 --> 00:16:23,142
Кевин, мы собираемся отвести тебя, в одно особенное место.

289
00:16:23,246 --> 00:16:25,590
Место, где ты будешь счастлив.

290
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,791
Место далекое от губительного солнца.

291
00:16:29,707 --> 00:16:33,013
Это как-то связанно с вашим днем Рождения?

292
00:16:33,586 --> 00:16:36,270
Как ты мог такое подумать?

293
00:16:38,305 --> 00:16:40,893
«С днем Рождения, Майкл»
- Этого не должно было здесь висеть.
- Я позову кого-нибудь чтобы это сняли.

294
00:16:40,935 --> 00:16:43,723
Да ладно, раз уж висит. Оставь как есть.
А где Кевин?

295
00:16:43,806 --> 00:16:45,793
Давай !
Давайте кататься.

296
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:50,793
Да не волнуйся,
все в порядке.

297
00:16:56,688 --> 00:16:58,330
- Я хочу...
- Поворачивай направо.

298
00:16:58,516 --> 00:17:00,852
-Думаешь можешь отпустить мою руку?
- Нет.

299
00:17:05,248 --> 00:17:06,952
Это что, Майкл?

300
00:17:07,155 --> 00:17:09,421
Да, я всю жизнь очень
неплохо катался.

301
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:11,492
Даже подумывал о карьере в NHL.

302
00:17:11,548 --> 00:17:13,730
Но пришлось бы постоянно разъезжать.

303
00:17:13,826 --> 00:17:16,112
Не было бы времени для жены и детей.

304
00:17:16,508 --> 00:17:19,131
А я очень хочу жену и детей.

305
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:26,360
У меня получается!

306
00:17:26,706 --> 00:17:31,210
Эй Пэм, то что случилось с Кевином, это действительно страшно.

307
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,383
Так что, когда будешь в душе...

308
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:37,320
осмотри себя как следует.
Знаешь, просто проверь.

309
00:17:37,507 --> 00:17:39,882
Все эти болезни... они расползаются как букашки.

310
00:17:40,065 --> 00:17:42,581
Ладно? Просто не забудь.

311
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:46,592
Да, есть о чем подумать.

312
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,772
- Никак не могу успокоиться...
- Кевин.

313
00:17:50,357 --> 00:17:52,333
- Есть что-нибудь?
- Еще нет.

314
00:17:52,465 --> 00:17:54,230
Ладно. Ну, крепись.

315
00:17:54,376 --> 00:17:56,011
- Хорошо, Майкл
- Майкл?

316
00:17:56,106 --> 00:17:57,760
Да. Кэрол?

317
00:17:58,137 --> 00:18:00,282
- Да.
- Она продала мне квартиру.

318
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:03,331
Эй, это место тоже продается...?

319
00:18:04,536 --> 00:18:07,231
Нет. Я же не все время продаю.

320
00:18:07,335 --> 00:18:08,791
Моя дочь учится кататься.

321
00:18:08,937 --> 00:18:10,623
О, это все твои дети?

322
00:18:10,788 --> 00:18:12,352
Нет, только двое.

323
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,140
Эй, ребята. Как дела?
Хотите прокатиться?

324
00:18:15,225 --> 00:18:16,962
- Можно?
- Конечно.

325
00:18:17,076 --> 00:18:19,292
Отлично. Так.
Хватайтесь.

326
00:18:19,487 --> 00:18:22,551
Готовы? Держитесь крепче. Поехали.

327
00:18:23,087 --> 00:18:26,772
- Мы движемся.
- Вот теперь мы действительно движемся.

328
00:18:31,785 --> 00:18:34,763
<i>Отталкивайся.
Круто. Отлично. Теперь получается.</i>

329
00:18:35,428 --> 00:18:36,852
Простите.

330
00:18:39,027 --> 00:18:42,372
Алло. Да, хорошо.

331
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:45,980
Хорошо.

332
00:18:47,405 --> 00:18:49,672
Да. Обязательно. Спасибо.

333
00:18:50,975 --> 00:18:53,322
Отрицательный.

334
00:19:02,106 --> 00:19:05,850
Мы же переживем это... да?
Мы... иди сюда.

335
00:19:07,997 --> 00:19:11,120
Ну, как оказалось,
отрицательный, в медицине,

336
00:19:11,206 --> 00:19:14,921
значит «хорошо», что
абсолютно бессмысленно.

337
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:20,461
Если бы так было во всем обществе, начался бы хаос.

338
00:19:21,457 --> 00:19:24,133
Потрясающе.

339
00:19:24,477 --> 00:19:26,831
Спасибо, парни.

340
00:19:27,405 --> 00:19:29,872
Так, от кого это?

341
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:36,161
- О, вы только гляньте. Свитер.
- Переверни его.

342
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:37,503
- Переверни.
- Круто.

343
00:19:39,338 --> 00:19:40,200
Отлично.

344
00:19:40,365 --> 00:19:42,583
- Спасибо, Дуайт.
- «От Дуайта. Номер 1» !

345
00:19:42,687 --> 00:19:44,182
- Отлично, спасибо.
- Майкл.

346
00:19:44,636 --> 00:19:47,950
- Это от всех нас.
- Не стоило.

347
00:19:50,976 --> 00:19:54,991
«Ночные объятия». Это невероятно.

348
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:57,642
Спасибо. Мне нравится.

349
00:19:58,076 --> 00:20:00,762
День Рождения Майкла оказался
довольно-таки классным.

350
00:20:01,627 --> 00:20:03,313
Хороший день.

351
00:20:03,437 --> 00:20:04,953
Я не знаю.

352
00:20:05,535 --> 00:20:07,361
Это был хороший день.

<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

1
00:00:00,816 --> 00:00:02,615
Kevin Malone, you're next.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:03,648
Spit that out.

3
00:00:05,032 --> 00:00:07,859
Spit...
Okay, come on. Let's go.

4
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:13,448
You look cute today, Dwight.

5
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:15,677
Thanks, girl.

6
00:00:18,903 --> 00:00:22,199
So, yesterday, Dwight found
half a joint in the parking lot.

7
00:00:22,281 --> 00:00:24,541
<i>Which is unfortunate,
because, as it turns out,</i>

8
00:00:24,588 --> 00:00:26,605
<i>Dwight finding a drugs
is more dangerous</i>

9
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:28,448
<i>than most people using drugs.</i>

10
00:00:28,507 --> 00:00:31,700
Let's go over some of the symptoms
of marijuana use.

11
00:00:31,763 --> 00:00:32,846
Shall we ?

12
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:35,800
You tell me who this sounds like.

13
00:00:36,006 --> 00:00:37,876
Slow moving.

14
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:40,042
Inattentive.

15
00:00:40,456 --> 00:00:41,490
Dull.

16
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,473
Constantly snacking.

17
00:00:45,168 --> 00:00:48,073
Shows a lack of motivation.

18
00:00:52,477 --> 00:00:54,723
I like the people
I work with, generally.

19
00:00:54,976 --> 00:00:56,522
With four exceptions.

20
00:00:56,997 --> 00:00:59,191
But someone committed a crime.

21
00:00:59,277 --> 00:01:01,013
And I did not become
a Lackawanna County

22
00:01:01,058 --> 00:01:03,140
Volunteer Sheriff's
Deputy to make friends.

23
00:01:04,276 --> 00:01:06,313
And by the way, I haven't.

24
00:01:31,627 --> 00:01:33,650
Episode 20 - Season 2

27
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:41,780
I enjoy the tangy zip,

28
00:01:42,037 --> 00:01:43,471
of Miracle Whip.

29
00:01:44,657 --> 00:01:46,701
Jim does the best impressions.

30
00:01:46,817 --> 00:01:48,741
Sometimes he'll look up
at me from his desk

31
00:01:48,787 --> 00:01:50,181
and he'll just be someone else.

32
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:52,263
Like, he'll go...

33
00:01:58,788 --> 00:02:00,480
That's supposed to be Phyllis.

34
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:02,671
I can't do it as good as he can.

35
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:05,262
And the guys are saying,
"Chug chug chug."

36
00:02:05,377 --> 00:02:07,201
But I'm so small
and all I'd eaten that day

37
00:02:07,237 --> 00:02:09,852
was one of those Auntie Annes's
pretzels from the food court.

38
00:02:09,936 --> 00:02:12,042
So I said,
"Is it okay if I sip it ?"

39
00:02:12,177 --> 00:02:14,500
And they said no.
But Ryan seemed cool either way.

40
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:15,631
Stop!

41
00:02:16,126 --> 00:02:18,190
This is no Kelly Kapour story hour.

42
00:02:19,068 --> 00:02:22,700
Illegal drugs were consumed
on company property, okay ?

43
00:02:23,016 --> 00:02:25,122
Your ass is on the line, Mister!

44
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:26,962
My ass is on the line!

45
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:28,511
Now, I'm going to ask you again.

46
00:02:28,987 --> 00:02:31,901
What time did you go home
last night ?

47
00:02:32,697 --> 00:02:33,732
6:00.

48
00:02:40,798 --> 00:02:43,151
I didn't know you were
at a party on Saturday night.

49
00:02:43,525 --> 00:02:45,842
I go to a lot of parties.

50
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:48,421
Okay, I'm gonna need to search
your car. Give me your keys.

51
00:02:48,476 --> 00:02:50,130
I am not giving you my keys.

52
00:02:50,226 --> 00:02:51,842
Don't make me do this the hard way.

53
00:02:51,986 --> 00:02:53,103
What's the hard way ?

54
00:02:53,787 --> 00:02:56,150
I go down to the police station
on my lunch break.

55
00:02:56,258 --> 00:02:57,582
I tell a police officer...

56
00:02:57,907 --> 00:02:58,960
I know several.

57
00:02:59,025 --> 00:03:00,913
What I may suspect
you may have in your car.

58
00:03:00,968 --> 00:03:03,730
He requests a hearing from a judge
and obtains a search warrant.

59
00:03:03,856 --> 00:03:06,530
Once he has said warrant,
he will drive over here

60
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:09,113
and make you give him
the keys to your car.

61
00:03:09,295 --> 00:03:11,291
And you will have to obey him.

62
00:03:12,048 --> 00:03:13,223
Yeah, let's do it that way.

63
00:03:13,285 --> 00:03:14,940
Ryan, is he bugging you ?

64
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:17,671
Dwight, dude, you gotta take
a chill pill, man.

65
00:03:17,726 --> 00:03:20,660
It was one joint in
the parking lot,  you know ?

66
00:03:20,705 --> 00:03:24,062
You're...you're totally
harshing the office mellow.

67
00:03:24,268 --> 00:03:26,221
I can't stop this investigation.
It is my job.

68
00:03:26,675 --> 00:03:29,271
- You are a volunteer.
- I volunteered for this job.

69
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:30,302
And that's not the same.

70
00:03:30,355 --> 00:03:31,862
- It is my duty...
- Volunteer duty.

71
00:03:31,895 --> 00:03:34,871
To investigate the crime scene.
I have six more interviews to go,

72
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:37,482
and then I will reveal what I know.

73
00:03:37,848 --> 00:03:38,873
Narc!

74
00:03:40,408 --> 00:03:42,073
If  you are attempting
to compliment me,

75
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:43,542
then you have done a very good job.

76
00:03:43,576 --> 00:03:45,201
I wasn't attempting
to compliment you.

77
00:03:45,237 --> 00:03:46,802
Well, you have.
Because being a narc

78
00:03:46,868 --> 00:03:48,771
is one of the hardest jobs
that you can have.

79
00:03:48,806 --> 00:03:51,681
- And I am very proud of being a narc.
- Why don't you just cool it ?

80
00:03:51,736 --> 00:03:54,132
Cool it, Dwight, please ? God.
Dude, where's my office ?

81
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,643
I totally lost it.

82
00:03:56,055 --> 00:03:57,791
'Cause I was half...baked!

83
00:03:57,918 --> 00:03:59,453
Smoking doobies!

84
00:03:59,836 --> 00:04:03,300
Doobie Brothers. I was smoking
doobies with my brothers.

85
00:04:03,747 --> 00:04:05,753
Peace out Seacrest!

86
00:04:07,655 --> 00:04:09,233
Well, your office is behind you.

87
00:04:09,295 --> 00:04:10,361
Thanks.

88
00:04:10,605 --> 00:04:12,013
Munchies.

89
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:13,591
Who wants some munchies ?

90
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:15,830
I don't think Michael's
ever done drugs.

91
00:04:17,026 --> 00:04:19,740
I don't know if anyone's
ever offered him any.

92
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:22,490
<i>Oscar visited Mexico
when he was five</i>

93
00:04:22,527 --> 00:04:24,383
<i>to attend his great
grandmother's funeral.</i>

94
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:26,123
<i>What does that mean</i>

95
00:04:26,186 --> 00:04:28,211
<i>to the United States
law enforcement officer ?</i>

96
00:04:29,396 --> 00:04:30,820
He'a a potential drug mule.

97
00:04:31,427 --> 00:04:33,471
Have you ever taken
any illegal drugs ?

98
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:34,573
No, I have not.

99
00:04:34,616 --> 00:04:36,231
Do you think it's possible that

100
00:04:36,278 --> 00:04:38,772
maybe you could have had
some drugs in your system

101
00:04:38,817 --> 00:04:40,653
without you knowing about it ?

102
00:04:41,696 --> 00:04:43,190
What are you implying ?

103
00:04:43,395 --> 00:04:45,293
Have you ever...

104
00:04:46,247 --> 00:04:47,573
pooped...

105
00:04:48,227 --> 00:04:49,701
a balloon ?

106
00:04:52,046 --> 00:04:54,412
Okay, I'm done with this.

107
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:02,513
He sure left in a hurry.

108
00:05:03,517 --> 00:05:04,641
I don't want to blow this.

109
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,531
<i>This is what all good law
enforcement officers dream of.</i>

110
00:05:07,626 --> 00:05:10,152
<i>The  chance to solve
an actual crime.</i>

111
00:05:11,886 --> 00:05:13,941
Do you know what this is ?

112
00:05:14,197 --> 00:05:15,613
Yes, it's marijuana.

113
00:05:15,827 --> 00:05:17,320
How do you know that ?

114
00:05:17,897 --> 00:05:18,893
It's labeled.

115
00:05:21,026 --> 00:05:22,052
Dammit.

116
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:27,041
That, is Northern Lights
Cannabis Indica.

117
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,142
It's marijuana.

118
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,672
I'm just saying that you can't
be sure that it wasn't you.

119
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,652
That's ridiculous,
of course it wasn't me.

120
00:05:36,706 --> 00:05:38,690
Marijuana is a memory loss drug.

121
00:05:38,736 --> 00:05:40,103
So maybe you just don't remember.

122
00:05:40,126 --> 00:05:41,230
I would remember.

123
00:05:41,327 --> 00:05:43,442
Well, how could you if it just
erased your memory ?

124
00:05:43,495 --> 00:05:46,261
- That's not how it works.
- Now, how do you know how it works ?

125
00:05:46,426 --> 00:05:48,370
Knock it off, okay.
Now I'm interviewing you.

126
00:05:48,426 --> 00:05:50,510
No, you said that I'd be 
conducting the interview

127
00:05:50,546 --> 00:05:51,453
when I walked in here.

128
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,513
Now, exactly how much
pot did you smoke ?!

129
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:58,070
So, Pam told me you do
a great Stanley impression.

130
00:05:58,118 --> 00:05:59,220
I'd love to hear it.

131
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:06,872
Why do you keep CC'ing me on things
that have nothing to do with me ?

132
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:10,942
Is that supposed to be me ?

133
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,010
Oh, hey, Stanley.

134
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,880
I was just doing an impression.

135
00:06:13,938 --> 00:06:16,012
I do not think that is funny.

136
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,752
He  does everyone in the office.

137
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:28,792
"I do not think that is funny."

138
00:06:29,075 --> 00:06:30,191
Jinx, buy me a coke.

139
00:06:30,705 --> 00:06:31,871
No no no. No talking.

140
00:06:35,976 --> 00:06:38,832
Jim is not allowed to talk
until after he buys me a coke.

141
00:06:39,177 --> 00:06:42,033
Those are the rules of Jinx.
And they are unflinchingly rigid.

142
00:06:50,336 --> 00:06:54,302
Sold out! That has never
happened in the history of Jinx!

143
00:06:54,576 --> 00:06:55,690
"Come on."

144
00:06:56,023 --> 00:06:57,546
Sorry, that's not my problem.

145
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:07,920
I know you're innocent.

146
00:07:07,976 --> 00:07:10,416
But I can't look like I'm treating
you any differently.

147
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,213
I understand.

148
00:07:13,386 --> 00:07:15,401
Where were you yesterday
after work ?

149
00:07:18,587 --> 00:07:20,893
Who's he calling ?
Rattin' somebody out.

150
00:07:20,956 --> 00:07:22,190
Narc.

151
00:07:22,346 --> 00:07:23,422
Narc!

152
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:25,901
- Kevin.
- That is so good, Michael.

153
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:26,950
Remember the narc bit ?

154
00:07:27,757 --> 00:07:29,103
Okay, I will let them know.

155
00:07:30,277 --> 00:07:32,021
- Attention everyone.
- Who's in trouble ?

156
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:36,063
Drug testers are coming in a couple
hours to test everyone's urine.

157
00:07:37,717 --> 00:07:39,610
What ? What are you talking about ?

158
00:07:39,656 --> 00:07:41,953
Company policy.
If drugs are found on the premises,

159
00:07:42,065 --> 00:07:45,762
there is automatic drug testing
conducted within 24 hours.

160
00:07:46,205 --> 00:07:47,433
Is that true, Toby ?

161
00:07:47,827 --> 00:07:49,731
When you sign your job application

162
00:07:49,775 --> 00:07:52,100
you agree to comply
with random drug testing.

163
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:57,262
<i>Two nights ago, I went to
an Alicia Keys concert...</i>

164
00:07:57,338 --> 00:07:59,362
at the Montage Mountain
Performing Arts Center.

165
00:07:59,406 --> 00:08:01,023
I had scored these great
aisle seats.

166
00:08:01,078 --> 00:08:02,780
Anyway, after the opening act,

167
00:08:02,826 --> 00:08:04,620
this beautiful girl
sits down next to me.

168
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:06,763
And I never get to meet
girls with lip rings.

169
00:08:06,785 --> 00:08:07,851
And she had one.

170
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,131
I don't know exatcly
how this happened,

171
00:08:10,227 --> 00:08:13,523
but one of her friends started
passing around some stuff.

172
00:08:13,546 --> 00:08:15,363
And they said that
it was clove cigarettes.

173
00:08:15,385 --> 00:08:17,391
And I'm sure that
it was clove cigarettes.

174
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:19,171
Everybody in the aisle
was doing it.

175
00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:21,553
Okay, attention, everyone.

176
00:08:21,736 --> 00:08:23,833
The drug testing
has been cancelled.

177
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,371
Instead I will be going
around to each of you

178
00:08:26,726 --> 00:08:28,472
and doing a visual inspection.

179
00:08:28,527 --> 00:08:31,041
- No, you can't do that.
- I can do that.  It is my office.

180
00:08:31,188 --> 00:08:33,822
No, you cannot.
It has to be official.

181
00:08:34,008 --> 00:08:36,060
And it has to be urine.

182
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,392
All right.

183
00:08:50,765 --> 00:08:54,170
Kevin, what prescription drugs
are you taking besides Rogaine ?

184
00:08:55,216 --> 00:08:56,870
I'm not taking Rogaine.

185
00:08:57,577 --> 00:08:58,842
Angela, what about you ?

186
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,902
I don't take any
prescription drugs.

187
00:09:01,257 --> 00:09:03,901
You're not... on... anything ?

188
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:07,962
Good.

189
00:09:11,315 --> 00:09:13,032
So, the first time
we went out to dinner,

190
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:14,411
it was like, whatever, fine.

191
00:09:14,496 --> 00:09:16,000
But I was so nervous.

192
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:18,513
So this time I want it
to be special.

193
00:09:18,618 --> 00:09:19,900
So, I bought a new dress!

194
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:22,110
One of those kinds that's kind
of low cut at the top

195
00:09:22,157 --> 00:09:23,903
to show some things,
but not everything.

196
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:26,123
I mean, not everything, Jim.
I promise,

197
00:09:26,195 --> 00:09:28,350
- I'm not a...
- Hey guys, what's going on ?

198
00:09:28,425 --> 00:09:30,620
Oh, we're just having
the best conversation.

199
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:34,071
Okay, well, Michael wants to see
everyone in the conference room.

200
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:36,943
But you know what ?
We have a few minutes.

201
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:39,633
So you guys should definitely
finish up your conversation.

202
00:09:39,718 --> 00:09:40,950
Cool, thanks.

203
00:09:43,036 --> 00:09:46,070
So, I was looking so hot...

204
00:09:46,538 --> 00:09:48,321
It has come to my attention,

205
00:09:49,065 --> 00:09:53,211
that some people here
think the use of drugs

206
00:09:53,857 --> 00:09:55,573
is something to laugh about.

207
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,810
- We don't feel that way.
- No, not at all.

208
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,172
You were the one joking around
calling Dwight a narc.

209
00:10:02,107 --> 00:10:04,442
That was a test. I was testing you.

210
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,302
And you all failed.

211
00:10:07,376 --> 00:10:08,580
Miserably.

212
00:10:08,677 --> 00:10:12,523
When I said that Dwight was a narc,
how many of you defended him ?

213
00:10:12,565 --> 00:10:15,120
How many of you said,
"Hey, you know what ? He's right."

214
00:10:15,176 --> 00:10:19,512
"What he's doing is protecting
this office from the evils of drugs" ?

215
00:10:19,607 --> 00:10:20,811
Thank you, Michael.

216
00:10:20,855 --> 00:10:22,481
I am ridiculously anti-drug.

217
00:10:22,587 --> 00:10:25,973
I am so anti-drug that
I am above suspicion

218
00:10:26,007 --> 00:10:28,082
in any way that involves
suspicion...

219
00:10:28,477 --> 00:10:30,620
or testing of any kind.

220
00:10:30,925 --> 00:10:33,390
Drugs ruin lives, people.

221
00:10:33,585 --> 00:10:36,382
Drugs destroy careers.

222
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:37,961
Take Cheech and Chong.

223
00:10:37,985 --> 00:10:40,773
Everybody knows that
Cheech and Chong are funny.

224
00:10:40,825 --> 00:10:43,893
But just imagine how funny they
would be if they didn't smoke pot.

225
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:47,281
I want everybody to take
a look to their left.

226
00:10:48,755 --> 00:10:51,123
Now I want everybody to take
a look to their right.

227
00:10:52,348 --> 00:10:55,482
One of those people will be dead

228
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:59,012
from drug use at some point
in their lives.

229
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:03,083
This year, more people
will use cocaine

230
00:11:03,188 --> 00:11:05,352
than will read a book
to their children.

231
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:07,071
Where did you get these facts ?

232
00:11:07,145 --> 00:11:09,523
Are these facts scaring you ?
Or are they not ?

233
00:11:09,608 --> 00:11:10,611
They are not.

234
00:11:10,677 --> 00:11:13,831
Do  you think that smoking
drugs is cool ?

235
00:11:13,988 --> 00:11:16,430
Do you think that doing
alcohol is cool ?

236
00:11:16,557 --> 00:11:19,013
No, I don't.
I have about a glass of red wine

237
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,500
with dinner about once a week.

238
00:11:20,977 --> 00:11:22,301
For the antioxidants.

239
00:11:22,646 --> 00:11:24,483
Okay, enough. Enough. Enough!

240
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:29,670
I have written down
a list of illegal drugs.

241
00:11:30,415 --> 00:11:33,223
Take a gander. How many of these
are you familiar with ?

242
00:11:33,655 --> 00:11:35,863
Hookah is not an illegal drug,
Michael.

243
00:11:35,927 --> 00:11:37,843
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

244
00:11:38,326 --> 00:11:39,523
It's a type of pipe.

245
00:11:40,248 --> 00:11:43,460
You can fill it with tobacco,
often mixed with fruit, or flavored...

246
00:11:43,507 --> 00:11:45,223
Okay, you know what, Toby ?

247
00:11:45,525 --> 00:11:46,850
Pam, could you take this down ?

248
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,591
In addition to Toby's
urine being tested,

249
00:11:49,645 --> 00:11:51,542
I would like to test his blood
and his hair.

250
00:11:51,705 --> 00:11:54,793
- You can't do that.
- I can test anyone randomly.

251
00:11:54,858 --> 00:11:56,801
And I have chosen you, randomly.

252
00:11:56,926 --> 00:11:59,192
- That's not random.
- Okay. Eenie, meanie, miney...

253
00:11:59,238 --> 00:12:00,750
moe. Is random.

254
00:12:01,848 --> 00:12:02,872
Okay, you know what ?

255
00:12:02,897 --> 00:12:05,603
I'm gonna need a volunteer
to select one of these words.

256
00:12:05,866 --> 00:12:09,292
And tell us of something... tragic

257
00:12:09,755 --> 00:12:12,953
that happened in either their lives
or the lives of a loved one.

258
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:15,700
Yeah, Pam.

259
00:12:16,518 --> 00:12:20,432
I know that Jim has an amazing
story about a relative of his

260
00:12:20,668 --> 00:12:22,732
who got caught up
in the world of drugs.

261
00:12:22,797 --> 00:12:24,011
Really ?

262
00:12:24,746 --> 00:12:26,393
Jim, it's okay. You can...

263
00:12:28,556 --> 00:12:30,642
This would be a good
place to let it out, Jim.

264
00:12:31,048 --> 00:12:34,123
These are people you can trust.
These are people who care about you.

265
00:12:34,445 --> 00:12:37,113
It's okay. Just...
we will not judge you.

266
00:12:37,546 --> 00:12:39,100
We are here to not judge you.

267
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:40,453
Oh, he's doing it, okay.

268
00:12:46,827 --> 00:12:47,861
It's okay.

269
00:12:56,798 --> 00:12:57,612
"I can't."

270
00:13:02,838 --> 00:13:03,920
Okay, you sure ?

271
00:13:04,427 --> 00:13:06,220
That looked like
it was going to be good.

272
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:08,412
All right.

273
00:13:08,568 --> 00:13:09,643
Okay, well...

274
00:13:11,306 --> 00:13:13,773
He really pulled out the big guns.

275
00:13:14,045 --> 00:13:15,251
Fake crying.

276
00:13:16,335 --> 00:13:17,643
Did not expect that.

277
00:13:19,346 --> 00:13:23,502
The point I'm trying to make
with all of this, people,

278
00:13:23,577 --> 00:13:27,143
is that I hate drugs.
I hate them.

279
00:13:28,106 --> 00:13:30,351
And based upon what I have seen,

280
00:13:30,406 --> 00:13:33,262
you all don't quite hate 'em
as much as I do.

281
00:13:33,328 --> 00:13:37,412
So you are going to have 
a drug test. And I am not.

282
00:13:37,766 --> 00:13:40,173
- No, you will be tested.
- Yes, I... no, will not be.

283
00:13:40,326 --> 00:13:43,102
You will be. That is the law
according to the rules.

284
00:13:43,495 --> 00:13:46,971
Okay. Well, Dwight, just know...
that I've been very busy today.

285
00:13:47,728 --> 00:13:49,352
And I've got a lot of work to do.

286
00:13:49,398 --> 00:13:51,393
And I wasn't planning
on going to the bathroom.

287
00:13:51,446 --> 00:13:53,970
And I don't even know if
anything's gonna come out, okay ?

288
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,461
So, good. Thank you.

289
00:13:58,227 --> 00:14:01,110
Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute.
Assistant Regional Manager.

290
00:14:02,266 --> 00:14:04,470
You  might remember testing
my urine a few years back

291
00:14:04,525 --> 00:14:06,901
when I was applying to be a
Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy.

292
00:14:07,196 --> 00:14:09,163
We test a lot of urine.

293
00:14:09,385 --> 00:14:10,731
Mine was green.

294
00:14:11,908 --> 00:14:13,250
Oh, right.

295
00:14:14,195 --> 00:14:15,973
- How are you ?
- I'm all better.

296
00:14:16,066 --> 00:14:18,511
So, I need you to do some work
on the St. Andrew's account.

297
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,832
I need your urine.

298
00:14:19,965 --> 00:14:21,592
I need some filing done...

299
00:14:21,635 --> 00:14:23,251
- What kind of filing ?
- That just...

300
00:14:23,467 --> 00:14:25,061
forget it. Just the urine.

301
00:14:25,128 --> 00:14:27,591
That goes directly to the tester.

302
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:29,030
Just...

303
00:14:35,146 --> 00:14:36,530
I need your urine.

304
00:14:39,766 --> 00:14:41,881
- Like in a cup ?
- Yes, in a cup.

305
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:44,190
- We're not animals, Dwight.
- For what purpose ?

306
00:14:44,955 --> 00:14:46,143
It's none of your business.

307
00:14:46,207 --> 00:14:48,511
- Then I refuse.
- Okay, all right. Just...

308
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,191
I went to an Alicia Keys concert.

309
00:14:52,005 --> 00:14:53,361
Over the weekend.

310
00:14:54,866 --> 00:14:57,190
And I think that
I may have gotten high

311
00:14:57,245 --> 00:15:00,843
accidentally by
a girl with a lip ring.

312
00:15:01,878 --> 00:15:03,352
Are you serious ?

313
00:15:06,895 --> 00:15:10,913
I need clean urine for the lady.

314
00:15:15,137 --> 00:15:16,463
But that's illegal.

315
00:15:16,647 --> 00:15:18,761
Don't think of it that way.
It's like...

316
00:15:19,788 --> 00:15:21,872
urine goes all over
the place, you know ?

317
00:15:21,928 --> 00:15:23,720
There's no controlling it.
It just...

318
00:15:24,026 --> 00:15:24,941
Not my urine.

319
00:15:24,976 --> 00:15:26,930
A cup could find its way
under the urine.

320
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,051
It might be an accident.

321
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,812
Were you forced to do
drugs at this concert ?

322
00:15:30,858 --> 00:15:32,222
- Just...
- Is something wrong ?

323
00:15:32,258 --> 00:15:33,341
Just... look, just...

324
00:15:36,347 --> 00:15:38,631
just fill up the cup.

325
00:15:44,017 --> 00:15:46,351
Do you want to give
Michael your urine ?

326
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:51,151
I want him to have
all the urine he needs.

327
00:15:51,988 --> 00:15:53,792
You're not gonna get
my permission on this.

328
00:15:53,866 --> 00:15:55,910
I know that.
Don't you think I know that ?

329
00:15:59,055 --> 00:16:01,621
Yeah, we do testing
all over the country.

330
00:16:01,867 --> 00:16:02,983
Cool.

331
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:04,843
Hey, are you guys hiring ?

332
00:16:05,406 --> 00:16:07,903
You wanna work
at the urinalysis lab ?

333
00:16:09,417 --> 00:16:10,652
Yeah, maybe.

334
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,851
My father's name was
Dwight Schrute.

335
00:16:20,465 --> 00:16:24,110
<i>My grandfather's name
was Dwight Schrute.</i>

336
00:16:25,358 --> 00:16:27,570
<i>His father's name ?</i>

337
00:16:27,675 --> 00:16:30,021
<i>Dwiged Schrued.</i>

338
00:16:31,085 --> 00:16:32,400
<i>Amish.</i>

339
00:16:38,266 --> 00:16:40,052
<i>I loved my father very much.</i>

340
00:16:40,596 --> 00:16:44,663
<i>Every morning he'd wake up at dawn
and make us biscuits with gravy.</i>

341
00:16:45,248 --> 00:16:48,290
When I was little, my dad and I
played a lot of games together.

342
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:51,081
<i>My dad cheated a lot,
but I never busted him on it.</i>

343
00:16:51,658 --> 00:16:54,062
<i>I would have,
except I didn't know about it.</i>

344
00:16:54,136 --> 00:16:57,213
<i>He didn't tell me 'til years later.
I was shocked when I found out.</i>

345
00:17:00,295 --> 00:17:01,390
What ?

346
00:17:02,378 --> 00:17:03,850
Did you wanna tell me something ?

347
00:17:03,905 --> 00:17:06,020
You look like you wanna
tell me something.

348
00:17:06,408 --> 00:17:09,000
You look like you have something
really important to say

349
00:17:09,036 --> 00:17:10,863
and you just can't for some reason.

350
00:17:13,007 --> 00:17:14,701
Come on, you can tell me.

351
00:17:15,478 --> 00:17:17,680
Jim, you can tell me anything.

352
00:17:54,635 --> 00:17:56,222
I'd like a magazine.

353
00:17:56,398 --> 00:17:58,091
We just need urine, sir.

354
00:17:58,155 --> 00:17:59,271
I'd still like one.

355
00:18:00,975 --> 00:18:02,133
Dwight.

356
00:18:02,328 --> 00:18:05,322
Well, I passed the test,

357
00:18:05,355 --> 00:18:08,001
thanks to you and
your untainted pee.

358
00:18:08,278 --> 00:18:09,673
Thank you very much. 

359
00:18:09,746 --> 00:18:11,600
- That's great.
- What's wrong ?

360
00:18:12,545 --> 00:18:14,893
- Where's your costume ?
- It's a uniform.

361
00:18:15,407 --> 00:18:17,951
And I turned it in today
when I tendered my resignation.

362
00:18:18,195 --> 00:18:19,223
Why ? What...

363
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:21,840
I took an oath when I was sworn in.

364
00:18:23,607 --> 00:18:25,410
And I broke that oath today.

365
00:18:43,296 --> 00:18:44,412
Here.

366
00:18:45,766 --> 00:18:46,931
Just  buy it from me.

367
00:18:48,688 --> 00:18:51,111
I haven't talked to you in hours,
and it's been weird.

368
00:18:51,235 --> 00:18:54,041
And I really wanna know what
the hell's going on with Dwight.

369
00:19:08,227 --> 00:19:09,513
- Hi.
- Hey.

370
00:19:09,885 --> 00:19:11,810
How much time do you have left
on your break ?

371
00:19:11,908 --> 00:19:13,022
10 minutes.

372
00:19:15,577 --> 00:19:19,171
Since you did such a good job
with the investigation

373
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:23,183
I decided to pull a few strings,
call in a few favors.

374
00:19:23,677 --> 00:19:25,101
And I've decided to make you

375
00:19:25,168 --> 00:19:27,640
Official Security
Supervisor of the branch.

376
00:19:29,675 --> 00:19:30,841
- Really ?
- Yes, sir.

377
00:19:30,956 --> 00:19:32,732
That's fantastic.
'Cause I've always felt

378
00:19:32,777 --> 00:19:34,061
that the security here sucked.

379
00:19:35,928 --> 00:19:37,090
So, you wanna...

380
00:19:40,355 --> 00:19:41,543
"Dwight K. Schrute,

381
00:19:41,975 --> 00:19:44,623
I hereby declare you
an honorary volunteer corporal

382
00:19:44,665 --> 00:19:47,433
in charge of assisting
all activity security."

383
00:19:49,347 --> 00:19:51,243
- Good, okay.
- Here's your badge.

384
00:19:52,727 --> 00:19:54,030
Thank you, Michael.

385
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:58,092
Very nice. Great.
Can I have a gun ?

386
00:19:58,796 --> 00:20:00,272
No. I don't have a gun.

387
00:20:01,985 --> 00:20:03,970
Okay.
I'll have to bring my bo staff.

388
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:05,953
I don't think so.

389
00:20:06,296 --> 00:20:07,350
Don't.

390
00:20:07,895 --> 00:20:09,653
- Good.
- Thank you, Michael.

391
00:20:14,196 --> 00:20:15,930
I need to go over
some details with you.

392
00:20:15,986 --> 00:20:17,330
- All right...
- First of all...

393
00:20:17,376 --> 00:20:18,413
Thank you.

394
00:20:19,188 --> 00:20:21,290
How many orange traffic cones
do you have ?

395
00:20:22,217 --> 00:20:24,680
- Two.
- Oh... God.

396
00:20:25,775 --> 00:20:28,611
What a terrible day
to not be able to talk.

397
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,841
Dwight was literally
carrying around his own urine

398
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:32,752
and dressed like
one of the Village People.

399
00:20:32,806 --> 00:20:35,073
Why does he do the things
that he does for Michael ?

400
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,363
I just don't get it.

401
00:20:36,427 --> 00:20:39,280
What is he getting out
of that relationship ?



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

1
00:00:05,352 --> 00:00:08,841
So, you found a band yet
for your wedding ?

2
00:00:09,691 --> 00:00:12,643
'Cause I'm in a band.
We really rock.

3
00:00:12,703 --> 00:00:14,294
Yeah, I mean, it's inevitable.

4
00:00:14,428 --> 00:00:17,380
I definitely overhear some wedding
preparation, but I'm fine with it.

5
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,437
She hears me arranging
my social life...

6
00:00:20,526 --> 00:00:24,194
and we both have to hear Dwight
order deer urine over the internet,

7
00:00:24,328 --> 00:00:25,744
so it evens out.

8
00:00:26,479 --> 00:00:27,597
So I got the Save The Date.

9
00:00:27,641 --> 00:00:29,121
- Yeah ?
- Yeah, pretty stationary.

10
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,100
- Oh, thanks.
- I didn't get mine yet.

11
00:00:35,901 --> 00:00:38,495
There are a few people
I decided not to invite.

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,122
And that might make things
kind of awkward, but...

13
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,014
it's my wedding.

14
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:49,129
And I don't want anyone there
who has called me a hussy.

15
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:15,293
Episode 21 - Season 2
Conflict resolution

18
00:01:22,126 --> 00:01:25,235
Yes, thanks. Fantastic Sam's.
Adult cut plus.

19
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:28,065
Comes with a shampoo and blow dry.

20
00:01:28,874 --> 00:01:30,622
We're doing I.D. photos today.

21
00:01:30,669 --> 00:01:31,901
Gotta represent.

22
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,364
On or off ?

23
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:35,748
Off.

24
00:01:37,784 --> 00:01:39,391
What is on your face ?

25
00:01:39,671 --> 00:01:41,184
Is that a disguise ?

26
00:01:41,981 --> 00:01:43,307
Excuse me.

27
00:01:44,585 --> 00:01:45,852
Clown paint.

28
00:01:46,477 --> 00:01:47,849
I.D. badges are long overdue.

29
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:49,891
Security in this office park
is a joke.

30
00:01:50,383 --> 00:01:53,632
Last year I came to work with
my spud gun in a duffel bag.

31
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,037
I sat at my desk all day

32
00:01:56,096 --> 00:01:59,389
with a rifle that shoots potatoes
at 60 pounds per square inch.

33
00:01:59,928 --> 00:02:02,298
Can you imagine if I was deranged ?

34
00:02:03,154 --> 00:02:04,315
That's a nice tie.

35
00:02:07,249 --> 00:02:09,172
Thank you. That is...

36
00:02:09,407 --> 00:02:11,096
- who makes that ?
- I don't know.

37
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:13,032
Do you mind if I wear that
for the photo ?

38
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,527
Let's... let's keep our clothes.

39
00:02:17,649 --> 00:02:18,951
<i>It's like child abuse!</i>

40
00:02:20,582 --> 00:02:23,502
<i>I say, if Jesus saw that,
he'd freak out!</i>

41
00:02:23,678 --> 00:02:25,027
<i>He'd freak out, Toby.</i>

42
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:27,616
<i>I mean, on so many levels!
And I'm supposed to work there!</i>

43
00:02:27,686 --> 00:02:30,326
- I'm supposed to...
- What's the deal... e... o ?

44
00:02:30,595 --> 00:02:32,144
Just letting Oscar vent a little.

45
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:34,959
We would use the break room,
but the photographer's back there.

46
00:02:35,018 --> 00:02:36,607
- What's the problem ?
- Angela.

47
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:40,642
It's just a little dispute over
a poster in their workspace.

48
00:02:40,712 --> 00:02:43,352
- Since Christmas.
- So what, you're having a little spat ?

49
00:02:43,645 --> 00:02:45,100
I forget, are you guys dating ?

50
00:02:45,627 --> 00:02:49,076
Michael, can I talk to you
for a second, please ?

51
00:02:49,776 --> 00:02:52,556
Here's how I usually handle this.
All I do is listen.

52
00:02:52,626 --> 00:02:55,353
You know, these things just have
a way of working themselves out.

53
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,208
It's like if you write someone
a letter when you're really angry.

54
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:00,449
They say to keep it in your drawer
for a couple days,

55
00:03:00,496 --> 00:03:02,232
and then you just never
end up sending it.

56
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:04,191
What do you know about
conflict resolution ?

57
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,819
Your answer to everything
is to get divorced, so...

58
00:03:06,866 --> 00:03:08,520
- Okay.
- Okay, what ?

59
00:03:08,578 --> 00:03:10,725
That was a right decision
for me and my marriage.

60
00:03:10,772 --> 00:03:13,036
Well, that's not gonna fly here
because in this office

61
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,502
it is till death do us part.

62
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:16,379
Assuming that we don't get
downsized.

63
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:17,665
Pam,

64
00:03:18,216 --> 00:03:21,255
would you get Angela and meet us
in the conference room, please ?

65
00:03:21,865 --> 00:03:24,211
A Mediator's Toolchest.

66
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:30,248
Okay, well, before we get started,
you should know

67
00:03:30,307 --> 00:03:34,002
that there are five
different styles of conflict.

68
00:03:34,236 --> 00:03:38,161
My Shaolin Temple style
defeats your Monkey Style.

69
00:03:38,223 --> 00:03:40,428
Can we go ?
I have a lot of work to do.

70
00:03:40,475 --> 00:03:41,566
This is important.

71
00:03:41,871 --> 00:03:44,463
- The first style is "lose-lose".
- What's the next one ?

72
00:03:44,484 --> 00:03:47,358
Just, hold on, please.

73
00:03:47,405 --> 00:03:51,733
Okay, if we do lose-lose,
neither of you gets what you want.

74
00:03:53,082 --> 00:03:55,088
Do you understand ?

75
00:03:55,324 --> 00:03:58,737
You... you would both lose.

76
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:01,118
Now, I need to ask you,

77
00:04:01,154 --> 00:04:04,637
do you want to pursue
a lose-lose negotiation ?

78
00:04:05,658 --> 00:04:08,944
Can we just skip to whatever
number five is ? Win-win or whatever ?

79
00:04:08,991 --> 00:04:14,246
Win-win, is number four,
and number five is win-win-win.

80
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:18,005
The important difference here is
with win-win-win, we all win.

81
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:23,169
Me too. I win for having successfully
mediated a conflict at work.

82
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,652
Okay, so this is the disputed poster.

83
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:32,426
Now, one at a time,
I want you to express your feelings

84
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,980
using "I" emotion language and
no judging, or "you" statements.

85
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:43,039
I got this poster for Christmas, and
I feel I want to see it every day.

86
00:04:43,471 --> 00:04:46,075
It makes me feel like the babies
are the true artists,

87
00:04:46,134 --> 00:04:48,351
and God has a really
cute sense of humor.

88
00:04:48,574 --> 00:04:49,899
Come on, seriously. That ?

89
00:04:49,993 --> 00:04:51,835
I don't like looking at it.

90
00:04:51,893 --> 00:04:54,873
It's creepy and in bad taste,
and it's just offensive to me.

91
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:57,976
It makes me think of the horrible,
frigid stage mothers

92
00:04:58,024 --> 00:04:59,455
who forced the babies into it.

93
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,778
It's kitsch.
It's the opposite of art.

94
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:04,032
It destroys art. It destroys souls.

95
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:06,554
This is so much more offensive
to me than hard-core porno.

96
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:08,701
- I'm talking about the kind...
- Oh my God.

97
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:14,175
Let's see if we can't just brainstorm
and find some creative alternatives

98
00:05:14,222 --> 00:05:15,513
- that are win-win.
- Win

99
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:16,955
Yes. Thank you, Pam.

100
00:05:17,002 --> 00:05:22,840
How about, Angela makes the poster
into a t-shirt which Oscar wears.

101
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:26,735
That way he can never see it,
and whenever she looks at Oscar,

102
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,724
she can see it. Win-win-win.

103
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,436
- No.
- That's... no.

104
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:33,677
Well, brainstorm. Own the solution.

105
00:05:33,853 --> 00:05:36,597
- How about I leave it up ?
- How about she takes it down ?

106
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:41,068
How about Angela can keep it up
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

107
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,083
Okay, that is called a compromise.

108
00:05:44,646 --> 00:05:47,931
And it is style three,
and it is not ideal.

109
00:05:48,001 --> 00:05:51,591
To sum up, win-win,
make the poster into a t-shirt.

110
00:05:51,704 --> 00:05:53,992
Win-lose, take the poster down.

111
00:05:54,074 --> 00:05:58,109
Compromise, Tuesdays and Thursdays.
And the answer is...

112
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,429
make the poster into a t-shirt.

113
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,719
- Win-win.
- Win.

114
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,021
- Fine.
- But...

115
00:06:04,619 --> 00:06:05,886
It is done!

116
00:06:08,924 --> 00:06:10,718
- No, you're all good.
- Great.

117
00:06:15,774 --> 00:06:19,012
Hey, Angela.
I didn't have your zip code.

118
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,399
Thanks.

119
00:06:23,546 --> 00:06:24,941
<i>It was hand-delivered.</i>

120
00:06:25,059 --> 00:06:27,569
but I did get a Save The Date
after all.

121
00:06:28,578 --> 00:06:30,337
It's not my taste.

122
00:06:30,607 --> 00:06:31,815
You solved it.

123
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,155
We can, throw that one out.

124
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:38,923
Are those all the other complaints ?

125
00:06:39,228 --> 00:06:40,683
I would like to see those please.

126
00:06:41,311 --> 00:06:44,079
- I can't do that.
- You can't do that, huh ?

127
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:47,868
Now you and I have a conflict.

128
00:06:48,126 --> 00:06:49,991
I order you to give me that file.

129
00:06:50,261 --> 00:06:51,129
That...

130
00:06:55,758 --> 00:06:57,201
There! No more conflict.

131
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,579
I had to use the win-lose on that.
It was not pretty.

132
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:02,233
All right. Is that it ?

133
00:07:09,141 --> 00:07:10,290
It's all Dwight's.

134
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:13,892
Every Friday at 4:00,  I have
a standing appointment with Dwight

135
00:07:14,068 --> 00:07:16,497
for him to file a grievance
against Jim.

136
00:07:16,544 --> 00:07:19,441
<i>I tell him that I'm sending them
to a special file in New York.</i>

137
00:07:19,934 --> 00:07:22,456
That box is the special file
in New York.

138
00:07:22,515 --> 00:07:25,423
Oh, God. All right.

139
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:27,520
Why do I have to do everything ?

140
00:07:27,626 --> 00:07:28,670
Are you sure ?

141
00:07:28,717 --> 00:07:30,500
Oh, he's sure. Just shoot.

142
00:07:34,046 --> 00:07:35,923
This, is from Kevin.

143
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,372
He says Stanley uses his
Miracle Whip without asking.

144
00:07:39,454 --> 00:07:43,325
Meredith complains that everyone
talks too loud in the morning

145
00:07:43,395 --> 00:07:45,273
and the lights are too bright.

146
00:07:45,743 --> 00:07:47,080
Creed...

147
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,889
Creed is sick of looking
at the redhead all day

148
00:07:52,018 --> 00:07:54,892
and wants a seat
facing the receptionist.

149
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,288
Nice.

150
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,358
You will notice that not one
of these complaints is against me.

151
00:08:00,945 --> 00:08:04,182
Actually, I have a separate folder
for complaints against Michael.

152
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:10,109
This is January through March
of this year.

153
00:08:13,428 --> 00:08:16,251
How many of you have at one time

154
00:08:16,369 --> 00:08:19,172
gone to Toby to complain
about another employee ?

155
00:08:20,955 --> 00:08:24,839
And, did you get what you wanted,
or were you merely listened to,

156
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,561
you forget about your problem,
and you move on ?

157
00:08:29,332 --> 00:08:32,625
That is outrageous!
I love this place...

158
00:08:33,657 --> 00:08:36,824
and it pains me to see
all of the negativity...

159
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:38,502
festering...

160
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:44,842
Today we are going to get
everything out of these files

161
00:08:44,877 --> 00:08:47,188
and into the open,
where it can be resolved.

162
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:51,304
All right, how about
the Phyllis-Angela dispute ?

163
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:54,060
- You already did me.
- That's what she said.

164
00:08:54,213 --> 00:08:58,412
The thing is, Angela,
you are in here an awful lot.

165
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,653
You have complained about
everybody in the office,

166
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,550
except Dwight, which is odd

167
00:09:02,796 --> 00:09:05,658
because  everyone else
has had run in with Dwight.

168
00:09:05,729 --> 00:09:07,746
Toby, by the way,
what does "redacted" mean ?

169
00:09:07,969 --> 00:09:10,878
There is a file full of complaints
in here marked "redacted."

170
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:14,037
It just means whoever complained
came to me later and withdrew it,

171
00:09:14,072 --> 00:09:15,550
so I took their name off.

172
00:09:17,051 --> 00:09:19,386
There were a bunch of complaints
about Dwight

173
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,943
that were put in the redacted file
about six months ago.

174
00:09:21,992 --> 00:09:24,172
Wait! If someone has
a problem with me,

175
00:09:24,232 --> 00:09:26,261
why would they withdraw it
six months ago ?

176
00:09:30,543 --> 00:09:33,073
Let's move on. I volunteer.

177
00:09:33,413 --> 00:09:34,927
Did anyone have a problem with me ?

178
00:09:34,985 --> 00:09:37,601
All right, Pamela. Come on down!

179
00:09:37,883 --> 00:09:43,047
Let's do it. And... okay.
Just one complaint.

180
00:09:43,293 --> 00:09:45,252
Actually, it has been withdrawn.

181
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,941
So that is no help to us. Next.

182
00:09:47,152 --> 00:09:48,337
Wait, what did it say ?

183
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:51,270
"Does she have to plan her wedding
on office time ?"

184
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,981
"Shouldn't she do that at home ?"

185
00:09:54,588 --> 00:09:56,054
Who else ?

186
00:09:56,289 --> 00:09:59,585
Why don't we just warm up first ?
Warm up emotionally, all right ?

187
00:09:59,738 --> 00:10:01,873
<i>I have this kind of big secret
about Angela.</i>

188
00:10:01,932 --> 00:10:05,283
And I've been really nice to her
and I haven't told anyone, and...

189
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,547
what the hell ?!

190
00:10:07,735 --> 00:10:10,058
Here is a Kelly complaint.

191
00:10:10,104 --> 00:10:13,565
"Ryan never returns my calls."
Ah, join the club.

192
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:17,385
My voice mail's real spotty...
sometimes.

193
00:10:17,432 --> 00:10:19,403
I didn't file a complaint.
I was just talking.

194
00:10:19,473 --> 00:10:20,901
To your HR representative.

195
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:23,434
To my friend, I thought.
I want that withdrawn.

196
00:10:23,997 --> 00:10:27,164
Fine, I'll take your name off.
So no one will know.

197
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,186
Making progress.

198
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:32,544
- Dwight tried to kiss me.
- What ?

199
00:10:32,603 --> 00:10:35,673
And I didn't tell anyone 'cause I'm
not really sure how I feel about it.

200
00:10:35,732 --> 00:10:37,433
That is not true.
Redact it. Redact it!

201
00:10:37,456 --> 00:10:39,544
Well, I'm not actually making
a formal complaint.

202
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:41,456
I just really think
we should talk about it.

203
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:43,227
Okay, question.
When a name is withdrawn,

204
00:10:43,274 --> 00:10:46,473
does that also apply to the permanent
misbehavior file in New York ?

205
00:10:47,364 --> 00:10:48,382
Sure.

206
00:10:49,593 --> 00:10:50,927
Stanley.

207
00:10:52,411 --> 00:10:53,713
Thanks for ratting me out.

208
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,021
I didn't do it.

209
00:10:55,214 --> 00:10:56,352
I find that hard to believe

210
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,718
considering you have problems
with every single person

211
00:10:58,753 --> 00:11:00,852
in this entire office
except Bobblehead Joe.

212
00:11:02,506 --> 00:11:07,994
Someone complained that
the men's room is "whites only".

213
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:09,812
Stanley, you know that's not true.

214
00:11:09,906 --> 00:11:11,266
I didn't say that.

215
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:13,964
Then why is there a picture
of a white man on the door ?

216
00:11:18,414 --> 00:11:22,179
Okay, Phyllis. You complained
that Angela is giving you dirty looks.

217
00:11:22,285 --> 00:11:24,666
And you tried to get off
the party planning committee.

218
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:27,845
No, I never said any such thing.
Angela and I are close.

219
00:11:27,927 --> 00:11:32,065
And... also, Phyllis, Stanley says
that you cry too much,

220
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,227
and that bugs him.

221
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,904
Stanley and I are close too.

222
00:11:35,045 --> 00:11:37,238
- We sit close.
- O... kay.

223
00:11:40,138 --> 00:11:41,440
Just take it.

224
00:11:43,306 --> 00:11:45,053
I can't believe Angela.

225
00:11:45,276 --> 00:11:48,303
I went against my better judgment,
and I gave her a Save The Date.

226
00:11:48,396 --> 00:11:50,678
And now it turns out
she complained about me to Toby.

227
00:11:50,725 --> 00:11:52,133
Well, it was redacted.

228
00:11:53,353 --> 00:11:56,567
Look, if she wants an invite,
maybe she's just trying to be friends.

229
00:11:56,743 --> 00:11:58,315
Don't take her side.

230
00:12:00,837 --> 00:12:02,679
Well, what does Roy
think about everything ?

231
00:12:02,707 --> 00:12:05,327
I don't know. I try not to bother him
about this kind of stuff.

232
00:12:05,355 --> 00:12:07,533
You mean like your thoughts
and your feelings ?

233
00:12:09,374 --> 00:12:11,152
I know you keep
saying it's your space,

234
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,875
even though there's no assigned
parking, but I keep forgetting.

235
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,810
- Yes, that's the problem.
- I guess so.

236
00:12:17,317 --> 00:12:18,983
Okay, well, all settled then.

237
00:12:21,431 --> 00:12:22,815
I don't like you.

238
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:29,360
Okay, Ryan, you told Toby that
Creed has a distinct old man smell ?

239
00:12:31,832 --> 00:12:33,474
I know exactly
what he's talking about.

240
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,665
I sprout mung beans on a damp
paper towel in my desk drawer.

241
00:12:37,122 --> 00:12:39,773
Very nutritious.
But they smell like death.

242
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,165
All right, Kevin. You are accused of

243
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:44,781
making sexually suggestive
remarks to Angela

244
00:12:44,828 --> 00:12:46,986
that made her feel uncomfortable.

245
00:12:47,021 --> 00:12:48,335
Solution.

246
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:50,889
Angela, you are to make
sexually suggestive remarks

247
00:12:50,912 --> 00:12:52,824
to Kevin that will make him
uncomfortable.

248
00:12:52,848 --> 00:12:54,162
I accept your decision.

249
00:12:56,856 --> 00:12:57,865
You know what, Dwight ?

250
00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:00,035
Maybe we should get our photo I.D.
taken together.

251
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,373
That doesn't make any sense.

252
00:13:01,443 --> 00:13:02,768
Well, it saves time, you know.

253
00:13:02,827 --> 00:13:05,290
'Cause we could just meet
in the parking lot every morning.

254
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,980
Walk in together. Perfect.

255
00:13:07,042 --> 00:13:08,368
- Smile.
- No.

256
00:13:09,564 --> 00:13:10,972
I never smile if I can help it.

257
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:13,729
Showing one's teeth is a
submission signal in primates.

258
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,465
When someone smiles at me,

259
00:13:15,582 --> 00:13:18,292
all I see is a chimpanzee
begging for its life.

260
00:13:21,004 --> 00:13:22,494
This came out really well.

261
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:24,981
There you go.

262
00:13:29,611 --> 00:13:30,901
This is humongous.

263
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,496
am not a security threat.

264
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:36,649
And my middle name is Kurt. Not Fart.

265
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:38,138
What did I write ?

266
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:44,424
I have another complaint
for Jim's permanent file.

267
00:13:44,482 --> 00:13:46,406
Talk to Michael.
I gave him the box.

268
00:13:47,403 --> 00:13:48,623
What box ?

269
00:13:51,126 --> 00:13:54,132
- But I didn't report your snoring...
- Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays...

270
00:14:01,347 --> 00:14:03,869
Four years of malfeasance
unreported. This cannot stand.

271
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,623
- Okay. Calm down.
- No! You calm down.

272
00:14:05,647 --> 00:14:07,711
Whose side is Toby on ?
Whose side are you on ?!

273
00:14:07,734 --> 00:14:08,732
- Him or me ?
- Stop.

274
00:14:08,755 --> 00:14:10,913
Him or me ?
I cannot work with Jim anymore.

275
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:12,675
- Either he goes, or I go.
- Dwight...

276
00:14:12,722 --> 00:14:13,731
- You choose!
- Stop...

277
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,901
One of us is out of here
by the end of today.

278
00:14:22,718 --> 00:14:23,762
I am not bluffing!

279
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:26,050
Do the right thing here, Michael.

280
00:14:26,097 --> 00:14:28,419
Okay, I have served you
loyally for years.

281
00:14:28,783 --> 00:14:30,624
I deserve this, you know I do!

282
00:14:33,111 --> 00:14:35,469
You know your I.D. says
you're a security threat ?

283
00:14:36,431 --> 00:14:37,674
You have 'till 5:00.

284
00:14:42,261 --> 00:14:46,961
Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales
manager position open in Stamford.

285
00:14:48,064 --> 00:14:50,785
Want me to call Jan
and tell her you're interested ?

286
00:14:50,961 --> 00:14:54,457
I could put in a good word for you.
'Cause I'll still be working here.

287
00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:00,388
Transfer, transfer, everybody.
Transfer, transfer, transfer!

288
00:15:00,869 --> 00:15:03,754
You two, in the conference room,
with me.

289
00:15:04,317 --> 00:15:07,103
Nobody leaves until
we work this out.

290
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,719
Cage match.

291
00:15:09,883 --> 00:15:12,640
Cage matches ? Yeah, they work.
How could they not work ?

292
00:15:12,898 --> 00:15:15,772
If they didn't work, everybody
would still be in the cage.

293
00:15:16,171 --> 00:15:17,949
Okay, so, Dwight, in your own words.

294
00:15:18,008 --> 00:15:20,799
"Someone replaced all my pens
and pencils with crayons."

295
00:15:20,858 --> 00:15:22,665
"I suspect Jim Halpert."

296
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,827
"Everyone has called me
Dwayne all day."

297
00:15:25,863 --> 00:15:28,071
"I think Jim Halpert paid them to."

298
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:33,159
Yes, five bucks each.
And it was totally worth it.

299
00:15:33,476 --> 00:15:36,630
"This morning I found a bloody glove
in my desk drawer"

300
00:15:36,654 --> 00:15:40,079
"and Jim Halpert tried to convince me
I committed murder."

301
00:15:40,256 --> 00:15:42,332
"I think he may be the real murderer."

302
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,710
"Jim Halpert said there was
an abandoned infant"

303
00:15:44,757 --> 00:15:47,020
"in the woman's room.
When I went to save the child,"

304
00:15:47,044 --> 00:15:48,721
"I saw Meredith on the can."

305
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:50,786
Gaaad.

306
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:55,795
"This morning I knocked myself
in the head with the phone."

307
00:15:58,329 --> 00:15:59,537
That actually took a while.

308
00:15:59,573 --> 00:16:02,529
I had to put more an more
nickels into his handset,

309
00:16:02,939 --> 00:16:06,837
'till he got used to the weight,
and then I just...took 'em all out.

310
00:16:06,954 --> 00:16:10,567
"Everytime I typed my name
it said 'Diapers'."

311
00:16:12,855 --> 00:16:14,333
Just a simple macro.

312
00:16:15,334 --> 00:16:18,677
You know, these actually don't
sound that funny one after another.

313
00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:21,105
But he does deserve it, though.

314
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:22,360
"By the end of the day,"

315
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:24,706
"my desk  was about
two feet closer to the copier."

316
00:16:26,189 --> 00:16:29,427
Yeah, I just moved it an inch every
time he went to the bathroom.

317
00:16:30,964 --> 00:16:33,228
And that's how I spent
my entire day that day.

318
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,681
The Japanese have this thing
called shiatsu massage

319
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:04,059
where they dig into
your body very hard.

320
00:17:04,129 --> 00:17:07,473
And it is very painful.
And apparently, some people throw up.

321
00:17:08,376 --> 00:17:10,207
But the next day they feel great.

322
00:17:10,993 --> 00:17:13,374
I've never had one.
They sound awful.

323
00:17:20,337 --> 00:17:22,320
Maybe Stamford would be cool.

324
00:17:24,372 --> 00:17:26,155
It's a good market.

325
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,595
Higher volume.

326
00:17:32,234 --> 00:17:33,688
Maybe we should both go.

327
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:35,788
I have a girlfriend.

328
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,665
Sure you do, Dwight, sure.

329
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:41,473
Hey, there's like, 300 more of these.

330
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,975
Let's get to them later.

331
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,723
So you're gonna transfer Jim or not ?

332
00:17:44,793 --> 00:17:46,729
Maybe, I haven't decided yet.

333
00:17:47,561 --> 00:17:49,798
- Let's get to work.
- I want an answer by tomorrow.

334
00:17:51,534 --> 00:17:54,349
Actually, tomorrow's not good.
How about later in the week ?

335
00:17:55,722 --> 00:17:56,965
Fine.

336
00:17:57,129 --> 00:17:58,146
Good. Okay.

337
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,967
Wait. How about a group
picture while you're here ?

338
00:18:07,108 --> 00:18:09,235
I can't. I only get reimbursed
for the I.D. photos.

339
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,393
Well, that's, what,
a computer camera, right ?

340
00:18:12,085 --> 00:18:14,838
- You mean, digital ?
- Yeah, it'll take, like, two seconds.

341
00:18:15,745 --> 00:18:17,055
20 bucks.

342
00:18:18,088 --> 00:18:21,607
All right. Everybody, come on.
Group photo for the newsletter.

343
00:18:22,088 --> 00:18:23,718
You gotta be kidding.

344
00:18:23,859 --> 00:18:26,041
Come on, everybody.
Come on, let's go. Creed, Kevin,

345
00:18:26,369 --> 00:18:28,248
Oscar, andale, let's go.

346
00:18:29,057 --> 00:18:30,852
One, two, three, smile.

347
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,148
- Try to smile.
- We resolved a lot today, everybody.

348
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:35,251
Think happy thoughts.

349
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:38,168
Alright, I'm just gonna take it
on three whether you smile or not.

350
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,619
Good, let's check that out.

351
00:18:42,801 --> 00:18:44,866
All right. One more.
We'll take one more.

352
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:46,535
- That'll be another 20.
- What ?

353
00:18:47,133 --> 00:18:49,104
Angela, I want to talk to you
about something.

354
00:18:49,139 --> 00:18:50,248
- What ?
- No, Pam, don't.

355
00:18:50,952 --> 00:18:53,129
- It's about the Save The Date.
- Pam it wasn't her.

356
00:18:53,158 --> 00:18:54,190
What ?

357
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,083
I'm the one who complained
about you.

358
00:19:00,145 --> 00:19:01,623
<i>Alright, come on, one more time!</i>

359
00:19:01,658 --> 00:19:03,758
I didn't know that Toby
was gonna write it down.

360
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,931
I was just venting.
You know, it was one day.

361
00:19:07,004 --> 00:19:07,860
<i>That's terrible.</i>

362
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:10,415
And I took it right back.
It was like...

363
00:19:11,007 --> 00:19:13,634
<i>Let's pay Mr...</i>

364
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:14,807
Oh, dear.

365
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:16,191
<i>Price gouger.</i>

366
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:21,735
We can do this. Come on, everybody.

367
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,674
All right. Here we go.

368
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:31,166
<i>It was really hard getting
a good picture of 15 people.</i>

369
00:19:31,598 --> 00:19:32,982
<i>He would not give me a discount.</i>

370
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,654
<i>And eight tries added up.</i>

371
00:19:35,017 --> 00:19:37,657
One, two...

372
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,278
Didn't say three, did I ?

373
00:19:39,407 --> 00:19:41,894
<i>But I'm sort of an expert
at Photoshop.</i>

374
00:19:42,117 --> 00:19:43,829
<i>So it turned out fine in the end.</i>

375
00:19:44,263 --> 00:19:47,172
<i>When people work together
there is going to be conflict.</i>

376
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:49,753
<i>You can't outrun your problems.</i>

377
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:53,421
<i>Hey, Pam, it's Jim. I have
a doctor's appointment in the city.</i>

378
00:19:53,468 --> 00:19:55,673
<i>So I probably won't be in
'till the late afternoon.</i>

379
00:19:55,966 --> 00:19:57,902
<i>Just thought I'd let you know.
Okay, bye.</i>

380
00:19:58,934 --> 00:20:01,902
- Okay, Jan will see you now.
- Oh, thanks.

381
00:20:01,972 --> 00:20:07,192
<i>And that is why the idea of a cage
match is so universally appealing.</i>

382
00:20:07,614 --> 00:20:09,973
<i>But here's the thing
about cage matches.</i>

383
00:20:10,003 --> 00:20:13,405
<i>Sometimes you have to open the cage.</i>

384
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:18,414
<i>And that is something that
Toby will never understand.</i>


9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

1
00:00:02,205 --> 00:00:05,279
<i>Tonight, the Scranton Business Park
is having Casino Night.</i>

2
00:00:05,337 --> 00:00:08,809
<i>And we are converting our warehouse
into a full-blown gambling hall.</i>

3
00:00:09,232 --> 00:00:11,217
<i>And I know it's illegal in
Pennsylvania,</i>

4
00:00:11,414 --> 00:00:12,809
but, it's for charity.

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,950
And I consider myself
a great philanderer.

6
00:00:16,396 --> 00:00:18,683
It's just, nice to know
at the end of the day,

7
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:21,941
I can look in the mirror and say,
"Michael, because of you,"

8
00:00:22,093 --> 00:00:26,375
"some little kid in the Congo
has a bellyful of rice this evening."

9
00:00:27,042 --> 00:00:28,215
Just...

10
00:00:28,717 --> 00:00:30,335
makes you feel good.

11
00:00:39,529 --> 00:00:42,297
Excuse me. How long is the wait
for a table for two ?

12
00:00:43,353 --> 00:00:48,151
I would never, ever serve you.
Not in a million, billion years.

13
00:00:48,866 --> 00:00:49,881
It's a nice tux.

14
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,945
I know.  It belonged to
my grandfather.

15
00:00:52,743 --> 00:00:55,605
He was buried in it.
So... family heirloom.

16
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:02,557
So, what's the deal ? We've gotta pay
for our own drinks ? That's lame.

17
00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:05,091
Come on, it'll be fun.
And besides, I'm a roulette expert.

18
00:01:05,126 --> 00:01:09,701
Impossible. Roulette is not a game
of skill. It is a game of chance.

19
00:01:10,327 --> 00:01:12,966
- I can always kind of win at roulette.
- Oh, really ?

20
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:15,289
How would you do that ?

21
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,893
Mind control.

22
00:01:18,222 --> 00:01:19,617
You can't be serious.

23
00:01:21,757 --> 00:01:22,848
Are you serious ?

24
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,871
Ever since I as a little kid,
like eight or nine, I could...

25
00:01:27,376 --> 00:01:29,206
sort of control things with my mind.

26
00:01:29,581 --> 00:01:31,540
I don't believe you. Continue.

27
00:01:31,622 --> 00:01:34,570
It was just little things, you know.
Like I could make something shake.

28
00:01:34,617 --> 00:01:38,030
Or I could make a marble fall off the
counter. You know, just little things.

29
00:01:39,931 --> 00:01:42,148
That's ridiculous. You know what ?

30
00:01:43,558 --> 00:01:45,564
Why don't you move that coat rack ?

31
00:01:45,998 --> 00:01:49,259
Excuse me, everyone!
Attention in the office, please!

32
00:01:49,564 --> 00:01:52,285
Jim is about to prove
his telekinetic powers.

33
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:55,548
And he needs absolute silence.
Go ahead.

34
00:01:56,669 --> 00:01:58,252
Okay, I'll try.

35
00:02:26,107 --> 00:02:27,667
Oh, my God.

36
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,544
Episode 22 - Season 2
Casino night

00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:56,559

39
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:09,511
I try not to think of it
as lagging behind.

40
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,065
It's more of a David
and Goliath thing.

41
00:03:12,163 --> 00:03:13,570
<i>Well, the fact of the matter is,</i>

42
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:15,406
<i>that your branch
is currently number four</i>

43
00:03:15,447 --> 00:03:17,282
<i>of the five branches
that I oversee and...</i>

44
00:03:17,306 --> 00:03:19,969
- Top 80%.
- <i>Michael...</i>

45
00:03:21,024 --> 00:03:22,702
<i>You know that I'm very serious here.</i>

46
00:03:22,772 --> 00:03:26,185
Jan, listen. I promise
I will kick it up a notch.

47
00:03:26,948 --> 00:03:27,980
<i>What ?</i>

48
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:30,960
Emeril. Oh, actually,
while I have you...

49
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:33,790
Not that I have you
or have ever had you.

50
00:03:33,837 --> 00:03:35,737
But, we're having our
Casino Night tonight,

51
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:38,975
and I think everyone would love
to see their fearless leader here.

52
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:41,544
<i>I thought that you were
their fearless leader ?</i>

53
00:03:41,614 --> 00:03:46,398
I am, but your are the Eva Peron
to my Cesar Chavez.

54
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:51,255
- <i>I think you can handle it...</i>
- Oh, come on...

55
00:03:51,313 --> 00:03:53,495
- <i>probably, Michael. </i>
- Come on! It'd be fun.

56
00:03:53,738 --> 00:03:56,342
I can hear it in your voice.
You need a break.

57
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,720
<i>Goodbye, Michael.</i>

58
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,300
Jan and I understand each other.

59
00:04:02,757 --> 00:04:05,103
The romance thing is sort of
on hold for the time being.

60
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,212
But we've remained good friends.
Good friends with privileges.

61
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:10,652
Not now. Someday.

62
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,827
Okay, everybody. Tonight's event is
to benefit the Boy Scouts of America.

63
00:04:15,898 --> 00:04:19,370
- Again. We do that every year.
- Well, they need our money.

64
00:04:19,464 --> 00:04:21,376
They don't have cookies
like the Girl Scouts.

65
00:04:21,422 --> 00:04:24,269
It'd be nice to do something for
people who are actually suffering.

66
00:04:24,316 --> 00:04:26,508
Well, Oscar, if you don't like it,

67
00:04:26,627 --> 00:04:28,609
then you should concentrate
on winning.

68
00:04:29,184 --> 00:04:33,474
Because the person at the end of the
evening with the highest chip count

69
00:04:33,802 --> 00:04:37,861
will receive $500 to donate
to the charity of their choice.

70
00:04:38,072 --> 00:04:41,617
And, they will get a mini fridge
compliments of Vance Refrigeration.

71
00:04:42,004 --> 00:04:44,257
So, get your charities into Pam.

72
00:04:44,362 --> 00:04:46,966
I, for example, am playing
for Comic Relief.

73
00:04:47,072 --> 00:04:48,515
That doesn't exist anymore.

74
00:04:49,336 --> 00:04:52,260
Comedy's very much alive,
as are homeless people.

75
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,242
No, they stopped making that show.

76
00:04:55,052 --> 00:04:57,586
Well, then they need our money
more than ever.

77
00:04:57,644 --> 00:05:00,436
You have to pick an approved,
nonprofit organization.

78
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:02,845
There's a great soup kitchen
in downtown Scranton.

79
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:04,862
Delicious pea soup on Thursdays.

80
00:05:05,226 --> 00:05:06,962
I'll probably give the money to them.

81
00:05:07,114 --> 00:05:09,202
Something with animals.

82
00:05:10,047 --> 00:05:11,724
Or people.

83
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,269
Kobe Bryant has a foundation
and he is so hot.

84
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,202
And he gave his wife
the biggest diamond ring.

85
00:05:18,612 --> 00:05:20,442
I know he didn't do it.

86
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:23,709
Maybe he did it.

87
00:05:24,061 --> 00:05:26,865
We are giving money
that has been gambled.

88
00:05:27,405 --> 00:05:29,808
Why don't we just deal drugs
or prostitute ourselves

89
00:05:29,856 --> 00:05:31,780
and donate that money to charity ?

90
00:05:31,921 --> 00:05:33,965
Oh, and another fun thing.

91
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,266
We, at the end of the night,
are going to give the check

92
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,067
to an actual group of Boy Scouts.
Right, Toby ? We're gonna...

93
00:05:41,255 --> 00:05:43,914
Actually, I didn't think it was
appropriate to invite children

94
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:47,574
since it's, you know.
There's gambling and alcohol.

95
00:05:47,609 --> 00:05:51,457
And it's in our dangerous warehouse.
And it's a school night.

96
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:56,361
And, you know, Hooters is catering.
You know. Is that enough ?

97
00:05:57,077 --> 00:05:58,637
Should I keep going ?

98
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,419
Why are you the way that you are ?

99
00:06:03,595 --> 00:06:07,337
Honestly, every time I try to do
something fun or exciting,

100
00:06:07,724 --> 00:06:10,070
you make it not, that way.

101
00:06:11,677 --> 00:06:17,195
I hate, so much about the things
that you choose to be.

102
00:06:19,577 --> 00:06:25,069
Okay, you know what ? I will not
donate my winnings to Comic Relief.

103
00:06:25,104 --> 00:06:26,629
Since, apparently, it doesn't exist.

104
00:06:26,676 --> 00:06:30,078
I am going to donate to
Afghanistanis with AIDS.

105
00:06:30,183 --> 00:06:32,400
Who ? I think you mean
the Aid to Afghanistan.

106
00:06:32,846 --> 00:06:35,182
No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS.

107
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:37,610
- Afghani.
- What ?

108
00:06:37,728 --> 00:06:39,593
- Afghani.
- That's a dog.

109
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,033
- No, that's afghan.
- That's a shawl.

110
00:06:42,103 --> 00:06:44,414
- Wait, canine AIDS ?
- No, humans with AIDS.

111
00:06:44,484 --> 00:06:47,104
- Who has AIDS ?
- Guys, the Afghanistanannis.

112
00:06:47,162 --> 00:06:49,743
Okay, you know what ? No, no.

113
00:06:50,893 --> 00:06:54,165
AIDS is not funny.
Believe me, I have tried.

114
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,807
There are certain topics
that are off-limits to comedians.

115
00:06:57,936 --> 00:07:00,892
JFK. AIDS. The Holocaust.

116
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:04,176
The Lincoln assassination
just recently became funny.

117
00:07:04,493 --> 00:07:07,576
"I need to see this play like
I need a hole in the head."

118
00:07:09,265 --> 00:07:11,540
And I hope to someday
live in a world

119
00:07:11,588 --> 00:07:14,215
where a person could tell
a hilarious AIDS joke.

120
00:07:14,978 --> 00:07:16,503
It's one of my dreams.

121
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:19,555
- What are you doing ?
- Oh, nothing.

122
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:23,297
"Till Death Do Us Rock."

123
00:07:23,954 --> 00:07:25,221
They're wedding bands.

124
00:07:25,924 --> 00:07:27,409
Roy was supposed to pick the band,

125
00:07:27,445 --> 00:07:29,952
but he's concentrating more
on the bachelor party now.

126
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:31,915
Wait, wait, where are you going ?
I mean,

127
00:07:31,997 --> 00:07:34,929
even if you don't hire a band,
you still have to watch the bands.

128
00:07:35,797 --> 00:07:39,338
Pam, these are people who have
never given up on their dreams.

129
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:41,039
I have great respect for that.

130
00:07:41,931 --> 00:07:44,253
And yes, they're all
probably very bad.

131
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:47,057
And that'll make me feel better
about not having dreams.

132
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:50,605
- There's a KISS cover band in here.
- Let's do it.

133
00:07:52,059 --> 00:07:53,573
I'm pretty happy these days.

134
00:07:53,948 --> 00:07:57,479
I'm getting married soon, and I'm
getting along with everybody at work.

135
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:02,061
Why did I talk to Jan
about transferring ?

136
00:08:03,198 --> 00:08:04,641
<i>Well, you know...</i>

137
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,656
I have no future here.

138
00:08:11,213 --> 00:08:13,113
I have already put down the deposit.

139
00:08:13,196 --> 00:08:15,295
Do you understand how
a deposit works ?

140
00:08:15,342 --> 00:08:18,838
Mike, I am not having fire eaters
in a paper warehouse.

141
00:08:18,861 --> 00:08:21,157
It's Casino Night. Like Las Vegas.

142
00:08:21,204 --> 00:08:22,940
There are fire eaters
all over the place.

143
00:08:22,975 --> 00:08:25,450
- Except my warehouse.
- Well, actually, it's my warehouse.

144
00:08:25,475 --> 00:08:27,340
Actually, it's owned
by Beekman Properties

145
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:30,275
and Dunder Mifflin is four years
into a seven-year lease.

146
00:08:30,498 --> 00:08:32,328
Why are you here ?

147
00:08:32,468 --> 00:08:35,412
When Darryl was coming, you said
you wanted me here for protection.

148
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,090
I said, not that.

149
00:08:40,415 --> 00:08:43,711
We just have a lot of stuff down
there that could be stolen.

150
00:08:44,026 --> 00:08:45,856
- That's ironic.
- What ?

151
00:08:46,196 --> 00:08:48,073
That you are afraid.

152
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:50,701
Why ? 'Cause I'm from the hood ?

153
00:08:51,451 --> 00:08:53,113
Dinkin' flicka.

154
00:08:54,486 --> 00:08:55,788
Dinkin' flicka.

155
00:08:56,175 --> 00:09:01,477
I taught Mike some phrases to help
with his interracial conversations.

156
00:09:02,238 --> 00:09:06,989
You know, stuff like "fleece it out,"
"going mach five," "dinkin flicka."

157
00:09:08,408 --> 00:09:10,684
You know, things us Negroes say.

158
00:09:10,895 --> 00:09:12,361
Gimme some.

159
00:09:16,872 --> 00:09:19,934
Oh, yeah. I taught him
a handshake too.

160
00:09:42,634 --> 00:09:45,716
I don't know how you're gonna decide.
They are all extremely good.

161
00:09:45,774 --> 00:09:48,120
I think I should hire them all.
Do like Lollapalooza.

162
00:09:48,284 --> 00:09:49,997
Have three stages. Yeah.

163
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:52,754
Your mom would love that.
She would.

164
00:09:53,898 --> 00:09:55,657
Now this band is called
Scrantonicity.

165
00:09:56,068 --> 00:09:57,393
Let's take a look.

166
00:09:58,918 --> 00:10:01,992
- Nice.
- Oh, wait! That's Kevin.

167
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:03,728
- On the drums.
- What ?

168
00:10:03,775 --> 00:10:06,722
- On the drums! On the drums!
- Oh, my God! That's Kevin.

169
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:08,986
Great song, Kev.

170
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,408
Oh, my God.
He's the drummer and the singer.

171
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:16,464
We really don't do
a lot of weddings.

172
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:19,762
We actually don't play
in public very often.

173
00:10:20,267 --> 00:10:23,540
We're all really hoping that
Pam's wedding works out.

174
00:10:25,048 --> 00:10:27,089
This could be a turning point
for the band.

175
00:10:29,623 --> 00:10:32,567
- Oh my...
- You haven't seen that since 1983.

176
00:10:33,435 --> 00:10:35,359
That is amazing.

177
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,233
Okay, we have to sign him.
I'm gonna call the label...

178
00:10:38,268 --> 00:10:39,570
No, no, no! Come back.

179
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,893
You're gonna lose him
to another wedding. Kev!

180
00:10:42,022 --> 00:10:43,652
Jim is great.

181
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:46,878
Being with him just takes away
all the stress of planning my wedding.

182
00:10:50,247 --> 00:10:51,913
Michael, Carol Stills for you.

183
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,564
- Who ?
- <i>Carol Stills.</i>

184
00:10:54,986 --> 00:10:57,309
- Do I know a Carol Stills ?
- <i>Your realtor.</i>

185
00:10:57,461 --> 00:10:59,366
Oh, yeah. Put her through.

186
00:10:59,472 --> 00:11:03,308
Hey, Carol, how goes the real
estate biz ? Is it real good ?

187
00:11:04,211 --> 00:11:05,208
Still me.

188
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:08,422
Sometimes I don't put Michael through
until he's already said something.

189
00:11:08,786 --> 00:11:11,267
I look at it as a practice run
for him.

190
00:11:11,725 --> 00:11:13,930
He usually does better
on the second attempt.

191
00:11:14,294 --> 00:11:16,123
Carol, you're on with Michael.

192
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:18,634
- <i>Hello, Michael.</i>
- Hi, Carol. How you doing ?

193
00:11:18,857 --> 00:11:22,306
<i>I'm great, I just needed one last
signature for your mortgage insurance.</i>

194
00:11:22,388 --> 00:11:25,896
Oh, hey. No problemo.
Incidentally, I love the place.

195
00:11:26,001 --> 00:11:27,010
<i>Oh, great.</i>

196
00:11:27,045 --> 00:11:29,368
Great, had a little bit
of a weird smell. It's okay.

197
00:11:29,426 --> 00:11:30,811
At Christmas, the tree helped.

198
00:11:30,869 --> 00:11:34,576
<i>Oh, good. I'm glad.
Can I drop it over later ?</i>

199
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,910
Actually, I'm sort of hosting

200
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:40,371
this charity thing in our warehouse.
Casino night.

201
00:11:40,746 --> 00:11:42,729
- <i>Oh, great.</i>
- Yeah. It'll be good.

202
00:11:43,315 --> 00:11:45,638
You know what ?
Why don't you come by ?

203
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,198
Bring the papers. I'll sign 'em.

204
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:49,227
And then you can stay
and have a drink...

205
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,749
- <i>To the casino thing ?</i>
- Yeah, it'll be fun.

206
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,822
- What do you...
- <i>Um, what ?</i>

207
00:11:54,245 --> 00:11:56,016
Oh, I'm sorry. Can you hold on ?

208
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,338
<i>Michael. Jan's on line two.</i>

209
00:11:58,737 --> 00:12:00,004
Okay, put her through.

210
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:04,769
Jan Levinson, I presume ?

211
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,399
It's still me.

212
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,792
Jan, here's Michael.

213
00:12:09,344 --> 00:12:10,962
- <i>Michael ?</i>
- Hey, Jan. How you doing ?

214
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,589
<i>You know, I...</i>

215
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,038
<i>I thought about it,
and you are right.</i>

216
00:12:16,413 --> 00:12:18,548
- I am ?
- <i>I could use a little fun.</i>

217
00:12:18,607 --> 00:12:21,527
<i>So I am going to drive up
for your Casino Night.</i>

218
00:12:23,422 --> 00:12:25,955
<i>Incidentally, what is the charity ?</i>

219
00:12:26,061 --> 00:12:27,293
AIDS.

220
00:12:28,313 --> 00:12:31,246
<i>Okay then. I will...
I'll see you tonight.</i>

221
00:12:31,422 --> 00:12:33,204
Okay, sounds great.

222
00:12:33,532 --> 00:12:34,869
- <i>Bye-bye.</i>
- Bye.

223
00:12:36,641 --> 00:12:39,749
Hello, Carol ?
Sorry about that. I just...

224
00:12:39,784 --> 00:12:40,969
<i>No, problemo.</i>

225
00:12:41,808 --> 00:12:42,757
Right.

226
00:12:43,918 --> 00:12:45,561
- I...
- <i>To answer your question...</i>

227
00:12:47,191 --> 00:12:48,786
- What ?
- <i>I'd love to go.</i>

228
00:12:50,147 --> 00:12:52,540
<i>I have to get a sitter,
but that shouldn't be a problem.</i>

229
00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:53,613
Problem, good.

230
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,182
-<i>And I'll bring the papers too.</i>
- Good. All right.

231
00:12:57,553 --> 00:12:59,453
- Sounds great.
- <i>Well, I'll see you tonight.</i>

232
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,095
- Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

233
00:13:05,963 --> 00:13:07,734
Two queens on Casino Night.

234
00:13:08,951 --> 00:13:12,329
I am going to drop
a deuce on everybody.

235
00:13:21,074 --> 00:13:22,400
Oh, my God!

236
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,279
<i>That's great.</i>

237
00:13:28,101 --> 00:13:29,376
- Hey, Carol.
- Hi!

238
00:13:29,411 --> 00:13:30,971
- You look great.
- Thanks.

239
00:13:31,065 --> 00:13:33,294
Thank you for inviting me.
It looks so great in here.

240
00:13:33,341 --> 00:13:34,479
Well. Just...

241
00:13:38,113 --> 00:13:41,772
That's how we do it in the paper biz.
It's European.

242
00:13:41,995 --> 00:13:43,121
- Michael.
- And... yes ?

243
00:13:43,274 --> 00:13:44,435
Ah, Dwight!

244
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:52,268
Codename ReMax is here.
No sign of Lan Jevinson.

245
00:13:52,983 --> 00:13:55,282
I'm Michael's wingman.
I've got his back.

246
00:13:55,329 --> 00:13:58,937
Two dates.
He's got two dates tonight.

247
00:13:59,817 --> 00:14:01,847
My job is to keep Jan
away from Carol.

248
00:14:01,952 --> 00:14:04,146
And vice versa. Michael said,

249
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,547
"We must deceive them,
so as not to hurt them,"

250
00:14:08,087 --> 00:14:10,773
"and in that way, we honor them."

251
00:14:13,096 --> 00:14:16,708
Can I get you a drink ?
The food is from Hooters.

252
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:19,248
- A drink would be good.
- Okay.

253
00:14:22,978 --> 00:14:24,468
<i>Oh, I steal things all the time.</i>

254
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:25,922
It's just something I do.

255
00:14:26,345 --> 00:14:28,080
I stopped caring a long time ago.

256
00:14:28,315 --> 00:14:31,693
You should see how many supplies
I've taken from this place.

257
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:34,614
Honestly... I love stealing things.

258
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,629
<i>I'm going to get a drink.
Do you need anything ?</i>

259
00:14:37,664 --> 00:14:39,107
I'm fine. Thanks, sweetheart.

260
00:14:42,837 --> 00:14:45,335
Billy, your nurse is hot.

261
00:14:45,617 --> 00:14:46,931
That's my girlfriend.

262
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:49,971
Your nurse became
your girlfriend ? Sweet.

263
00:14:50,006 --> 00:14:52,047
She was never my nurse.
I met her at Chili's.

264
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,490
She was my waitress.

265
00:14:55,355 --> 00:14:56,645
Chili's is great.

266
00:15:03,123 --> 00:15:10,197
Willkommen. Bienvenue.
And welcome to Monte Carlo.

267
00:15:11,355 --> 00:15:12,786
Dwight!

268
00:15:13,349 --> 00:15:16,117
I am no longer your boss.

269
00:15:16,364 --> 00:15:18,698
Lady Fortune is your boss.

270
00:15:19,003 --> 00:15:21,768
- Will Lady Fortune give me a raise ?
-Shut it, shut it, shut it.

271
00:15:21,826 --> 00:15:24,079
Will Lady Fortune be your mistress ?

272
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:28,126
Only time will tell my friends.

273
00:15:28,477 --> 00:15:33,375
Leave all your preconceived
notions about casinos at the door.

274
00:15:33,527 --> 00:15:37,047
Old friends. New lovers.

275
00:15:37,387 --> 00:15:41,481
And the disabled. Welcome all!

276
00:15:42,252 --> 00:15:45,243
Great, okay. Shuffle up and deal.

277
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:48,487
Let's get it started.
Black-eyed crows.

278
00:15:49,191 --> 00:15:51,373
Okay, the game is no-limit
Texas Hold 'Em.

279
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:53,215
Good luck, everybody.

280
00:15:57,473 --> 00:15:59,719
That's at least four red chips
to you, sir.

281
00:16:04,742 --> 00:16:06,197
All in.

282
00:16:07,474 --> 00:16:09,034
<i>Bluffing is a key part of poker.</i>

283
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:11,919
Which is too bad because
I am not very good at bluffing.

284
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,262
Did you believe me ?

285
00:16:17,257 --> 00:16:18,265
I'll call.

286
00:16:19,624 --> 00:16:20,856
What are...

287
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:23,976
- That's insane.
- I have good cards.

288
00:16:24,786 --> 00:16:27,038
Well, Toby, I went all in
on the first hand.

289
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:29,607
So doesn't that tell you that
I might have good cards too ?

290
00:16:29,704 --> 00:16:31,886
So, don't be stupid.
Just take it back.

291
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:33,763
I'm sorry. He can't, sir.
He's gone all in.

292
00:16:33,822 --> 00:16:35,652
All right, whatever.
Flip 'em.

293
00:16:39,745 --> 00:16:42,877
You really scr...
you really screwed that up.

294
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:45,353
Way to go Toby.

295
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:48,567
I don't really play cards...
but I'm not gonna lie to you.

296
00:16:48,614 --> 00:16:51,100
It felt really good to take
money from Michael.

297
00:16:52,543 --> 00:16:54,351
Gonna chase that feeling.

298
00:16:55,254 --> 00:16:56,662
That's the normal question.

299
00:16:58,105 --> 00:16:59,641
I expect to do very well tonight.

300
00:17:00,298 --> 00:17:02,421
I have an acute ability
to read people.

301
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:05,791
Jim, for instance, has a huge tell.

302
00:17:05,956 --> 00:17:07,750
When he gets a good hand,
he coughs.

303
00:17:11,891 --> 00:17:13,299
I will raise.

304
00:17:19,763 --> 00:17:20,772
Thanks.

305
00:17:21,804 --> 00:17:24,971
It's the weirdest thing.
Every time I cough, he folds.

306
00:17:26,204 --> 00:17:29,289
- Wow, bad luck.
- Ah, yeah, whatever.

307
00:17:29,372 --> 00:17:31,553
Hey, you know what ?
If luck weren't involved,

308
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:34,322
I would always be winning.

309
00:17:34,943 --> 00:17:36,743
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

310
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:39,722
- Michael ?
- Jan.

311
00:17:39,887 --> 00:17:41,447
- Hi.
- Look, okay.

312
00:17:41,634 --> 00:17:43,370
I think we're all adults here.

313
00:17:43,722 --> 00:17:45,880
And it has always been
my understanding

314
00:17:45,928 --> 00:17:47,781
that we have an open relationship.

315
00:17:48,188 --> 00:17:50,405
What are... wait.
What are you talking about ?

316
00:17:50,922 --> 00:17:52,411
What does that mean ?

317
00:17:52,892 --> 00:17:56,400
After you said you weren't coming,
I invited Carol to come.

318
00:17:56,517 --> 00:17:58,985
And I don't think that
I did anything wrong.

319
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:02,058
No, no you didn't.

320
00:18:02,129 --> 00:18:04,674
- Hi, I'm Jan. I'm Michael's boss.
- Hi.

321
00:18:05,108 --> 00:18:08,087
- Does anyone want a drink ?
- No, I'm good.

322
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:20,144
- What ?
- Jan's here.

323
00:18:24,623 --> 00:18:26,262
- Give me the dice.
- Come on, Dwight.

324
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:28,011
- Let's go.
- It's on you, baby.

325
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,836
Good evening, Dwight.
What is this ?

326
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:33,124
Evening, Angela. This is craps.

327
00:18:33,183 --> 00:18:35,514
I need to roll an eight.
If I do, everyone wins.

328
00:18:35,889 --> 00:18:37,567
Then roll an eight.

329
00:18:38,036 --> 00:18:40,018
- Thank you Angela.
- Good luck, Dwight.

330
00:18:46,138 --> 00:18:47,369
<i>That's good stuff.</i>

331
00:18:48,202 --> 00:18:50,525
<i>Dwight, let's keep it going.
Let's keep it going.</i>

332
00:18:50,912 --> 00:18:53,090
- <i>Let it ride. Let it all ride.</i>
- Gimme the dice.

333
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:04,313
- Yeah, right.
- "Yeah, right," what ?

334
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,803
What was this ?

335
00:19:07,633 --> 00:19:09,392
- I have good cards.
- Really ?

336
00:19:09,932 --> 00:19:11,914
And I'm going to take you all in.

337
00:19:14,874 --> 00:19:16,587
I think you're bluffing.

338
00:19:27,244 --> 00:19:29,050
Yeah, I think she's full of it.

339
00:19:30,818 --> 00:19:33,692
Sorry. Straight.

340
00:19:35,569 --> 00:19:36,672
Three nines.

341
00:19:37,563 --> 00:19:39,850
Jim Halpert, ladies and gentlemen.

342
00:19:39,902 --> 00:19:42,049
Thank you very much. It was fun.

343
00:19:44,043 --> 00:19:45,721
Cosmopolitan, please.

344
00:19:46,612 --> 00:19:48,266
Can I get a red wine ?

345
00:19:50,511 --> 00:19:52,247
So two hours. That's a long drive.

346
00:19:52,939 --> 00:19:56,810
Well, it's part of the job. You know,
keep an eye on things. So...

347
00:19:58,265 --> 00:19:59,449
why not ?

348
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,320
So, how long have you
and Michael been, um...

349
00:20:09,727 --> 00:20:13,657
Well, actually, I guess this would be
our first date, I guess.

350
00:20:15,342 --> 00:20:17,266
Casino night in the warehouse.

351
00:20:17,395 --> 00:20:18,603
Good sport.

352
00:20:18,897 --> 00:20:20,234
Well, I'm having a nice time.

353
00:20:20,328 --> 00:20:22,993
Oh, me too. Me too.

354
00:20:30,864 --> 00:20:34,077
One beer, and one 7 and 7
with eight maraschino cherries,

355
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,260
sugar on the rim,
blended if you can.

356
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,201
So, that's still going on ?
You and Kelly ?

357
00:20:43,287 --> 00:20:44,765
- <i>All right!</i>
- Point is four!

358
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,149
Shooter roll a four.

359
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:50,771
- Come on shooter! Come on shooter!
- Blow! Blow for luck.

360
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:55,590
Also you. Not playing favorites.

361
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,361
All right, here we go.

362
00:20:59,238 --> 00:21:02,183
- Five.
- So close, so close.

363
00:21:02,241 --> 00:21:03,574
Come on.

364
00:21:03,622 --> 00:21:05,272
So, where are you staying, Radisson ?

365
00:21:05,471 --> 00:21:06,726
- What ?
- Super 8 ?

366
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:07,806
- No, I...
- Motel 6 ?

367
00:21:07,841 --> 00:21:09,764
- Best Western ?
- I..., I didn't, I don't...

368
00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:12,616
Holiday Inn ?
The Hyatt in Wilkes-Barre ?

369
00:21:12,827 --> 00:21:15,068
- Are you staying with Michael ?
- All right!

370
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,494
I won the 2002, $2,500...

371
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,015
No-Limit Deuce
to Seven Draw Tournament

372
00:21:25,087 --> 00:21:27,151
at the World Series
of Poker in Vegas.

373
00:21:27,796 --> 00:21:31,468
So, yeah. I'm pretty good at poker.

374
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:36,251
All in.

375
00:21:36,286 --> 00:21:37,612
Okay, let's do it.

376
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,726
Good luck, honey.

377
00:21:38,796 --> 00:21:41,612
Oh, thank you Bobby, but it doesn't
matter. It's just fun to play.

378
00:21:42,446 --> 00:21:44,992
- Three queens.
- Nice. Very nice.

379
00:21:45,355 --> 00:21:46,962
- I have an Ace.
- No, that's a flush.

380
00:21:46,998 --> 00:21:48,264
Oh man!

381
00:21:48,311 --> 00:21:50,610
- I have a flush!
- Yes!

382
00:21:50,657 --> 00:21:53,027
Look, I won.
Look, I have all the clovers.

383
00:21:53,191 --> 00:21:54,730
You want to play again ?

384
00:21:54,824 --> 00:21:55,939
I suck.

385
00:21:58,496 --> 00:21:59,938
She took you down, huh ?

386
00:22:00,525 --> 00:22:02,578
I do not want to talk about it.

387
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:05,461
Hey, I saw your tape.

388
00:22:05,753 --> 00:22:08,768
Your band, Scrantonicity.
You guys rock.

389
00:22:09,882 --> 00:22:11,911
Yeah, you guys want
to play our wedding ?

390
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,110
Awesome. Did Pam say it was okay ?

391
00:22:17,107 --> 00:22:18,948
Whatever.
I'm in charge of the music.

392
00:22:19,241 --> 00:22:21,752
Dude, you will not be sorry.

393
00:22:22,585 --> 00:22:25,115
Sweet. All right.

394
00:22:34,997 --> 00:22:36,017
Smoke ?

395
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:37,613
No, thanks.

396
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:40,979
You, having fun ?

397
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:43,783
Fabulous time.

398
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,522
I drove two and a half hours
to get here.

399
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:54,073
- Yeah, we all really...
- Left work early, drove down here.

400
00:22:54,343 --> 00:22:57,203
And I am completely underdressed.

401
00:22:57,895 --> 00:22:59,842
I think you look great.

402
00:23:01,543 --> 00:23:03,877
Why did I hook up with Michael ?

403
00:23:06,835 --> 00:23:08,266
Yeah, why did you ?

404
00:23:09,216 --> 00:23:12,113
It was very late, Jim. Very...

405
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:15,081
very late and...

406
00:23:15,245 --> 00:23:17,905
Have you given any more
thought to the transfer ?

407
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:20,944
- Oh, yeah.
- Good.

408
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:25,295
Have you told anyone ?

409
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,004
- No.
- Well, you should.

410
00:23:37,628 --> 00:23:40,138
Excuse me. Big moment.

411
00:23:40,162 --> 00:23:43,904
The, evening's chip leader

of this beautiful mini refrigerator

413
00:23:49,883 --> 00:23:51,912
Creed Bratton, Dunder-Mifflin.

414
00:23:57,214 --> 00:23:58,939
Thanks, I never owned a refrigerator.

415
00:24:04,879 --> 00:24:06,709
Sorry babe, I am just beat.

416
00:24:07,002 --> 00:24:08,856
It's okay. I'll see you at home.

417
00:24:08,973 --> 00:24:11,580
Okay. Hey, don't try to lose
too much money, all right ?

418
00:24:11,674 --> 00:24:14,466
- Okay.
- In case you still want a honeymoon.

419
00:24:15,944 --> 00:24:18,395
Hey, Halpert!
Keep an eye on her, all right ?

420
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,178
Okay, will do.

421
00:24:20,949 --> 00:24:22,157
- Bye.
- See you.

422
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:26,005
- Hey.
- Hey, how's it going ?

423
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:29,195
Good. Especially after I took
all your money in poker.

424
00:24:34,287 --> 00:24:35,847
Can I talk to you about something ?

425
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,982
About when you wanna give me
more of your money ?

426
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,138
Did you wanna do that now ?
We can go inside.

427
00:24:40,407 --> 00:24:42,460
I'm feeling kinda good tonight.

428
00:24:42,601 --> 00:24:43,973
I was just, um...

429
00:24:47,868 --> 00:24:49,837
I'm in love with you.

430
00:24:49,966 --> 00:24:51,004
What ?

431
00:24:53,004 --> 00:24:57,098
I'm really sorry if that's weird
for you to hear. But you needed to...

432
00:24:57,297 --> 00:24:59,068
hear it.

433
00:25:00,782 --> 00:25:03,574
Probably not good timing.
I know that, I just...

434
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,369
What are you doing ?

435
00:25:08,712 --> 00:25:10,460
What do you expect me
to say to that ?

436
00:25:12,817 --> 00:25:14,917
I just needed you to know.

437
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,175
Once.

438
00:25:19,199 --> 00:25:22,899
Well, I... I...

439
00:25:26,986 --> 00:25:28,288
I can't ?

440
00:25:31,456 --> 00:25:34,615
- You have no idea...
- Don't do that.

441
00:25:34,943 --> 00:25:37,688
- what your friendship means to me.
- Come on.

442
00:25:37,923 --> 00:25:41,219
I don't wanna do that.
I wanna be more than that.

443
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:43,952
I can't.

444
00:25:47,201 --> 00:25:51,870
I'm really sorry
if you misinterpreted things.

445
00:25:55,188 --> 00:25:56,689
It's probably my fault.

446
00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:00,431
Not your fault.

447
00:26:01,381 --> 00:26:04,513
I'm sorry if I misinterpreted
that... our friendship.

448
00:26:14,969 --> 00:26:16,402
- I'm leaving.
- Hey! Okay.

449
00:26:16,437 --> 00:26:18,971
So, I just wanted to congratulate
you on a fantastic evening.

450
00:26:19,018 --> 00:26:20,613
- Did the company proud.
- Thank you.

451
00:26:20,648 --> 00:26:23,006
And thanks for inviting me.
You were right, I needed it.

452
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,684
- So thanks.
- Okay. Thanks for coming.

453
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,548
Nice to meet you.
And you guys have a,

454
00:26:26,595 --> 00:26:29,164
- have a good time together.
- Okay, talk to you Monday.

455
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:30,501
- Buh-bye.
- Goodnight.

456
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:34,985
- She's a good boss.
- She seems really nice.

457
00:26:35,044 --> 00:26:36,463
Oh, she's great.

458
00:26:36,651 --> 00:26:40,909
Love triangle drama.
All worked out in the end though.

459
00:26:40,979 --> 00:26:42,692
The hero got the girl.

460
00:26:42,997 --> 00:26:44,369
Who saw that coming ?

461
00:26:44,451 --> 00:26:46,973
I did. And Jan is really
happy for me.

462
00:26:47,407 --> 00:26:50,668
So actually the hero got two girls.
He got the girl that he works with,

463
00:26:50,821 --> 00:26:53,589
and he got the girl
that he buys real estate from.

464
00:26:55,396 --> 00:26:59,525
So, I've got my New York girl
and my local flavor.

465
00:27:00,592 --> 00:27:02,504
Life is good.

466
00:27:04,393 --> 00:27:06,566
About ten minutes ago.

467
00:27:07,704 --> 00:27:09,546
No, I didn't know what to say.

468
00:27:10,871 --> 00:27:12,760
Yes, I know.

469
00:27:14,871 --> 00:27:17,307
I don't know, Mom.
He's my best friend.

470
00:27:19,923 --> 00:27:21,835
Yeah, he's great.

471
00:27:24,263 --> 00:27:26,433
Yeah, I think I am.

472
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,573
I have to go. I will.

473
00:27:32,553 --> 00:27:33,902
Listen, Jim...

2x01 : The Dundies
by Belkiss, Occeanne et Unfold
http://pmag.f2o.org/theofficeus/
2
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:37,422
Tonight is the Dundies, the annual employee
world's night here at Dunder Mifflin

3
00:00:37,445 --> 00:00:42,880
and this is everybody's favorite day,
everybody looks forward to it.

4
00:00:42,977 --> 00:00:47,893
Because, you know a lot of the people
here don't get trophies very often

5
00:00:47,944 --> 00:00:51,624
like Meredith or Kevin. I mean, who's gonna
give Kevin an award ? Dunkin Donuts ?

6
00:00:51,675 --> 00:00:54,453
Plus, bonus, it's really really funny.

7
00:00:54,605 --> 00:00:58,070
So I..., you know an employee will go
home, and he'll tell his neighbor :

8
00:00:58,077 --> 00:01:00,644
"Hey, did you get an award ?"
And the neighbor will say :

9
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:04,413
"No man, I mean I slave all day,
nobody notices me."

10
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:09,640
Next thing you know, employee smells something
terrible coming from the neighbor’s house :

11
00:01:09,673 --> 00:01:13,786
Neighbor’s hanged himself,
due to lack of recognition.

12
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:19,190
So you're ready for the Dundies ?

13
00:01:19,276 --> 00:01:20,756
You know what they say about a car wreck
where it's so awful you can't look away ?

14
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:27,912
The Dundies are like a car wreck that
you want you have to stare at it,

15
00:01:27,928 --> 00:01:30,373
because your boss is making you.

16
00:01:32,146 --> 00:01:35,543
It's fat Halpert

17
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:41,982
- What ?
- Fat Halpert, Jim Halpert.

18
00:01:43,198 --> 00:01:46,710
So why don't I take you on a
tour of past Dundee winners ?

19
00:01:46,905 --> 00:01:52,221
We got fat Jim Halpert here, Jim why don't
you show off your Dundies to the camera ?

20
00:01:52,276 --> 00:01:56,302
Oh I can't, because I keep them hidden,
I don't wanna look at them and get cocky.

21
00:01:56,305 --> 00:02:01,002
- Oh, that's a good idea.
- And mine are at home,
in a display case about my bed.

22
00:02:01,076 --> 00:02:03,601
TMI, TMI my friend.

23
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:06,022
TMI ? Too Much Information.

24
00:02:07,207 --> 00:02:10,923
It's just easier to say TMI. I used to
say "Don't Go There" but that's lame.

25
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:15,893
And here we have Stanley the manly, now
Stanley is a Dundee Allstar, aren’t you
Stan ?

26
00:02:15,915 --> 00:02:18,432
Why don't you show them some of your bling ?

27
00:02:18,525 --> 00:02:20,731
I don't know where they are,
I think I threw them out.

28
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:24,983
- Oh, no you didn't.
- I think I did.

29
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:26,990
Why did...?

30
00:02:26,998 --> 00:02:29,862
Say, we gotta order some
more appetizers this time.

31
00:02:29,996 --> 00:02:32,763
- We ran out last year, remember ?
- Yes we should, you know what ?

32
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:35,543
I wanted one of those skillets of cheese,

33
00:02:35,608 --> 00:02:41,262
but when I got on stage,
someone had eaten all of them.

34
00:02:41,655 --> 00:02:45,853
<i>To Oscar Martinez,
It's the "Show Me The Money" award !</i>

35
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:50,041
Michael has tapped every Dundies Awards,

36
00:02:50,206 --> 00:02:55,192
and now he's making me look through
hours of footage to find highlights.

37
00:02:55,215 --> 00:02:57,961
<i>That's the type of song
we're gonna play to the ladies,
Hit it Dwight !</i>

38
00:03:00,528 --> 00:03:07,440
<i>A little bit of Pam, all night long.
A little bit of Angela, on the sing.</i>

39
00:03:07,495 --> 00:03:09,200
<i>A little bit of...</i>

40
00:03:09,236 --> 00:03:13,793
This is the part where Kevin stands in front
of the camcorder all night. It's great.

41
00:03:21,005 --> 00:03:23,350
- It was you.
- It wasn't lme, I swear.

42
00:03:24,857 --> 00:03:26,603
So what's the joke ?
You're not perfect either !

43
00:03:26,775 --> 00:03:30,032
- We're not laughing at you Dwight !
- So who are you laughing at ?

44
00:03:30,205 --> 00:03:34,260
- Just something somebody wrote.
- Who ? Dave Barry ?

45
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:38,170
No, no. That was just something that
was written on the ladies room wall.

46
00:03:38,306 --> 00:03:39,653
What is it ? Who wrote it ?

47
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:43,962
- It's kind of private,
- It's about Michael !

48
00:03:44,145 --> 00:03:47,572
That is defacement of company
property, so you'd better tell me.

49
00:03:47,746 --> 00:03:50,462
Kelly, if you tell me, 
you'll be punished less.

50
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:53,641
- Ok, now I'm laughing at you !

51
00:03:55,355 --> 00:03:59,413
Will her highness Jan Levinson Gould be

52
00:03:59,477 --> 00:04:04,113
descending from her corporate throne
this evening to visit us lowly serfs here,

53
00:04:04,147 --> 00:04:05,572
Dunder Mifflin Scranton ?

54
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:09,033
<i>- It's a two and a half hour drive
from New York Michael.</i>

55
00:04:09,068 --> 00:04:12,920
- Well, you could take the bus, you could
work on the way here, sleep on the way home.

56
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:13,891
<i>- No.</i>

57
00:04:13,948 --> 00:04:16,761
Come on Jan this is important, I mean,

58
00:04:16,785 --> 00:04:21,321
this is validation to my employees here
that you and corporate approved of this.

59
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,570
<i>We don't approve of this Michael.</i>

60
00:04:24,575 --> 00:04:27,852
<i>You only have the budget for
one office party a year so,</i>

61
00:04:28,008 --> 00:04:29,963
<i>we're not paying for this.</i>

62
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:37,231
<i>- Are you here ?</i>
- Yeah, I'm here, I just wanted to

63
00:04:37,398 --> 00:04:39,981
talk to you for a second about that.

64
00:04:40,218 --> 00:04:46,662
What..., what is..., I mean, come on Jan !
You're dropping a A-bomb on me here !

65
00:04:46,757 --> 00:04:51,911
<i>- Really ? I'm dropping an atomic bomb on you.</i>
- Well, yeah, what is... no you can't !

66
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:53,500
<i>- You allready had a party
on May 5th for no reasons ?</i>

67
00:04:53,505 --> 00:04:57,181
No reasons ? It was the 05-05-05 party !

68
00:04:57,188 --> 00:05:00,130
<i>- And you also had a...</i>
- It happens once every billion years !

69
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:03,682
<i>- And the tsunami relief fund raiser
with somehow lost a lot of money</i>

70
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:09,523
Ok, no that was a fun raiser, I think I made
that very clear on the flyers. Fun, F-U-N.

71
00:05:09,558 --> 00:05:11,890
<i>... don't have a tsunami Fun raiser, Michael.
- Well...</i>

72
00:05:11,956 --> 00:05:15,650
I think a lot of people were
very affected by the footage.

73
00:05:15,675 --> 00:05:22,460
It's a little character I like to do.
It is loosely based on Karnack,

74
00:05:22,576 --> 00:05:25,842
one  of Carson's classic characters.

75
00:05:26,178 --> 00:05:33,362
We got... the PLO, the IRA and the
hot-dogs stand behind the warehouse.

76
00:05:38,495 --> 00:05:43,793
Name 3 businesses that have better
healthcare plans than Dunder Mifflin.

77
00:05:45,566 --> 00:05:49,740
Here's the problem : There is
no open bar because of Jan,

78
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:55,800
and it's the reason why comedy
clubs have a 2-drink minimum.

79
00:05:56,775 --> 00:06:02,751
We'll be fine. I just wish
people gonna be drunk.

80
00:06:14,447 --> 00:06:17,660
- Dwight get out of here what are
you doing into ladies room...?
- No no no, it's not what you're...

81
00:06:17,695 --> 00:06:20,060
- Why were you in there ?
- You are a pervert !
- What were you doing in there ?

82
00:06:20,076 --> 00:06:20,993
- You are a pervert !
- I am not !

83
00:06:21,126 --> 00:06:29,210
<i>The Dundee award, for longest engagement,
goes to Pam Beesly, Pam everybody !</i>

84
00:06:30,926 --> 00:06:34,090
<i>When will that girl gonna be
married ? That’s what I have to say</i>

85
00:06:34,108 --> 00:06:35,330
<i>- Oh Roy's accepting ?
- Yes.</i>

86
00:06:35,358 --> 00:06:38,433
<i>Thank you, you have any words you'd
like to say, at Pam's behalf ?</i>

87
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:43,711
<i>- We'll see you next year !
- Yeah ! Oh nuts ! Oh gosh !</i>

88
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,863
- I'm not changing that, that's the best one.
- No it's clear it is, you're right.

89
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:53,323
I just think, world's on disengagement,
we're all expecting it you know ?

90
00:06:53,448 --> 00:06:58,712
That's why it's funny, every year that Roy
and Pam don't get married it gets funnier !

91
00:06:58,867 --> 00:07:02,922
Well I think if you use the same jokes
it just comes across as lazy.

92
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,003
- Ow, lazy !

93
00:07:07,578 --> 00:07:11,151
Excuse me, everyone, can I
have your attention please ?

94
00:07:12,157 --> 00:07:15,171
I just wanted to say that the
women in this office are terrible.

95
00:07:15,238 --> 00:07:19,710
Especially the ones who wrote that stuff
about Michael on the bathroom wall.

96
00:07:19,765 --> 00:07:24,430
Having a bathroom is a privilege,
it is called a ladies-room for a reason,

97
00:07:24,467 --> 00:07:30,170
and if you cannot behave like ladies, well
then you are not going to have a bathroom.

98
00:07:30,557 --> 00:07:34,643
- You're taking away our bathroom ?
- We are going to have 2 men rooms.

99
00:07:34,698 --> 00:07:39,660
- But where would we go ?
- Be prepared to hold it folks, from 9 AM...

100
00:07:40,175 --> 00:07:40,791
- Michael ?
- Yes ?

101
00:07:40,805 --> 00:07:43,113
Dwight is banning us from our bathroom.

102
00:07:43,116 --> 00:07:46,470
- Ok, well that's ridiculous, just don't...
I don't have time for this right now.

103
00:07:46,476 --> 00:07:52,031
- There needs to be repercussions
to people's behavior...
- Don't don't talk don't touch stop it oddment !

104
00:07:52,277 --> 00:07:56,593
- Ok, look I know there have been a lot of rumors
flying around about the Dundies this year,

105
00:07:56,607 --> 00:08:02,763
how there is no money, and how there is
no food, and how the jokes are really bad.

106
00:08:02,895 --> 00:08:05,612
But what the hell everybody ?

107
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:12,673
I mean, god the Dundies are about
the best, in every one of us.

108
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,001
Can't you see that ? I mean...

109
00:08:16,345 --> 00:08:21,970
ok, we can do better, so,
tonight, for the first time,

110
00:08:22,047 --> 00:08:28,272
We  are inviting all of your friends and
family to attend the awards with us.

111
00:08:28,286 --> 00:08:30,350
- Yes !
- Yeah, not bad right ?

112
00:08:30,365 --> 00:08:32,543
So let's make this best Dundies ever !

113
00:08:34,337 --> 00:08:35,552
Best Dundies ever !

114
00:08:43,927 --> 00:08:48,410
Welcome to eighth annual Dundies awards !
Before we get started, a few announcements :

115
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,783
Keep your acceptance speeches shorts,

116
00:08:50,805 --> 00:08:55,320
I have wrap it up music and I'm
not afraid to use it, Devin.

117
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:09,171
<i>The Dundies, how can I explain it ?
A word to auto mated,</i>

118
00:09:09,236 --> 00:09:11,960
<i>You've all made it
You had a was, you work so hard</i>

119
00:09:11,987 --> 00:09:13,800
<i>You fell a no, no
This isn't just a name</i>

120
00:09:13,815 --> 00:09:15,610
<i> And now the N-O
And he's been says Hello</i>

121
00:09:15,865 --> 00:09:18,053
<i>Cut, come on !</i>

122
00:09:18,228 --> 00:09:22,841
The Dundies are kind of like a kid's
birthday party, and you go,

123
00:09:23,075 --> 00:09:28,173
and there's really nothing for you to do there,
but the kid's having a really good time, so,

124
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:31,853
you're kind of there.
That's kind of what it's like.

125
00:09:32,098 --> 00:09:35,610
<i>... Dundee, you wanted that Dundee...</i>

126
00:09:36,848 --> 00:09:41,642
- The waitress tripped on the cord. 
- All right, joke'o'landed, so we are here,

127
00:09:41,685 --> 00:09:46,561
Thank you all for coming,
to the 2005 Dundee Awards,

128
00:09:46,805 --> 00:09:51,503
I am your host, Michael Scott,
and I just want to tell you

129
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:58,022
please, please, do not drink and drive, because
you may hit a bump, and spill the drink.

130
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,973
All the flotties on the group tab.

131
00:10:01,046 --> 00:10:05,500
No, actually this year no group tab
we're gonna be doing separate checks !

132
00:10:08,385 --> 00:10:14,140
- You said we could bring our families.
- I did, and why didn't you Stanley ?

133
00:10:14,306 --> 00:10:19,002
- I did, my wife's name is Terry.
- Well, I'm looking forward to meeting Terry.

134
00:10:19,055 --> 00:10:22,351
It's this person whose hand
I'm holding Michael.

135
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:26,430
<i>Oh yeah !
- Shut it !</i>

136
00:10:26,496 --> 00:10:31,842
Good,  speaking of relationships,
of all way shapes and forms,

137
00:10:32,486 --> 00:10:37,781
I was out on a very very hot date
last night with a girl from HR Dwight.

138
00:10:37,865 --> 00:10:43,542
- Really ? We don't have any girls from HR.
- Know that, for the sake of the story.

139
00:10:43,707 --> 00:10:48,170
And things were getting hot and heavy,
and I was about to take her bra off,

140
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:45,823
<i>Yeah ! </i>

141
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:51,313
When she had me fill out
six hours worth of paper work.

142
00:10:48,255 --> 00:10:48,921
<i>Yeah ! </i>

143
00:10:51,387 --> 00:10:55,670
- Like an AIDS test ?
- No... god.

144
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:01,496
- All right. So let's get this party started !
- Hey let's go to Poor Richard's.

145
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:07,680
- Yeah, let's get out of here.
- Guys, where are you going ?

146
00:11:07,776 --> 00:11:11,786
- Just... Pam shows is getting started.
- Sorry.

147
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:19,310
- You're staying ?
- Yeah. I have to eat somewhere.

148
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:30,123
- The Busiest Beaver award goes to Phyllis Lapin !
Way to go Phyllis ! Nice work ! Per usual !

149
00:11:30,195 --> 00:11:35,132
- This says bushiest beaver.
- What ? I told them busiest... idiots !

150
00:11:35,147 --> 00:11:37,860
- It's fine,
- Well we can fix it, we'll fix it up !

151
00:11:37,936 --> 00:11:39,021
You don't have to display that.

152
00:11:39,056 --> 00:11:41,830
- Because that's what happen every time !
- He's a jackass, every year !

153
00:11:41,877 --> 00:11:45,141
- Come on, we're going to Poor Richard's.
- No, I don't want go I don't want to !

154
00:11:45,315 --> 00:11:45,663
Pam !

155
00:11:45,665 --> 00:11:47,953
If you would have asked me
that then you would know !

156
00:11:48,618 --> 00:11:50,532
Herro everybodeeee.

157
00:11:52,036 --> 00:11:55,463
Hey ! How are you ? I thought you'd left.

158
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:59,421
No, I decided to stay. I'll just
get a ride home from Angela.

159
00:12:01,317 --> 00:12:03,690
<i>Jan Levinson Gould !</i>

160
00:12:03,726 --> 00:12:05,932
- Good I'm just in time for Ping !
- Yeah

161
00:12:10,487 --> 00:12:12,171
You know what I'm talking about !

162
00:12:12,217 --> 00:12:13,263
Can I get a drink ?

163
00:12:17,985 --> 00:12:23,062
This next award goes to somebody
who really lights up the office.

164
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:28,620
Somebody who I think a lot of
us cannot keep from checking out.

165
00:12:28,758 --> 00:12:32,920
The hottest, in the office award goes to...

166
00:12:33,428 --> 00:12:35,952
Ryan the temp !

167
00:12:42,885 --> 00:12:43,971
Here you go !

168
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:56,272
What am I going to do with the award ?

169
00:12:57,956 --> 00:13:01,583
Nothing, I don't know what I'm gonna do.

170
00:13:02,207 --> 00:13:05,031
That's the least of my concerns right now.

171
00:13:05,257 --> 00:13:10,122
And the Tight Ass award goes to Angela,

172
00:13:10,216 --> 00:13:16,473
not only because she is everybody's favorite
stickler, but because she has a great caboose !

173
00:13:18,127 --> 00:13:22,013
- So come on down !
- No.

174
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:31,160
I think those might be empty.

175
00:13:31,326 --> 00:13:34,773
No, no ‘cause the ice melts,
and then it's like second drink !

176
00:13:35,976 --> 00:13:37,340
Second drink ?

177
00:13:38,466 --> 00:13:43,003
The spicy curry award goes to our
very own Kelly Kapoor !

178
00:13:43,605 --> 00:13:44,700
Get on up here !

179
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,750
There you go !

180
00:13:47,365 --> 00:13:49,331
- Spicy curry, what's that mean ?

181
00:13:49,407 --> 00:13:51,401
- Not everything means something,
this is a joke.

182
00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:54,321
- Yeah, but why did you give it to me ?
- I don't know, I'd just...

183
00:13:54,386 --> 00:13:57,443
- This is a bowler !
- I know ! They didn't have
any businessmen so...

184
00:13:57,576 --> 00:13:59,861
- Yeah but everyone else...
- Just sit down Kelly.

185
00:14:04,035 --> 00:14:05,550
It's so freakin' hot in there.

186
00:14:05,656 --> 00:14:09,103
ow I know what Bob Hope was going
through when he performed in Saudi Arabia

187
00:14:09,775 --> 00:14:12,563
I got Dwight, sucking the
funny out of room, but,

188
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:16,541
you know, you do what you can do...
here we go, he's early with the cue !

189
00:14:16,887 --> 00:14:17,991
Got to go !

190
00:14:18,406 --> 00:14:19,202
("Tiny Dancer" - Elton John)

191
00:14:19,206 --> 00:14:22,000
"You have won a tiny Dundie."

192
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:26,990
- Sing it Elton !
- Hey thanks guys !

193
00:14:27,047 --> 00:14:30,062
- Hey where you guys from ?
- We has came from your mama's house.

194
00:14:30,157 --> 00:14:31,341
Hey guys can I finish that ?

195
00:14:33,556 --> 00:14:34,843
Sing on a song dude !

196
00:14:34,846 --> 00:14:38,771
You know what guys we're just having
a little office party so if you wanna...

197
00:14:38,856 --> 00:14:46,480
- Hey ! You know cool it guys !
- You suck man ! You suck !

198
00:14:49,795 --> 00:14:52,780
Let's cut it !

199
00:14:55,436 --> 00:15:02,572
I've a few more Dundies to give out tonight,
but I'm just gonna cut it short, and rapid up.

200
00:15:02,618 --> 00:15:05,791
So everybody can enjoy their food.

201
00:15:06,036 --> 00:15:09,330
Thanks for listening,
those of you who listened.

202
00:15:09,795 --> 00:15:11,551
This last Dundee is for Kevin,

203
00:15:11,556 --> 00:15:15,190
this is the "don't go in there after me"
award, it's for the time that

204
00:15:15,326 --> 00:15:21,012
I went to the bathroom after him and
it was really, really smelly, so.

205
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:24,971
Here you go.

206
00:15:31,085 --> 00:15:38,220
Yeah Kevin, for Kevin,
for stinking up the bathroom !

207
00:15:40,926 --> 00:15:45,141
- Hey I haven't gotten one yet !
- Yes, I have not gotten one either !

208
00:15:45,186 --> 00:15:47,363
So keep going !
- More Dundies !

209
00:15:47,385 --> 00:15:52,720
Dundies ! - Dundies !

210
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:56,022
All right, we'll keep 'em rolling.

211
00:15:56,027 --> 00:16:01,931
This is the fine work award, this goes to
Stanley, for all the fine work he did this year.

212
00:16:02,217 --> 00:16:03,913
You know you did !

213
00:16:05,857 --> 00:16:08,763
Speech-speech-speech-speech

214
00:16:08,796 --> 00:16:14,052
Well, last year I got great
work, so I don't know...

215
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:16,842
I don't know what to think about this award,

216
00:16:16,998 --> 00:16:21,301
but at least I didn't get smelliest
bow movement like Kevin !

217
00:16:25,016 --> 00:16:28,771
And this next award is going
out to our own little Pam Beesly,

218
00:16:28,776 --> 00:16:32,091
I think we all know what award
Pam is gonna be getting this year,

219
00:16:32,136 --> 00:16:39,061
It is the whitest sneakers award, because
she always has the whitest tennis shoes on !

220
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:45,530
Get on down here ! Pam Beesly
ladies and gentlemen ! Here we go !

221
00:16:47,265 --> 00:16:51,500
I have so many people
to thank for this award !

222
00:16:52,227 --> 00:16:59,352
Ok, first off, my Keds, because I couldn't
have done it without them, thank you.

223
00:16:59,498 --> 00:17:05,852
Let's give Michael a round of applause for
MC-ing tonight because this is a lot harder than it looks,

224
00:17:06,376 --> 00:17:09,272
and also because of Dwight too.

225
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:14,300
Finally I want to thank God,

226
00:17:14,946 --> 00:17:18,251
because God gave me this Dundee,

227
00:17:18,396 --> 00:17:22,322
and I feel God in this Chili's tonight.

228
00:17:24,787 --> 00:17:29,510
Pam Beesly ladies and
gentlemen ! Ow, thank you !

229
00:17:41,176 --> 00:17:43,292
What a great year for the Dundies !

230
00:17:43,346 --> 00:17:48,723
We got to see Ping, and we learned Michael's
true feelings for Ryan, which was touching.

231
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:54,481
And we heard Michael change the lyrics to a
number of classic songs, which for me,

232
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,632
has ruined them for life !

233
00:17:58,568 --> 00:18:00,672
- What ?
- Nothing.

234
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:04,260
-  Okay.
- What ?

235
00:18:04,328 --> 00:18:06,292
I don't know, what ?

236
00:18:07,005 --> 00:18:12,510
Oh my god ! You are so
drunk ! Did you get that ?

237
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:15,411
Please tell me that you got,
this is all gonna be on.

238
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:19,152
- It's ok I'm a sheriff's deputy.
- Well, he's volunteer !

239
00:18:19,177 --> 00:18:20,342
Don't get into that now. 

240
00:18:20,357 --> 00:18:23,873
We need something
to caution her head, throw a pillow, a cush ?

241
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,170
- Dwight come on !
- I'm gonna use my shirt.

242
00:18:25,197 --> 00:18:26,882
- Get off of me !
- No !

243
00:18:27,135 --> 00:18:30,481
- I'm sorry, sir, you gotta have to put
your clothes back. We're trying to eat...

244
00:18:30,496 --> 00:18:33,512
Was this year's Dundies a
success ? Well, let me see :

245
00:18:33,527 --> 00:18:37,422
I made Pam laugh so hard that she fell out
of her chair and she almost broke her neck.

246
00:18:37,688 --> 00:18:40,020
So I killed, almost !

247
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:46,350
Oh my god ! I just wanna say that
this was the best Dundies ever !

248
00:18:50,007 --> 00:18:52,691
We have a strict policy here, not oversunk.

249
00:18:52,806 --> 00:18:56,670
Apparently this young woman was
sneaking drinks off other people's tables.

250
00:18:56,727 --> 00:19:02,121
Eyes at her officer driver's license and she is
not welcome at this restaurant chains ever again !

251
00:19:03,126 --> 00:19:04,730
- Great work tonight !
- Watch your step !

252
00:19:04,756 --> 00:19:05,742
Excellent.

253
00:19:05,788 --> 00:19:10,403
Thanks, I do check her pupils to
make sure that wasn't a concoction.

254
00:19:10,456 --> 00:19:15,063
Yes that too but I mean
with the audio, great work !

255
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:21,340
I feel bad about what I wrote
on the bathroom wall.

256
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:22,821
No you don't.

257
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:33,792
Oh, here she is. Careful.
All right, easy. Almost there.

258
00:19:33,927 --> 00:19:40,653
- Hey hum, can I ask you a question ?
- Shoot.

259
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:52,053
- I just wanted to say thanks.
- That's not really a question.

260
00:19:52,368 --> 00:19:54,740
Ok let's get you home, come.

261
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:01,823
- Good bye.
- Good night, have a good night.

262
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:03,292
Thank you Angela !

Oh ! there it is !

7
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:01,765
- What ?

8
00:01:03,956 --> 00:01:07,565
"50 signs that your priest
might be Michael Jackson"

9
00:01:08,705 --> 00:01:11,256
Well done ! Topical !

10
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:14,080
I am king of forwards !

11
00:01:14,143 --> 00:01:16,136
it's how I like to do business.

12
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,940
Everybody joking around !

13
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,626
We're like Friends.

14
00:01:19,889 --> 00:01:22,481
I am Chandler,

15
00:01:22,648 --> 00:01:24,013
and Joey,

16
00:01:24,786 --> 00:01:27,833
and Pam is Rachel,

17
00:01:28,587 --> 00:01:31,361
and Dwight is Kramer.

18
00:01:31,548 --> 00:01:35,310
So the monkey does the
sex thing, right here !

19
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,793
Funny ! that's funny !

20
00:01:40,025 --> 00:01:43,713
Not offensive because
it's nature, educational.

21
00:01:43,995 --> 00:01:48,033
Do you want the link ? cause then
you could forward it around.

22
00:01:48,048 --> 00:01:48,812
Consider it.

23
00:01:49,778 --> 00:01:51,033
Maybe.

24
00:01:51,228 --> 00:01:52,392
Well, we'll see.

25
00:01:53,115 --> 00:01:55,020
Because I don't know if it's...

26
00:01:55,088 --> 00:01:55,772
Come on !

27
00:01:55,776 --> 00:01:58,652
What has 2 thumbs and
likes to bone your mum ?

28
00:01:58,805 --> 00:01:59,783
This guy !

29
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:04,182
You are so bad !

30
00:02:06,828 --> 00:02:08,323
This guy is out of control !

31
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:09,953
He is a mad man !

32
00:02:09,985 --> 00:02:12,620
Better get the bleep
button ready for him.

33
00:02:14,397 --> 00:02:16,833
What's up Halpert ? Still queer ?

34
00:02:19,785 --> 00:02:23,611
Todd Packer, and I, are total BFF.

35
00:02:24,025 --> 00:02:25,233
Best Friends Forever.

36
00:02:25,276 --> 00:02:27,743
He and I came up together as salesman.

37
00:02:28,255 --> 00:02:31,742
One time we were out, and we met this

38
00:02:32,076 --> 00:02:33,843
set of twins,

39
00:02:33,907 --> 00:02:37,123
and Packer told them
that we were brothers.

40
00:02:37,926 --> 00:02:39,283
And so you know,

41
00:02:39,485 --> 00:02:40,653
one thing lead to another,

42
00:02:40,765 --> 00:02:43,221
and we brought them back to the motel,

43
00:02:43,707 --> 00:02:46,303
and then Packer did both of them.

44
00:02:47,338 --> 00:02:48,520
It was awesome !

45
00:02:51,225 --> 00:02:51,570
Ok.

46
00:02:52,346 --> 00:02:53,540
Grade 'A' gossip

47
00:02:53,545 --> 00:02:56,020
Right now, Rendal, CFO,

48
00:02:56,145 --> 00:02:58,341
resigned, nobody knows why.

49
00:02:58,647 --> 00:03:01,071
Are you kidding ?
Everyone knows why !

50
00:03:01,106 --> 00:03:03,612
You don't know ? Oh ok,
check this out, all right.

51
00:03:03,637 --> 00:03:04,681
- So here's the story.
- Yeah ?

52
00:03:04,695 --> 00:03:08,752
So Rendal is nailing his secretary, 
right ? and she's totally incompetent.

53
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:12,920
Really ? here we go. 
Buckle up, it's going to be a bumpy one.

54
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:15,531
We're talking blond incompetent. Right?

55
00:03:15,835 --> 00:03:17,540
Like ten words a minute...

56
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:18,343
talking !

57
00:03:18,715 --> 00:03:20,951
Well to be fair blondes,
brunettes, sit down,

58
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,521
there are lot of dumb people out there.

59
00:03:22,605 --> 00:03:24,231
They are women, right ?

60
00:03:25,447 --> 00:03:27,013
I didn't say it !

61
00:03:27,046 --> 00:03:27,870
I said it !

62
00:03:29,515 --> 00:03:31,893
And then, suddenly for no reasons,

63
00:03:31,926 --> 00:03:36,122
this bimbo blows the whistle on the
whole thing, just to be a bitch !

64
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:38,453
What have I told you
about the bleep button !

65
00:03:38,627 --> 00:03:39,312
Hey,

66
00:03:39,446 --> 00:03:41,822
What has 2 thumbs and hates Todd Packer ?

67
00:03:41,957 --> 00:03:43,123
This guy !

68
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:44,881
Meant to ask you

69
00:03:44,885 --> 00:03:49,190
Do you think you can get someone to drive
me around because of the DUI situation ?

70
00:03:49,498 --> 00:03:50,470
Bad boy !

71
00:03:51,385 --> 00:03:52,852
Ryan ?

72
00:03:53,485 --> 00:03:55,870
Come on kid, let's go.

73
00:03:56,338 --> 00:04:00,641
- Man, Todd Packer could do anything.
- Except pass that breathalyzer.

74
00:04:05,748 --> 00:04:09,382
-  You a big William Hung fan?
- Why does everybody ask me that ?

75
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:10,851
Who the hell is that ?

76
00:04:16,737 --> 00:04:19,281
- I'm really excited to meet you mum !
- You are ?

77
00:04:19,578 --> 00:04:21,562
My mum is coming in to visit.

78
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:25,422
She lives likes 2 hours away,
and she doesn't have a cell phone,

79
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:29,590
which is cool, cause it's kind of
adding some suspense to my day

80
00:04:29,628 --> 00:04:32,553
I keep looking over at the
door, hoping she'll walk in !

81
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:35,851
I've decided to show her around,
she really wants to meet everybody.

82
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:39,173
Oh yeah ? good, cause
I've a lot of questions.

83
00:04:39,355 --> 00:04:40,671
- Oh really ?
- Yeah.

84
00:04:40,908 --> 00:04:46,552
As a child, did Pam show any traits that would
endorse her future career as a receptionist ?

85
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:51,540
Hey, send me that link
to the monkey sex video,

86
00:04:51,716 --> 00:04:54,720
- I'm going to forward it like it's hot.
- Yes !

87
00:04:54,905 --> 00:04:59,271
Forward it like it's hot. Old school !

88
00:04:59,655 --> 00:05:02,721
- Michael ?
- Yes Tobby ?

89
00:05:03,157 --> 00:05:06,913
I need to talk to you in your office,
it will just take 2 seconds.

90
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:09,260
Literally 2 seconds ?

91
00:05:09,538 --> 00:05:13,221
Tobby is an HR, which technically
means he works for corporate.

92
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:16,701
So he's really not a part of our family.

93
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:20,650
Also he's divorced, so he's
really not a part of his family.

94
00:05:20,735 --> 00:05:24,060
The full story is that Rendal resigned
because of sexual harassment,

95
00:05:24,205 --> 00:05:28,203
so corporate asks me to do a 5 minutes review
of the company sexual harassment policy.

96
00:05:28,215 --> 00:05:29,593
No no Tobby. No.

97
00:05:29,827 --> 00:05:33,801
- It's really not a big deal, Michael.
- It is a big deal, it's a big deal !

98
00:05:33,825 --> 00:05:39,302
What are we supposed to do ? Scrutinize
every little thing we say and do all day ?

99
00:05:39,318 --> 00:05:40,652
I mean, come on !

100
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,803
And then corporate is
gonna send in a lawyer.

101
00:05:42,808 --> 00:05:43,360
What ?

102
00:05:43,365 --> 00:05:47,633
- Just to fresh you on our policy.
- No. What ? No.

103
00:05:47,658 --> 00:05:51,492
Okay, what is a lawyer
going to come in and tell us?

104
00:05:51,506 --> 00:05:55,180
to not send out hilarious
e-mails, or not tell jokes ?

105
00:05:55,216 --> 00:05:58,602
Maybe not some of them,
maybe not inappropriate ones.

106
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:02,343
There is no such thing as inappropriate
joke, that's why it's a joke !

107
00:06:02,675 --> 00:06:05,021
Everyone, hello ? everyone, hi !

108
00:06:05,505 --> 00:06:07,663
Sorry to interrupt I know you're all busy,

109
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:10,992
and the last thing you want
is for a major interruption.

110
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:12,730
But  Tobby has an announcement,

111
00:06:12,745 --> 00:06:16,772
that he insists on making right now in
the middle of the day, so take it away.

112
00:06:16,817 --> 00:06:18,280
Yeah, ok.

113
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:22,900
Corporate would like us to do a 5 minute review
with the company sexual harassment policy,

114
00:06:22,906 --> 00:06:24,421
so I'll go over that later.

115
00:06:24,588 --> 00:06:26,540
I wish you luck Tobby, I really do.

116
00:06:26,606 --> 00:06:28,941
But you are going to have
a mutiny on your hands and

117
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,921
I just can't wait to see
how you handle it.

118
00:06:32,278 --> 00:06:36,841
A guy goes to a 5$ lady of the night,

119
00:06:36,988 --> 00:06:39,842
and he gets crabs.

120
00:06:39,895 --> 00:06:42,550
So the next day
he goes back to complain.

121
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:47,770
And the woman says :
"Hey, it was only 5$,

122
00:06:47,968 --> 00:06:51,901
what did you expect, lobster ?"

123
00:06:53,027 --> 00:06:55,560
This is what's at stake.

124
00:07:01,665 --> 00:07:03,660
Time to bring out the big guns.

125
00:07:03,725 --> 00:07:07,511
I'm heading down to the warehouse,
where jokes are born.

126
00:07:07,626 --> 00:07:11,722
Find a killer joke that will just blow 
everybody away at the ceminar later.

127
00:07:11,928 --> 00:07:15,521
And, remind them, what
is great about this place.

128
00:07:15,586 --> 00:07:17,763
So, here they are !

129
00:07:17,827 --> 00:07:21,761
Guys, wondering if I could
get your help for something.

130
00:07:21,837 --> 00:07:24,323
I'm looking for a new joke to tell,

131
00:07:24,347 --> 00:07:28,311
and it needs to be just killer,
and it does not need to be clean.

132
00:07:28,525 --> 00:07:31,603
- What you've got ?
- Like a joke ? A knock knock joke?

133
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:33,671
Yeah, no. Better, better than that.

134
00:07:33,675 --> 00:07:36,011
Let's have the type you
guys tell all day.

135
00:07:36,035 --> 00:07:41,142
Well, those are some awful tight pants
you have on, where did you get them like

136
00:07:41,565 --> 00:07:43,621
Q ueers'r'us ?

137
00:07:43,687 --> 00:07:44,982
Boys'r'us !

138
00:07:45,835 --> 00:07:48,721
All right, but you know,

139
00:07:48,965 --> 00:07:51,291
a joke but not necessarily
at my expense.

140
00:07:51,397 --> 00:07:52,633
- so work out.
- Well we can see...

141
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:55,620
all of your business coming
around the corner ok ?

142
00:07:55,637 --> 00:08:00,840
you need to, hide that? Good thing you 
don't have a lot of business to start with.

143
00:08:00,998 --> 00:08:03,180
Oh ok. That was still about me.

144
00:08:03,273 --> 00:08:06,376
Hey, so you don't have the
biggest package, don't feel bad !

145
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:08,730
- I don't feel bad !
- I think he feels bad.

146
00:08:08,756 --> 00:08:10,456
- No I don't !
- You look like you feel bad !

147
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:12,100
- Your little package !
- Well, you know,

148
00:08:12,147 --> 00:08:14,850
not exactly what I was looking
for but thanks guys ! Thank you !

149
00:08:12,388 --> 00:08:14,822
<i>Little package !</i>

150
00:08:14,906 --> 00:08:17,593
- You look good in those pants.
- he got it from his mama !

151
00:08:20,137 --> 00:08:23,023
So remember intent is
irrelevant. And that's it.

152
00:08:23,106 --> 00:08:24,142
Pam ?

153
00:08:24,247 --> 00:08:29,270
I just wanted to say that just
my mum is coming in today.

154
00:08:29,318 --> 00:08:33,162
- MILF !
- Thanks Kevin.

155
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:35,641
Usually the day we talk
about sexual harassment,

156
00:08:35,658 --> 00:08:38,173
is the day that everyone
harasses me as a joke.

157
00:08:38,246 --> 00:08:39,233
She's coming in today,

158
00:08:39,235 --> 00:08:42,232
and maybe just don't joke around
about that stuff in front of her.

159
00:08:42,295 --> 00:08:44,143
- Great point.
- Thank you.

160
00:08:44,595 --> 00:08:49,201
In fact, basic rule of thumb : let's just act
everyday likes Pam's mum coming in.

161
00:08:49,867 --> 00:08:53,443
All right that's it, anybody has
any questions about anything,

162
00:08:53,506 --> 00:08:54,672
you know where I sit in the back.

163
00:08:57,395 --> 00:08:59,832
- Hi ! Is it over ?
- Yes.

164
00:08:59,856 --> 00:09:02,741
- I can go over it with you.
- I know, I know it's good.

165
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:07,450
It is not over until it's over.
Did he tell you everything ?

166
00:09:04,995 --> 00:09:06,021
<i>It's over.</i>

167
00:09:07,726 --> 00:09:11,690
Obviously he didn't because you
all still look relatively happy,

168
00:09:11,836 --> 00:09:13,262
Albeit, bored.

169
00:09:13,677 --> 00:09:16,110
Do you realize what we
are losing ? seriously ?

170
00:09:16,145 --> 00:09:17,420
E-mail forwards ?

171
00:09:17,727 --> 00:09:19,243
Exactly !

172
00:09:19,716 --> 00:09:23,870
Can we afford to lose e-mail
forwards ? Do we want that ?

173
00:09:24,045 --> 00:09:26,871
I hate them, you send
me these filthy e-mails,

174
00:09:26,876 --> 00:09:30,311
and you say forward them to
10 people or you'll have bad luck.

175
00:09:30,455 --> 00:09:31,781
Give me a break.

176
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:37,012
Stanley, how about that hot
picture you have by your desk ?

177
00:09:37,387 --> 00:09:39,480
Centerfold in a catholic schoolgirls outfit ?

178
00:09:39,518 --> 00:09:44,002
I mean it is hot, it is sexy and
it turns him on and I will admit,

179
00:09:44,086 --> 00:09:46,840
that best part of my
mornings is staring at it.

180
00:09:46,856 --> 00:09:48,452
But what ? are we gonna just take it away ?

181
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:51,551
That is my daughter, she goes
to Catholic girls school,

182
00:09:51,655 --> 00:09:53,401
I'm taking it down right now.

183
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:58,190
- What about office romance ?
- Office relationships are...

184
00:09:58,296 --> 00:10:01,231
never a good idea so
let's just try to avoid them.

185
00:10:01,275 --> 00:10:04,680
But if you already have one,
you should disclose it to HR.

186
00:10:05,286 --> 00:10:08,372
All relationships ?
even a one night stand ?

187
00:10:09,336 --> 00:10:11,041
I think the old honor system was fine.

188
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:15,693
For example I have never slept with an
employee, and believe me I could have.

189
00:10:16,126 --> 00:10:18,560
- Yeah Meredith !
- No no Catherine,

190
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:22,280
remember her ? remember how hot she was ?
She would have definitely slept with me.

191
00:10:20,196 --> 00:10:20,640
<i>Yes !</i>

192
00:10:22,297 --> 00:10:24,421
- She wasn't that hot !
- Yes she was !

193
00:10:24,506 --> 00:10:26,211
- Damn it Kevin ! come o...
- Ok, you know Michael...

194
00:10:26,328 --> 00:10:28,640
I'm in an office relationship.

195
00:10:28,966 --> 00:10:32,411
It's special. She's nice, she's shy,

196
00:10:32,537 --> 00:10:36,310
she's actually here if you wanna
meet her, hold on one second.

197
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,133
Oh my god ! put on a shirt !

198
00:10:40,358 --> 00:10:42,920
put on... I told you
that you'd be on camera !

199
00:10:43,015 --> 00:10:46,651
I'm sorry she's European.
No I told you that you'd be on camera !

200
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:49,043
Stop it !

201
00:10:49,355 --> 00:10:51,731
What if Pam was a lesbian ?

202
00:10:52,816 --> 00:10:57,270
What if she brought her "partner" into
work ? will that be crossing the line ?

203
00:10:57,355 --> 00:10:57,793
No !

204
00:10:57,806 --> 00:11:00,140
What if they made out,
in front of everybody ?

205
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:02,563
- Well that would be...
- at home !

206
00:11:02,616 --> 00:11:06,000
and I told everybody everything about it.

207
00:11:07,077 --> 00:11:09,853
- Okay I'm lost.
- Okay, well then let's act it out !

208
00:11:09,968 --> 00:11:15,002
Pam, you will be girl A,
and girl B will be...

209
00:11:15,155 --> 00:11:16,843
Okay we'll use the doll.

210
00:11:18,317 --> 00:11:21,261
Pam ? Pam ?

211
00:11:24,586 --> 00:11:27,452
I wish Todd Packer was here,
cause he would love this.

212
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:30,041
I wonder if anybody else
would like to join us.

213
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:32,281
Ooh, it's coming out of my mouth.Hey !

214
00:11:33,228 --> 00:11:35,270
We have to watch Tobby's video,

215
00:11:35,287 --> 00:11:38,271
that he's, uh, showing us in order
to brain wash us and now I was wondering

216
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:39,962
if anybody like to join-in ?

217
00:11:40,187 --> 00:11:43,673
It could be fun ! Got microwave pizza.
What do you say ?

218
00:11:44,197 --> 00:11:45,890
- Jim ?
- No thanks I'm good.

219
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,720
That's what she said.

220
00:11:48,405 --> 00:11:51,351
- Pam ?
- My mother's coming.

221
00:11:51,437 --> 00:11:55,783
That's what she said. No,
but ok, well suit yourself.

222
00:11:57,305 --> 00:11:59,580
- Hey Tobby.
- Hey Dwight.

223
00:11:59,755 --> 00:12:02,652
You said that we could come
to you if we had any questions ?

224
00:12:02,716 --> 00:12:03,491
Sure.

225
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,233
Where is the clitoris ?

226
00:12:12,736 --> 00:12:17,390
On a website it said at
the crest of the labia.

227
00:12:18,807 --> 00:12:20,400
What does that mean ?

228
00:12:24,355 --> 00:12:26,821
What is the female vagina look like ?

229
00:12:27,176 --> 00:12:29,293
Technically I am in human resources,

230
00:12:29,307 --> 00:12:32,292
and Dwight was asking
me about human anatomy.

231
00:12:33,656 --> 00:12:39,020
I'm just sad the, public school system
failed him so badly.

232
00:12:39,297 --> 00:12:42,332
You know, maybe when you get
really comfortable with each other,

233
00:12:42,377 --> 00:12:48,092
- you can ask for that.
- Good. Good. And...

234
00:12:48,137 --> 00:12:51,412
-  I should get back to work.
- Ok.

235
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:53,882
<i> In today's fast paced business climate,</i>

236
00:12:53,926 --> 00:12:57,541
<i>it can sometimes be hard to know
when a comment or an action,</i>

237
00:12:57,656 --> 00:12:58,830
<i>crosses the line.</i>

238
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:02,502
<i>Let's take a look at a couple of
scenarios and ask ourselves : </i>

239
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,841
<i>"Where is the line ?" </i>

240
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:08,402
Natural Redhead

241
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:11,250
<i>-Hey Rach !
- Hey Joe, Mike !</i>

242
00:13:11,427 --> 00:13:15,813
<i>Hey settle a bet : are
you a natural redhead ?</i>

243
00:13:16,215 --> 00:13:20,791
Oh my... ! Hey, stop the video !
Stop it right this, stop it right there !

244
00:13:22,587 --> 00:13:24,820
That's the girl from that thing,

245
00:13:25,485 --> 00:13:27,162
I banged this girl, right here.

246
00:13:27,215 --> 00:13:29,520
- That's her ?
- Yes, this is the one, you remember ?

247
00:13:29,556 --> 00:13:31,032
- The party ?
- You banged her ?

248
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:33,280
Right here, you are a naughty girl !

249
00:13:33,327 --> 00:13:36,753
Ok, hypocrite, she is a hypocrite !

250
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:39,321
That is such a scam ! Ok !

251
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:44,572
Yes, yes I did. Ok. But we
can talk about that later.

252
00:13:45,118 --> 00:13:48,302
You are not gonna believe this, the
girl in the video we are watching,

253
00:13:48,317 --> 00:13:51,681
the corporate gave us,
Darryl banged her !

254
00:13:54,608 --> 00:13:58,690
And he's about 90% sure.

255
00:14:01,577 --> 00:14:05,571
Don't ever let this little bitch drive you
 around town we got lost for half an hour.

256
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:08,512
I don't have any DUI so
I can drive myself, but thanks.

257
00:14:08,726 --> 00:14:12,722
Where is Michael Snot ?
Sniffing some dude stone ?

258
00:14:13,548 --> 00:14:15,121
Probably.

259
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:20,132
So you are the lawyer, Mr. O’Malley,
I know a lot of lawyer jokes.

260
00:14:20,146 --> 00:14:23,903
- I love lawyer jokes.
- Well it's probably cause you don't get 'em.

261
00:14:24,225 --> 00:14:26,583
When I said before that
I was king of forwards,

262
00:14:26,598 --> 00:14:29,882
you gotta understand that
I don't come up with these stuff.

263
00:14:30,006 --> 00:14:32,040
I just forward it along.

264
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:37,131
You wouldn't arrest a guy who is just
delivering drugs from one guy to another.

265
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,100
You seem a little bit agitated
Michael what's the problem ?

266
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:46,272
The problem is that I am the boss
and apparently I can't say anything.

267
00:14:48,238 --> 00:14:53,113
Well, that's true, in a way,
you can't say anything.

268
00:14:53,415 --> 00:14:55,472
Where's the line ?
Where's the line Jan ?

269
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,962
- Do you need to see the video again, Michael ?
- No, I've seen the video.

270
00:14:57,975 --> 00:15:00,573
- He talked the all time.
- No I didn't !

271
00:15:02,607 --> 00:15:03,302
What ?

272
00:15:08,758 --> 00:15:10,370
Attention everyone, hello ?

273
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:14,263
Yes, I just want you to know
that this is not my decision,

274
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:18,932
but from here on out, we
can no longer be friends.

275
00:15:20,527 --> 00:15:27,613
And when we talk about things here, we
must only discuss a work associated things.

276
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:31,682
And you can consider this
my retirement from comedy.

277
00:15:32,157 --> 00:15:36,111
And in the future if I want to
say something funny, or witty,

278
00:15:36,156 --> 00:15:39,310
or do an impression,
I will no longer,

279
00:15:39,427 --> 00:15:42,612
ever, do any of those things.

280
00:15:42,766 --> 00:15:47,941
- Does that include "That's what she said" ?
- Yes.

281
00:15:48,007 --> 00:15:50,612
Well that is really hard. 

282
00:15:51,465 --> 00:15:53,822
You really think you can go all day long ?

283
00:15:55,225 --> 00:15:59,493
Well you always leave me
satisfied and smiling so.

284
00:16:00,808 --> 00:16:02,103
That's what she said !

285
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,750
Michael, Michael !

286
00:16:04,808 --> 00:16:05,901
- Come on !
- Michael please.

287
00:16:05,926 --> 00:16:07,493
- Here he is.
- Please.

288
00:16:08,727 --> 00:16:09,902
Good one !

289
00:16:09,955 --> 00:16:12,673
You would have done the same,
you just didn't think of it first.

290
00:16:12,758 --> 00:16:16,590
Michael  please, that's
not my sense of humor.

291
00:16:16,647 --> 00:16:21,893
Hello ! Jan, Mr. O’Malley,
this is my lawyer James P. Albiny,

292
00:16:20,825 --> 00:16:21,873
<i>Your what ?</i>

293
00:16:21,935 --> 00:16:25,191
I believe you may recognize
his face from the billboards.

294
00:16:25,406 --> 00:16:28,223
He's specializes in free speech issues.

295
00:16:28,317 --> 00:16:32,170
And motorcycle head injuries, workers
comp., and die appeal lawsuits.

296
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:34,641
- This guy does it all.
- Excuse me, I'm sorry.

297
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,753
Michael, Mr. O’Malley is your lawyer.

298
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:38,992
What ?

299
00:16:39,547 --> 00:16:42,422
Mr. O’Malley is our corporate lawyer,

300
00:16:42,455 --> 00:16:45,053
we have him on retainer,
to protect the company,

301
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:48,122
as well as upper level
management, such as yourself.

302
00:16:50,797 --> 00:16:51,902
So I'm not in trouble ?

303
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,712
I am so used to being the bad boy.

304
00:16:54,718 --> 00:16:57,312
I am so used to fighting corporate,

305
00:16:57,347 --> 00:17:00,622
that I forget that I am corporate,
upper management.

306
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:04,960
They hooked me up with
an attorney, to protect me.

307
00:17:06,646 --> 00:17:11,950
You can't be too careful about what
you say, more money more problems.

308
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:15,272
Ok well let's get you out of here James !

309
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:17,293
I think we're under an hour still so...

310
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:19,681
Yeah but I did a lot of paperwork
at home before I got here !

311
00:17:19,685 --> 00:17:22,253
We'll talk about it later,
thanks for coming in !

312
00:17:26,906 --> 00:17:30,382
- Hello.
- Oh my god !

313
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:32,211
- Hi honey !
- Hello !

314
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:33,280
I love my mum.

315
00:17:34,218 --> 00:17:37,353
Okay, that's probably the
most obvious statement ever.

316
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,340
- This is all yours ?
- Yeah, I'm in charge of this...

317
00:17:40,366 --> 00:17:43,073
Oh my godness.

318
00:17:50,165 --> 00:17:51,782
So a guy goes home and tells his wife :

319
00:17:51,787 --> 00:17:54,160
"Honey, pack your bags,
I just won the lottery"

320
00:17:54,176 --> 00:17:57,012
she was "Oh my god ! that's
incredible, where are we going ?"

321
00:17:57,028 --> 00:18:01,130
He goes "I don't know where you're
going just be out of here by five !"

322
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:09,721
- This is where I used to keep my computer.
- All right, I remember with the picture.

323
00:18:09,758 --> 00:18:13,321
Yeah, yeah but I switch stuff
around because I actually needed

324
00:18:13,327 --> 00:18:16,003
like more room for organization.
- Sure.

325
00:18:16,065 --> 00:18:20,672
- This is like... organization station.
- Oh there he is.

326
00:18:21,085 --> 00:18:22,770
- Hey handsome.
- You look great.

327
00:18:22,786 --> 00:18:26,093
Oh thank you. So,
we're ready for dinner ?

328
00:18:26,317 --> 00:18:29,421
Well, you know, actually
I kind of need to stall a bit

329
00:18:29,506 --> 00:18:33,191
but it's ok because I am
very used to get in time.

330
00:18:34,856 --> 00:18:38,332
I'm gonna go wait in the parking lot and
what kinda tunes you want for the ride !

331
00:18:38,356 --> 00:18:41,942
- You're classical or oldies ?
- Anything is fine.

332
00:18:42,498 --> 00:18:44,583
Ok, well see ya !

333
00:18:47,578 --> 00:18:50,782
- So, which one is Jim ?
- Mum !

334
00:18:51,576 --> 00:18:53,342
- Just wanted to know.
- No !

335
00:18:53,437 --> 00:18:55,413
- All right. Ok.
- Ten minutes,

336
00:18:55,505 --> 00:18:57,611
- Then we can go to dinner.
- I'll make myself busy.

337
00:18:57,956 --> 00:19:00,653
There's this guy he's
at a nymphomaniac convention,

338
00:19:01,068 --> 00:19:03,553
And he is psyched 'cause all
these women are smoking hot

339
00:19:03,587 --> 00:19:06,843
perfect tens except for this
one chick who looks a lot like...

340
00:19:07,017 --> 00:19:10,362
- Phyllis ?
- No no no no, that crosses the line.

341
00:19:10,435 --> 00:19:15,923
- Ex-squeeze me ?
- Not you. Kevin,

342
00:19:16,398 --> 00:19:19,743
just unwarranted it, hostile
work environment Kevin.

343
00:19:19,836 --> 00:19:22,213
- Packer said it.
- No, you said it.

344
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:24,453
He pointed, a point is not a say.

345
00:19:24,587 --> 00:19:28,381
Look, Kevin, we are a family here,

346
00:19:28,838 --> 00:19:31,663
and Phyllis is a valuable member
of that family, like a grand-mother.

347
00:19:31,846 --> 00:19:34,043
- I'm the same age as you Michael.
- Well I don't know about that.

348
00:19:34,058 --> 00:19:36,383
- We were the same high school class.
- Well, I've late birthdays,

349
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,730
usually Septembers a cut off point...

350
00:19:39,087 --> 00:19:42,213
You know what you just
crossed the line, ok ?

351
00:19:42,255 --> 00:19:46,140
There is a line, and you went
over it, and you must be punished.

352
00:19:46,157 --> 00:19:47,590
So go to your corner.

353
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:51,150
- You mean where my desk is ?
- Yes to your corner, go.

354
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:55,271
Ok, I have a lot of
work to do anyway.

355
00:19:55,466 --> 00:19:58,783
Oh my ! They really got
to you, didn't they ?

356
00:19:58,826 --> 00:20:03,651
They didn't get to
me, I got to them.

357
00:20:03,895 --> 00:20:09,412
I am still the same old Michael
Scott, new and improved.

358
00:20:10,158 --> 00:20:13,473
You know what ? I love Phyllis, 

359
00:20:14,997 --> 00:20:18,670
you know what else ?
I think she is gorgeous,

360
00:20:18,987 --> 00:20:23,370
I think she is an incredibly,
incredibly attractive person.

361
00:20:24,376 --> 00:20:26,173
Come here, give me a kiss, come on !

362
00:20:26,198 --> 00:20:31,601
Michael come on you don't have to worry
I'm not gonna report you to HR.

363
00:20:29,888 --> 00:20:31,572
<i>I'm not worried.</i>

364
00:20:31,638 --> 00:20:37,022
You know what, the only thing I am
worried about, is getting a boner.

365
00:20:38,178 --> 00:20:40,420
Good work today everybody.

366
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,640
Times  have changed a little.

367
00:20:48,088 --> 00:20:52,242
And even now we're still a family
here at Dundler Mifflin, families grow.

368
00:20:52,907 --> 00:20:58,751
And at some point the daddy can't
take a bath with the kids anymore.

369
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:00,880
I am upper management, and

370
00:21:01,656 --> 00:21:05,543
it would be inappropriate for
me to take a bath with Pam,

371
00:21:05,808 --> 00:21:07,982
as much as I might want to.

372
00:21:08,228 --> 00:21:09,573
He said what ???



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

1
00:00:00,925 --> 00:00:03,484
I'm an early bird, and I'm a night owl,

2
00:00:03,535 --> 00:00:06,673
so I'm wise, and I have worms.

3
00:00:07,191 --> 00:00:09,773
So... oh breakfast

4
00:00:09,985 --> 00:00:12,038
I got your sausage,
egg and cheese biscuit.

5
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:14,647
Yummy yummy ! thank you Ryan.

6
00:00:16,595 --> 00:00:20,597
What was the thing you needed me
to come in early for ?

7
00:00:22,785 --> 00:00:24,914
The sausage, egg and cheese biscuit.

8
00:00:24,965 --> 00:00:30,012
But thank you, and why don't
you just take a couple hours,

9
00:00:30,013 --> 00:00:32,616
office is yours, home alone,

10
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,610
risky business.

11
00:00:34,613 --> 00:00:36,656
Take your pants off, run around.

12
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:39,620
Whatever you wanna do ?

13
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:43,056
I'm just gonna take a nap
in my car until work starts.

14
00:00:44,529 --> 00:00:48,380
Healtheir, gotta watch those carbs.

15
00:01:18,035 --> 00:01:21,222
2x03 : Office Olympics

http://pmag.f2o.org/theofficeus/

16
00:01:22,175 --> 00:01:25,561
Today I, Michael Scott, am
becoming an home-owner.

17
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:28,310
- Investing in real estate.
- Diversifying, smart !

18
00:01:28,397 --> 00:01:30,560
Yes it is. Yes it is.

19
00:01:31,285 --> 00:01:33,861
It is very important to own a property.

20
00:01:34,218 --> 00:01:37,622
Back in olden days, they
would not even let you vote,

21
00:01:37,738 --> 00:01:39,960
unless you own a property and
they threw you in the stacks,

22
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,372
and then humiliate you.

23
00:01:41,445 --> 00:01:42,541
- And it worked !
- Yes.

24
00:01:42,547 --> 00:01:43,622
They should bring the stocks back

25
00:01:43,648 --> 00:01:45,621
people would obey the law,
there'd be less trouble makers.

26
00:01:45,645 --> 00:01:46,903
Maybe !

27
00:01:54,606 --> 00:01:57,803
<i>Every so often, Jim dies of boredom.</i>

28
00:01:58,358 --> 00:02:01,620
I think today it was the
expense reports that did him in.

29
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,362
And our deal is, that
it's up to me to revive him.

30
00:02:05,857 --> 00:02:07,721
You see Dwight's coffee mug ?

31
00:02:07,956 --> 00:02:09,342
Sometimes when he's not here,

32
00:02:09,385 --> 00:02:11,561
- I try to throw stuff in it.
- No way !

33
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:16,670
Let's do this !

34
00:02:20,696 --> 00:02:22,571
Here, try paper-clips.

35
00:02:23,586 --> 00:02:26,561
Oh wait, this message, for Dwight.

36
00:02:30,855 --> 00:02:33,753
- You should go.
- Yes, yes, final walkthrough.

37
00:02:34,325 --> 00:02:35,810
Sign the papers at the condo.

38
00:02:35,816 --> 00:02:37,862
- You'll have your lawyer there ?
- I don't need one.

39
00:02:37,876 --> 00:02:39,320
- Can I be your representative ?
- I don't need repr...

40
00:02:39,337 --> 00:02:40,800
- I think I should be there.
- No, no.

41
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,250
- No I'm good I can make
sure things are up to code.
- No, Dwight.

42
00:02:43,276 --> 00:02:45,442
Please, am I not always the
guy that you rely on at work ?

43
00:02:45,495 --> 00:02:46,853
Well, this isn't about work.

44
00:02:46,858 --> 00:02:49,710
This is closing on a condo,
it's completely personal.

45
00:02:49,735 --> 00:02:51,952
So you're taking a personal day ?

46
00:02:52,736 --> 00:02:56,771
Except that, it's about my
living arrangement, and as boss,

47
00:02:56,897 --> 00:02:58,791
I need to have a living arrangement,

48
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:02,761
- in order to do work.
- Please, I'll make you proud.

49
00:03:03,287 --> 00:03:05,640
- Ok fine, yes you can come.
- Yes, as your representative ?

50
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,233
- As my associate.
- Same thing.

51
00:03:07,265 --> 00:03:08,661
No it is not !

52
00:03:08,728 --> 00:03:12,043
I have been Michael's
number 2 guy for about five years,

53
00:03:12,087 --> 00:03:16,083
and we make a great team. We're like
one of those classic famous teams,

54
00:03:16,136 --> 00:03:18,260
he's like Mozart and I'm like,

55
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:20,462
Mozart's friend.

56
00:03:21,065 --> 00:03:25,801
No, I'm like Butch Cassidy,
and Michael is like

57
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:27,253
Mozart.

58
00:03:27,718 --> 00:03:29,733
You try and hurt Mozart,

59
00:03:29,906 --> 00:03:33,662
you're gonna get a bullet in your head,
courtesy of Butch Cassidy.

60
00:03:35,027 --> 00:03:37,772
Ah, most honorable Pamera

61
00:03:37,858 --> 00:03:40,210
not offensive because that's
the way they talk in movies.

62
00:03:40,238 --> 00:03:41,900
- You headed out ?
- We are,

63
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:44,072
Dwight and I are headed to a big thing

64
00:03:44,218 --> 00:03:47,183
why don't you have everybody
work on their expense reports

65
00:03:47,198 --> 00:03:48,992
and I'd like them in
by the end of the day.

66
00:03:48,998 --> 00:03:49,820
- Ok.
- Very good.

67
00:03:49,828 --> 00:03:50,961
- Have a great time !
- We will.

68
00:03:50,985 --> 00:03:53,613
Um did you do the thing
I asked you about the magazines ?

69
00:03:53,627 --> 00:03:55,131
Yeah I changed them to your new address.

70
00:03:55,155 --> 00:03:58,761
- Good, the Small Businessman ?
- Yep.

71
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:03,240
- Maxim ? American Way ? Cracked ?
- Yes,

72
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:07,002
I changed your Cracked
magazine subscription.

73
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:10,560
How about Fine Arts ?

74
00:04:11,528 --> 00:04:14,443
Aficionado  Monthly ?

75
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:19,252
No ? Ok well could you get on that ?
cause I don't just read Cracked.

76
00:04:19,356 --> 00:04:21,472
Thank you.
Ok, see you soon.

77
00:04:22,227 --> 00:04:24,401
What kind of shocks
you've got on this baby ?

78
00:04:24,486 --> 00:04:28,533
I don't know, regular, normal ones ?
Nothing fancy.

79
00:04:28,678 --> 00:04:31,032
Not my style.

80
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,170
- What are you doing ?
- I wanna put the top down.

81
00:04:33,245 --> 00:04:37,182
- Dwight it's 50° outside don't, please
- But then no one could see us.

82
00:04:37,255 --> 00:04:40,732
I... just... would you... put it up ?

83
00:04:40,897 --> 00:04:43,281
Ok, fine. Just leave it down.

84
00:04:43,446 --> 00:04:44,873
whiner !

85
00:04:46,367 --> 00:04:49,350
Check it out. I'm terminator.

86
00:04:49,407 --> 00:04:52,411
I do not understand what
you spend your money on ?

87
00:04:54,257 --> 00:04:56,810
Hey Oscar, on these new expense reports

88
00:04:56,826 --> 00:04:58,350
do we really have
to go back to last quarter ?

89
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,923
Yeah, it's a terrible system I know.

90
00:05:02,757 --> 00:05:05,352
What is 2005 Season here ?

91
00:05:06,417 --> 00:05:09,041
- Wait a minute what is this ?
- It's a score board.

92
00:05:09,098 --> 00:05:09,691
What ?

93
00:05:09,705 --> 00:05:12,522
Kevin and I play this paper
football game when Michael's out.

94
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:14,282
- Really ?
- Or when we are bored.

95
00:05:14,296 --> 00:05:16,041
Oh my god !

96
00:05:16,075 --> 00:05:18,091
Wait this goes back 2 years !

97
00:05:18,146 --> 00:05:20,043
We are bored a lot.

98
00:05:20,908 --> 00:05:22,483
- Ow !
- Sweet !

99
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:25,531
Yes, so close.

100
00:05:25,627 --> 00:05:29,491
I really love the paper triangle
flicking and hitting things game.

101
00:05:29,535 --> 00:05:32,272
- Yeah, we call it Hate Ball.
- Why ?

102
00:05:32,406 --> 00:05:34,922
Because of how much Angela hates it.

103
00:05:35,595 --> 00:05:37,482
Hey do you guys have many other games ?

104
00:05:37,506 --> 00:05:41,293
Sometimes we play "Who can put
the most M&M's in their mouth ?"

105
00:05:41,347 --> 00:05:42,521
You play that.

106
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:46,142
You should ask Toby
to teach you Dunder Ball.

107
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,732
Home Sweet Home.

108
00:05:50,056 --> 00:05:53,353
- Which one's yours ?
- Right there.

109
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:57,093
My sanctuary. My party pad.

110
00:05:57,446 --> 00:06:02,981
Someday  I can just see my grandkids
learning how to walk out here.

111
00:06:03,515 --> 00:06:08,232
Hang on and swing from
this tree, pushing back...

112
00:06:09,518 --> 00:06:13,042
Wait, no it's this one, right here.

113
00:06:13,328 --> 00:06:14,593
Home Sweet Home.

114
00:06:18,915 --> 00:06:21,733
So that's what this sound is all day !

115
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:24,802
Michael this is Bill he's the
head of the condo association.

116
00:06:24,825 --> 00:06:26,931
Hey how are you ? Nice to meet you Bill.

117
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,370
Bill, mister Bill,

118
00:06:28,396 --> 00:06:33,850
oh noooooo, mister Bill, oooooooh.

119
00:06:33,867 --> 00:06:37,440
S&L ? When they pull him apart.

120
00:06:38,047 --> 00:06:40,610
You could always get
rolled over by something.

121
00:06:40,836 --> 00:06:42,582
- Ni... nice to meet you...
- Nice to meet you too.

122
00:06:42,628 --> 00:06:44,302
This is smaller than your old place.

123
00:06:44,318 --> 00:06:47,112
Yes, well I'm buying it
and I'm not renting it.

124
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,632
So it's still an upgrade.

125
00:06:50,245 --> 00:06:52,691
He doesn't know anything
about property ownership.

126
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:53,980
He's kind of an idiot. 

127
00:06:54,627 --> 00:06:56,791
Actually, I do own property.

128
00:06:56,895 --> 00:06:59,742
My grandfather left me
a sixty acre working beet farm.

129
00:06:59,806 --> 00:07:01,771
I run it with my cousin Mose.

130
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:05,801
We sell beets to local
stores and restaurants,

131
00:07:06,247 --> 00:07:08,440
it's a nice old farm.

132
00:07:09,355 --> 00:07:11,860
Sometimes teenagers use it for sex.

133
00:07:12,175 --> 00:07:14,702
- Are we ready to sign some papers ?
- Actually no.

134
00:07:14,717 --> 00:07:16,692
We have a couple of questions,

135
00:07:16,746 --> 00:07:20,811
- about the neighborhood ?
- It's very safe, it's very clean,

136
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:24,743
also  it's very accepting
of all life styles.

137
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,022
It's a very gay friendly neighborhood.

138
00:07:29,755 --> 00:07:32,340
- Oh good, that's good.
- Yeah.

139
00:07:32,706 --> 00:07:35,551
It's good to be accommodating of that.

140
00:07:35,607 --> 00:07:37,981
Let's go check out the master bedroom.

141
00:07:38,588 --> 00:07:42,201
Stanley, I just played
Dunder Ball with Toby,

142
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,603
- What about you ? You got any games ?
- Yeah, I got a game,

143
00:07:44,618 --> 00:07:48,330
it's called work hard so
my kids can go to college.

144
00:07:48,503 --> 00:07:50,636
Fair enough.

145
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:54,900
This, my friends, is
the master bedroom !

146
00:07:54,936 --> 00:07:59,016
Check out the cathedral's ceilings,
those are like 17 feet high,

147
00:07:59,059 --> 00:08:01,602
we have cable readiness right there.

148
00:08:01,605 --> 00:08:03,572
I am going to totally
pimp this place out.

149
00:08:03,575 --> 00:08:06,162
I am going to put
a surround sound system,

150
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:09,083
I am going to put a plasma
screen right against this wall...

151
00:08:08,428 --> 00:08:09,881
owww terrible idea

152
00:08:09,326 --> 00:08:11,322
- I'm pulling my bed right over here
- No...

153
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:13,062
This is a shared wall,

154
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:14,793
Neighbor threw his wife into the wall,

155
00:08:14,798 --> 00:08:16,963
Plasma screen hits the floor,
totally smashed.

156
00:08:16,988 --> 00:08:19,300
- Well then I will get a warranty,
- Warranties don't cover it,

157
00:08:19,306 --> 00:08:19,982
plus they're a rip off.

158
00:08:19,997 --> 00:08:21,403
- Well I won't get a warranty,
- hush...

159
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:26,382
- There's the problem, it's solved.
- Listen, listen, can you hear that ?

160
00:08:28,088 --> 00:08:34,321
Oh man, these babies are thin !

161
00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:43,783
Games of the 1st
Dunder Mifflin Olympiad

162
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:46,472
This scented candle,

163
00:08:46,515 --> 00:08:49,631
which I found in the men's bathroom,

164
00:08:49,785 --> 00:08:53,211
represents the eternal...

165
00:08:53,795 --> 00:08:56,721
burning of competition...

166
00:08:56,947 --> 00:08:59,521
- or something.
- It smells like cookies.

167
00:08:59,607 --> 00:09:03,452
Yes it does, yes it does my friend.

168
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:08,633
Ok we will be competing for gold,
silver and bronze yogurt lids.

169
00:09:08,738 --> 00:09:10,791
Now the bronze are really blue,

170
00:09:10,798 --> 00:09:15,563
and they're also the backside of the
gold, so no flipping ok ? honor system.

171
00:09:19,908 --> 00:09:22,302
I do play games, I sing,

172
00:09:22,697 --> 00:09:25,040
and I dangle things in front of my cats.

173
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:28,130
I play lots of games, just not at work.

174
00:09:28,446 --> 00:09:30,510
Let the games begin !

175
00:09:36,346 --> 00:09:38,653
And then I just need you
to sign here at this ara

176
00:09:38,668 --> 00:09:42,510
- What kind of mortgage did you get ?
- 10 year.

177
00:09:42,768 --> 00:09:49,562
- Well, 10 over 30, so 30 year total.
- What ? wha... you said 10

178
00:09:50,398 --> 00:09:54,710
10 year fixed, over 30, 30 year total

179
00:09:54,775 --> 00:09:57,852
- Ow 30 years !
- Ok, ok.

180
00:09:58,067 --> 00:10:02,423
Wow you'll be paying this off
in your mid-seventies.

181
00:10:02,496 --> 00:10:04,990
Forget about retiring when you're 65

182
00:10:05,018 --> 00:10:06,090
Hey I have an idea,

183
00:10:06,095 --> 00:10:08,933
you know that extra bedroom, if the
all girlfriend thing never happens,

184
00:10:08,968 --> 00:10:12,202
- that's where the nurse can live.
- Ok, all right.

185
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:15,422
- Well this is it.
- Whenever you're ready.

186
00:10:15,477 --> 00:10:19,821
Yeah, huh, okay,

187
00:10:19,877 --> 00:10:22,883
- Is that supposed to come off ?
- Actually yeah.

188
00:10:21,065 --> 00:10:22,880
<i>Hey look cool ! carpenter ends.</i>

189
00:10:24,246 --> 00:10:27,720
I'm gonna take a little breather
for a second. Excuse me.

190
00:10:27,768 --> 00:10:30,662
- We'll be here waiting for you.
- Oh man !

191
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:32,771
A 30 year mortgage at Michael's age,

192
00:10:32,786 --> 00:10:35,060
essentially means
that he's buying a coffin.

193
00:10:35,287 --> 00:10:37,182
If I were buying my coffin,

194
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:42,061
I would get one with thicker walls,
so you couldn't hear other dead people.

195
00:10:45,288 --> 00:10:47,082
Whenever you're ready Michael !

196
00:10:48,886 --> 00:10:53,882
You have what is the national sport
of Icelandic paper companies,

197
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:57,413
and I'm blanking on the name...
could you help me out Pam ?

198
00:10:57,465 --> 00:11:02,043
Jim, they refer to it as Flonkerton,

199
00:11:02,088 --> 00:11:05,170
in English "box of papers
snowshoe racing."

200
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,312
Fair enough, but I like Flonkerton.

201
00:11:08,516 --> 00:11:11,230
The thing about Jim is,

202
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:14,370
when he's excited about something
like the office Olympics,

203
00:11:14,438 --> 00:11:18,712
he gets really into it and
he does a really great job,

204
00:11:18,735 --> 00:11:23,903
but the problem with Jim is that he
works here so that hardly ever happens.

205
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:28,630
So, who will be challenging Kevin
in flankerton ?

206
00:11:28,906 --> 00:11:30,582
- Anyone ?
- I'll do it.

207
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,881
Yes Phyllis.

208
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:39,731
Phyllis, you just put your foot right
trough here, right trough the flank.

209
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:43,992
The ceilings are lower than
they were last week, that, I don't,

210
00:11:44,168 --> 00:11:46,553
I don't know if you showed
me the same unit or not ?

211
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:45,742
What ?

212
00:11:46,598 --> 00:11:51,310
- Michael this is the unit you saw and...
- Where are all the hot people ?

213
00:11:51,338 --> 00:11:54,460
I was told that there would be
all these attractive singles,

214
00:11:54,497 --> 00:11:56,020
- Who told you that ?
- And as far as I can I tell,

215
00:11:56,026 --> 00:11:58,013
I'm the best looking person here.

216
00:11:58,077 --> 00:11:59,903
There's a basic principle,
in real estate,

217
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:03,320
that you should never be the best
looking person in the development.

218
00:12:03,396 --> 00:12:06,312
It's sort of a common sense,
because if you are,

219
00:12:06,357 --> 00:12:09,893
then you'll get no place to go but down.

220
00:12:10,198 --> 00:12:14,803
Is this a financial thing ? if it's
a financial thing what some people
do is they rent out the third bedroom.

221
00:12:14,856 --> 00:12:17,110
- No, no...
- That's an extra income for you...

222
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:19,101
I am not going to rent
the third bedroom,

223
00:12:19,108 --> 00:12:22,693
I want a price reduction
or I am walking.

224
00:12:23,057 --> 00:12:28,063
You will lose 7 000 $
if you walk away right now.

225
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:33,990
I made the right decision.
I'm glad I signed,

226
00:12:34,485 --> 00:12:36,633
I'm a home-owner, right ?

227
00:12:36,915 --> 00:12:40,233
Good to be a home-owner,
diversifying, this is good.

228
00:12:40,317 --> 00:12:43,583
- This is fun, we're having fun !
- Totally having fun !

229
00:12:43,657 --> 00:12:47,873
Can you imagine those poor saps
stuck at the office today ?

230
00:12:56,807 --> 00:12:57,700
It's Phyllis !

231
00:12:57,836 --> 00:13:00,810
Phyllis by a nose
gold-medal in flunenton,

232
00:13:00,827 --> 00:13:04,180
- flunkerton !
- Thank you ! Delegate from Iceland.

233
00:13:12,097 --> 00:13:16,613
Wow, ok no one else
should even try, gold medals.

234
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:18,920
Give  him medals !

235
00:13:19,586 --> 00:13:20,950
Wah !

236
00:13:22,937 --> 00:13:26,171
There's something else Dwight,
I want to talk to you about.

237
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:28,070
I have a surprise for you,

238
00:13:28,318 --> 00:13:30,360
- for helping me out today.
- Ow you don't have to d...

239
00:13:30,397 --> 00:13:32,330
No, no I insist, I insist,

240
00:13:32,338 --> 00:13:34,730
because you've really done
some great work, great work !

241
00:13:34,828 --> 00:13:39,580
And that is why I am going to let you
move in to my third bedroom,

242
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:41,482
and pay me rent.

243
00:13:43,418 --> 00:13:48,180
Why did I do it ? Because I believe
in rewarding people for their efforts,

244
00:13:48,867 --> 00:13:53,052
I rewarded Dwight with the room,

245
00:13:53,136 --> 00:13:58,403
and he is rewarding me back
with 500 $ plus utilities.

246
00:13:59,117 --> 00:14:00,620
I don't even know what to say...

247
00:14:00,647 --> 00:14:04,291
I'm thinking, lock into
a 4 year commitment,

248
00:14:04,317 --> 00:14:06,092
we'll go month to month after that,

249
00:14:06,265 --> 00:14:10,393
or until I start dating, have
a girlfriend and then you're...

250
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,941
you know, you're gone. So...

251
00:14:11,998 --> 00:14:15,232
Question :
where can I put my terrarium ?

252
00:14:17,005 --> 00:14:18,680
What the hell is a terrarium ?

253
00:14:18,687 --> 00:14:21,353
It's a fish tank for snakes and lizards.

254
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,270
Oh, so an aquarium.

255
00:14:25,075 --> 00:14:29,251
That will not come into this place ok ?

256
00:14:29,345 --> 00:14:30,801
- Question :
- Oh my god !

257
00:14:30,847 --> 00:14:34,872
my grandparents left me
a large number of armoires.

258
00:14:35,076 --> 00:14:37,552
- Are you sure you don't wanna play ?
- I'm sure.

259
00:14:37,565 --> 00:14:42,041
- Come on Angela don't you have a game ?
- I have one yes.

260
00:14:42,426 --> 00:14:45,670
- Well, let's play what is it ?
- I call it Pam-Pong,

261
00:14:45,697 --> 00:14:47,800
I count how many times
Jim gets up from his desk

262
00:14:47,835 --> 00:14:50,533
and goes to reception to talk to you.

263
00:14:50,836 --> 00:14:53,681
- We're friends.
- Apparently.

264
00:14:53,938 --> 00:14:57,862
<i>- Very nicely done. Ok so
I think that's a HOR for Stanley,</i>

265
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:01,101
- and HO for Phyllis.
- Are you calling me a ho ?

266
00:15:01,177 --> 00:15:04,983
Oh my god,
Phyllis coming alive, I like it.

267
00:15:05,098 --> 00:15:07,471
Question : what about carpooling ?

268
00:15:07,536 --> 00:15:09,733
- Who pays for the gas ?
- We take separate cars.

269
00:15:09,745 --> 00:15:11,701
and question can sometimes
I drive you car and you drive mine ?

270
00:15:11,716 --> 00:15:13,822
- Why would we do that ?
- Just for fun.

271
00:15:13,856 --> 00:15:14,483
No.

272
00:15:14,696 --> 00:15:16,470
Question : who's the primary
in the fire insurance ?

273
00:15:16,488 --> 00:15:18,821
HEP... GAME OVER !

274
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:22,253
Offer revoked Dwight.

275
00:15:22,386 --> 00:15:25,702
I'm sorry, but you reach out,
and you try to be a nice guy,

276
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,552
and help out a friend,
and this is what happens.

277
00:15:28,646 --> 00:15:30,540
This is what I get.

278
00:15:31,856 --> 00:15:34,150
God, I'm... ok.

279
00:15:35,915 --> 00:15:38,981
Thank god !
It was nice of him to offer,

280
00:15:39,347 --> 00:15:41,653
but I live in a nine bedroom farmhouse.

281
00:15:41,977 --> 00:15:45,573
I have my own crossbow range, 
it's a perfect situation for me.

282
00:15:46,036 --> 00:15:49,803
Well look 2 bathrooms would have
been nice, we just have but one.

283
00:15:50,805 --> 00:15:52,392
And it's under the porch.

284
00:15:55,115 --> 00:15:56,873
Who had someone from Vance Refrigeration

285
00:15:57,348 --> 00:16:02,533
Ryan Howard !
Ryan, gold medal.

286
00:16:02,627 --> 00:16:03,603
- What's up ?
- I made something,

287
00:16:03,616 --> 00:16:07,860
- For a closing ceremony.
- What ? Oh my god !

288
00:16:08,006 --> 00:16:11,192
- When did you have time to make that ?
- Automatic voice-mail.

289
00:16:11,407 --> 00:16:14,233
All right Pam, all right.

290
00:16:14,565 --> 00:16:16,631
Nice  work.

291
00:16:25,335 --> 00:16:28,131
You know you can always
refinance your mortgage.

292
00:16:28,165 --> 00:16:30,980
We had a 15 year on our beet farm,
we headed off early.

293
00:16:30,988 --> 00:16:34,320
Yeah, well you know what nobody
cares about your stupid beet farm.

294
00:16:34,608 --> 00:16:36,030
Beets are the worst !

295
00:16:36,135 --> 00:16:37,791
- People loved beets !
- Nobody likes beets.

296
00:16:37,806 --> 00:16:41,453
- Everyone loves beets.
- Nobody likes beets Dwight.

297
00:16:41,515 --> 00:16:44,263
Why don't you grow something
that everybody does like ?

298
00:16:44,446 --> 00:16:46,303
You should grow candy.

299
00:16:47,748 --> 00:16:50,450
I'd love a piece of candy right now,

300
00:16:50,896 --> 00:16:52,350
not a beet.

301
00:16:52,977 --> 00:16:55,320
- Let's get this roof com...
- Stop it !

302
00:16:55,426 --> 00:16:57,762
<i>Final lap, final lap.
 Oscar ! </i>

303
00:16:57,788 --> 00:17:01,450
Time to beat is 1'15,
time to beat is 1 minute 15 seconds !

304
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,351
Here they come !

305
00:17:08,806 --> 00:17:10,152
Guys ?

306
00:17:12,105 --> 00:17:14,051
- What is going on ?
- Nothing.

307
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:18,620
- Guys, time is still going, or...
- That's my stopwatch.

308
00:17:37,555 --> 00:17:39,500
There you go, all done.

309
00:17:39,536 --> 00:17:40,760
Great.

310
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:43,201
Yeah, I filled out
these expense reports.

311
00:17:43,297 --> 00:17:47,511
That take about 5 minutes and
then I close 2 sales at lunchtime.

312
00:17:48,217 --> 00:17:49,700
So...

313
00:17:49,997 --> 00:17:52,120
About as productive as any other day,

314
00:17:52,335 --> 00:17:54,140
if not more so...

315
00:18:01,335 --> 00:18:03,560
I figured I could throw it away now,

316
00:18:03,726 --> 00:18:08,422
or I could keep it, for a couple
of months and then throw it away.

317
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:11,023
I mean it was really nice at Pam
to make them, but...

318
00:18:11,035 --> 00:18:14,391
what am I gonna do with
a gold medal made of

319
00:18:14,765 --> 00:18:17,161
paperclips and an old yogurt lid ?

320
00:18:26,518 --> 00:18:29,750
- Hey !
- I have 59 voice mails.

321
00:18:30,508 --> 00:18:34,790
Hey can you ignore those and
do something for me instead ?

322
00:18:35,045 --> 00:18:37,382
- Sure.
- Ok.

323
00:18:37,478 --> 00:18:41,610
Today, at 5 o'clock, closing ceremonies.

324
00:18:42,266 --> 00:18:44,790
- Really ?
- Notify the athletes.

325
00:18:45,228 --> 00:18:45,933
Cool.

326
00:18:48,735 --> 00:18:52,023
- Michael ?
- Yep. Jim, slim Jim.

327
00:18:52,445 --> 00:18:54,331
What's going... what's going on ?

328
00:18:54,407 --> 00:18:57,491
Nothing I just want to
congratulate you on your condo.

329
00:18:57,557 --> 00:19:00,111
Oh thanks, thanks very cool,

330
00:19:00,156 --> 00:19:02,970
- it's a 3 bedroom gay-friendly,
- Nice,

331
00:19:03,286 --> 00:19:03,961
You know...

332
00:19:03,998 --> 00:19:06,210
Hey would you mind
coming out here for a second ?

333
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:08,503
- I have something for you.
- Really ?

334
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:12,541
What's this ?

335
00:19:12,687 --> 00:19:16,100
These are the closing ceremonies,
step up !

336
00:19:18,397 --> 00:19:20,840
Here on the top one.

337
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:25,150
Congratulations to Michael,
because he closed on his condo,

338
00:19:25,326 --> 00:19:26,712
so gold medal !

339
00:19:32,595 --> 00:19:37,741
I don't really know what to say,

340
00:19:39,548 --> 00:19:42,613
I'm not one for making speeches, but...

341
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,133
My heart is very full at this moment.

342
00:19:49,127 --> 00:19:52,061
And for Dwight Schrute the silver medal.

343
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:56,112
Get on up here Dwight !

344
00:20:01,457 --> 00:20:05,613
- Silver medal.
- Yep, but not as good as gold !

345
00:20:11,387 --> 00:20:13,753
Why are you playing
the national hymn ?

346
00:20:14,688 --> 00:20:18,592
- Cause your condo is in America.
- Oh.

347
00:20:24,165 --> 00:20:29,490
- What the hell is that ?
- Those are the doves.

00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,714
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.

2
00:00:08,198 --> 00:00:10,262
Sure, can I ask who's calling ?

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,375
Just a second.

4
00:00:16,069 --> 00:00:17,254
Jim Halpert

5
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,069
What ?
How did you get this number ?

6
00:00:19,795 --> 00:00:20,846
Stalker.

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,120
Katy, and Jim, met in the office.

8
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:25,145
And now I guess they're like,

9
00:00:25,221 --> 00:00:27,477
going out, or dating, or something.

10
00:00:27,688 --> 00:00:29,380
And, uh...

11
00:00:30,723 --> 00:00:32,766
I don't know ! You know, they're just,

12
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:35,020
she calls him, and they...

13
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:37,466
You know, I'm sorry, I feel like
I'm talking really loud.

14
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:38,860
Am I talking really loud ?

15
00:00:38,968 --> 00:00:40,921
So we're still on for lunch ?
You're meeting me here ?

16
00:00:41,256 --> 00:00:42,393
Okay.

17
00:00:42,647 --> 00:00:44,082
Great. Bye.

18
00:00:46,715 --> 00:00:47,533
Hey.

19
00:00:47,698 --> 00:00:49,543
You can just give her your extension.

20
00:00:49,797 --> 00:00:51,283
Okay.

21
00:01:23,078 --> 00:01:24,981

http://pmag.f2o.org/theofficeus/

22
00:01:25,405 --> 00:01:27,162
Howard, slash Ryan.

23
00:01:27,255 --> 00:01:29,610
Ryan Howard is sitting in my office,

24
00:01:29,796 --> 00:01:32,061
and he has been a temp
here for a couple of months

25
00:01:32,185 --> 00:01:36,211
and he's kind of gotten,
a lay of the land, a little bit.

26
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:39,323
Had a few laughs along the way,
and now he wants to know,

27
00:01:39,495 --> 00:01:41,320
what I think.

28
00:01:41,506 --> 00:01:44,452
The temp agency wants
to know what you think.

29
00:01:44,998 --> 00:01:47,441
Shall we ? Let us proceed

30
00:01:47,686 --> 00:01:51,112
First up, proficiency
in necessary skills

31
00:01:52,395 --> 00:01:56,342
Aaaaaaa-eeeeexcellent !

32
00:02:01,657 --> 00:02:04,882
Michael's in there right
now evaluating the temp.

33
00:02:05,177 --> 00:02:07,890
He hasn't evaluated me in years.

34
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:10,673
Five years from now, what do you
want to do? Where you wanna be ?

35
00:02:10,826 --> 00:02:13,152
Ah, well, I'm interested in business.

36
00:02:13,306 --> 00:02:16,102
Oh. Good, ambitious. Excellent.

37
00:02:16,828 --> 00:02:19,033
- Want to be a manager ?
- Uh, no,

38
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:21,662
Actually, ah, what I want is
to own my own company.

39
00:02:21,848 --> 00:02:24,492
That is ridiculous.

40
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:28,430
Ryan's about to attend the
Michael Scott school of business.

41
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:32,830
I'm like Mr. Miyagi and
Yoda rolled into one.

42
00:02:32,965 --> 00:02:35,780
Much advice you seek.

43
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:39,113
Do you know who that is ?

44
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:41,833
Fozzie bear ?

45
00:02:43,265 --> 00:02:47,521
Mm, no. That was Yoda.

46
00:02:47,718 --> 00:02:51,290
There are ten rules in
business that you need to learn.

47
00:02:52,015 --> 00:02:53,872
Number one.

48
00:02:54,846 --> 00:02:57,393
You need to play to win.

49
00:02:57,475 --> 00:02:59,012
But,

50
00:02:59,107 --> 00:03:00,511
you also,

51
00:03:00,595 --> 00:03:03,373
have to win, to play.

52
00:03:05,696 --> 00:03:06,461
Got it.

53
00:03:06,547 --> 00:03:10,323
And I will give you
the rest of the, ten at lunch.

54
00:03:14,075 --> 00:03:15,670
Hey.

55
00:03:20,136 --> 00:03:22,480
Michael and I have a
very special connection.

56
00:03:22,526 --> 00:03:24,273
He's like Batman, I'm like Robin.

57
00:03:24,326 --> 00:03:26,902
He's like the Lone Ranger,
and I'm like Tonto.

58
00:03:27,038 --> 00:03:31,020
And it's not like there was the
Lone Ranger, and Tonto, and Bonto.

59
00:03:42,275 --> 00:03:43,002
People !

60
00:03:43,045 --> 00:03:44,400
Okay, everybody...

61
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:46,451
This is not a test ! Move to the exits !

62
00:03:46,485 --> 00:03:48,282
- Devon, head towards the exits.
- Do not panic.

63
00:03:48,338 --> 00:03:49,830
- Safety partners-
- Get up off your desks !

64
00:03:49,865 --> 00:03:50,861
Do not panic.

65
00:03:50,917 --> 00:03:53,901
- No, panic is warranted !
This is not at drill !
- Go in a single file line.

66
00:03:54,007 --> 00:03:56,532
- Arms at your sides, arms at your sides.
- Please, move quickly !

67
00:03:56,578 --> 00:03:58,652
This is a paper company people...

68
00:03:58,837 --> 00:04:00,582
- ...Step lively!
- Go, let's go.

69
00:04:00,635 --> 00:04:03,250
This whole place is a tinder box,
it is ready to blow !

70
00:04:06,185 --> 00:04:07,840
This is not a test!
Can you leave?!

71
00:04:07,885 --> 00:04:09,101
Oh, you say that every time.

72
00:04:09,136 --> 00:04:10,720
DO YOU WANT TO DIE !?

73
00:04:10,748 --> 00:04:12,870
- Oh, boy...
- Do you want to die !?

74
00:04:12,905 --> 00:04:13,871
-  OUT !!
- Alright, let's go, let's go.

75
00:04:13,915 --> 00:04:16,013
STANLEY ! Have you ever
seen a burn victim! ?

76
00:04:16,085 --> 00:04:17,541
- Come on, you're safety partners !
- Move to the exits !

77
00:04:17,637 --> 00:04:18,650
You're safety partners!

78
00:04:18,696 --> 00:04:21,361
We've got smoke !
We've got smoke! SMOKE !

79
00:04:36,967 --> 00:04:38,901
Oh! Kelly! Are you okay ?
Don't worry, I got you !

80
00:04:38,936 --> 00:04:40,571
- I'm okay!
- Cover your nose and face.

81
00:04:40,695 --> 00:04:42,211
- Breathe through your nose.
- Let go of me !

82
00:04:43,187 --> 00:04:45,332
Remove your stockings. Okay?

83
00:04:45,395 --> 00:04:46,670
They'll melt right into your flesh !

84
00:04:46,785 --> 00:04:48,632
Stay below the smoke line.

85
00:04:49,525 --> 00:04:52,553
Let's go! Clear out, stat !

86
00:04:52,638 --> 00:04:54,552
STAT MEANS NOW !

87
00:04:57,226 --> 00:04:59,373
Yes, I was the first one out,

88
00:04:59,487 --> 00:05:02,262
and yes, I've heard
women and children first.

89
00:05:02,356 --> 00:05:04,630
But, we do not employ children.

90
00:05:04,678 --> 00:05:07,430
We are not a sweat shop. Thankfully.

91
00:05:07,695 --> 00:05:12,681
And, uh, women are equal,
in the workplace, by law.

92
00:05:13,286 --> 00:05:17,492
So, I let them out first,
I have a lawsuit on my hands.

93
00:05:18,328 --> 00:05:22,533
Another rule of business is being
able to adapt to different situations.

94
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:23,683
Yeah.

95
00:05:23,758 --> 00:05:27,582
Adapt. React. Re-adapt.

96
00:05:27,877 --> 00:05:30,673
Act. Alright ? That's rule number two.

97
00:05:30,767 --> 00:05:32,981
Okay, guys, listen up,
we need a head count.

98
00:05:33,075 --> 00:05:35,540
We need to count off. Michael's
number one. Where's, where is he?

99
00:05:35,606 --> 00:05:36,933
So what was rule number two?

100
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:38,811
Ah, adapt, react, re-adapt, act.

101
00:05:38,846 --> 00:05:41,731
Okay, well, let's just kind
of take it a little slower.

102
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,782
Oh, hey, Michael. Ryan needs
a number for the count off.

103
00:05:43,836 --> 00:05:46,340
Okay, well, one is taken.

104
00:05:46,676 --> 00:05:47,701
Okay, two ?

105
00:05:47,786 --> 00:05:49,510
- NO !
- Ok. Oh, sorry ?

106
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,500
Okay, he can have 14,
Margerie isn't here today.

107
00:05:51,577 --> 00:05:53,293
Well, he needs a
permanent number, right ?

108
00:05:53,357 --> 00:05:54,321
No, I don't.

109
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,843
Oh, you know what else, I thought
of a nickname for the three of us.

110
00:05:56,996 --> 00:05:58,343
The  Three Musketeers.

111
00:05:58,415 --> 00:06:00,480
Um, yeah, okay.

112
00:06:00,595 --> 00:06:03,311
Oh, no, no, no, no. I got one.
I got one. The Three Stooges.

113
00:06:03,348 --> 00:06:05,731
That's funny too.
But if we're the Three Musketeers...

114
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:08,441
I don't want to be like, a guy here.

115
00:06:08,525 --> 00:06:09,492
You know ?

116
00:06:09,597 --> 00:06:12,651
Like, Stanley is the
crossword puzzle guy.

117
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:17,412
And Angela has cats.
I don't wanna have a thing, here.

118
00:06:18,205 --> 00:06:21,860
You know, I don't want to be,
the something guy.

119
00:06:22,706 --> 00:06:24,183
Okay, you know what?

120
00:06:24,245 --> 00:06:26,462
I think I'm going to be,
setting the agenda here.

121
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,701
Okay? Can everybody gather up please?

122
00:06:28,816 --> 00:06:30,941
Important announcement,
very important announcement.

123
00:06:31,175 --> 00:06:33,921
I think this is a perfect
opportunity for all of us

124
00:06:33,975 --> 00:06:37,023
to participate in some really intense,

125
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:39,603
psychologically revealing conversations.

126
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:41,752
So we're going to 
be playing, desert island.

127
00:06:43,168 --> 00:06:45,091
Who would you do ?

128
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:46,253
And, um...

129
00:06:46,286 --> 00:06:47,972
- ...would you rather ?
- Would you rather.

130
00:06:48,068 --> 00:06:50,513
Would you rather? Is our third game.

131
00:07:01,867 --> 00:07:04,520
Hey guys, great response time.

132
00:07:04,626 --> 00:07:08,101
Listen up, I got some
theories, there's a...

133
00:07:08,597 --> 00:07:12,971
Okay, so, three books
on a desert island...Angela.

134
00:07:13,185 --> 00:07:14,852
The Bible.

135
00:07:17,058 --> 00:07:20,182
That's one book, you got two others.

136
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:21,860
A  Purpose Driven Life.

137
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:22,770
Nice.

138
00:07:24,247 --> 00:07:25,882
- Third book.
- No.

139
00:07:27,105 --> 00:07:28,232
Okay. Phyllis.

140
00:07:28,288 --> 00:07:29,773
Um, The DaVinci Code.

141
00:07:29,818 --> 00:07:32,633
The DaVinci Code. I would
take The DaVinci Code,

142
00:07:32,748 --> 00:07:34,240
so I could burn The DaVinci Code.

143
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,360
Okay great, that is going to
keep you warm for like 7 seconds.

144
00:07:37,653 --> 00:07:40,566
Question, is there fire
wood on the island ?

145
00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:41,470
I guess.

146
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:43,626
Then I would bring an axe, no books.

147
00:07:43,739 --> 00:07:45,770
Uh, it has to be a book Dwight.

148
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:48,703
Fine. Physician's Desk Reference.

149
00:07:48,818 --> 00:07:49,700
Nice, smart.

150
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:54,070
Hallowed out, inside, waterproof
matches, iodine tablets,

151
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:58,171
beet seeds, protein bars, NASA blanket,

152
00:07:58,267 --> 00:08:03,160
and, in case I get bored,
Harry Potter and Sorcerer's Stone.

153
00:08:03,288 --> 00:08:05,550
No, Harry Potter and
the Prisoner of Azkaban.

154
00:08:05,648 --> 00:08:08,633
Question, did my shoes come off
in the plane crash ?

155
00:08:08,807 --> 00:08:14,771
Rule number four. In business,
image is everything, Andre Augessi.

156
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,892
This car is an investment.

157
00:08:16,976 --> 00:08:21,690
Right ? If I have to take out a client,
or I'm seen around Scranton in it.

158
00:08:24,377 --> 00:08:26,932
I love it, I love this car.

159
00:08:29,168 --> 00:08:31,341
Do you like it ?

160
00:08:33,037 --> 00:08:34,140
Yeah.

161
00:08:34,196 --> 00:08:36,532
Okay, I thought people read more books.

162
00:08:36,596 --> 00:08:39,463
DVDs! Five movies.
What would you bring to the island?

163
00:08:39,526 --> 00:08:40,581
Yes, Meredith.

164
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,243
Legends of the Fall,
My Big Fat Greek Wedding,

165
00:08:43,277 --> 00:08:46,120
Legally Blond, Bridges
of Madison County...

166
00:08:46,217 --> 00:08:47,392
Wow.

167
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:48,920
Legends of the Fall.

168
00:08:49,035 --> 00:08:52,272
Wow. Bridges of Madison County,
Legally Blond, these movies are just-

169
00:08:52,287 --> 00:08:54,662
- Well, I kind of like Legally...
- Wait, wait, wait.

170
00:08:54,776 --> 00:08:57,002
Pam, no. Do you understand ?

171
00:08:57,058 --> 00:09:01,581
The, the game is desert island movies,
not guilty pleasure movies.

172
00:09:01,645 --> 00:09:03,672
Desert island movies are the
movies you are going to watch,

173
00:09:03,797 --> 00:09:05,362
for the rest of your life.

174
00:09:05,566 --> 00:09:07,921
Forever ! Unforgivable.

175
00:09:07,976 --> 00:09:09,441
- I take it back.
- Unforgivable.

176
00:09:09,457 --> 00:09:11,223
- I take it back !
- Good.

177
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:14,850
And Ghost.
But, just that one scene...

178
00:09:18,477 --> 00:09:19,441
Is this your car Ryan ?

179
00:09:19,498 --> 00:09:21,460
Wow, those are some pretty
big books back there, huh ?

180
00:09:21,498 --> 00:09:24,082
- Good shocks.
- Hello, Mr. Egghead

181
00:09:24,266 --> 00:09:27,403
So...oh, Stanley Kaplan, I know him.

182
00:09:27,598 --> 00:09:29,903
'M' is for murder, 'P' is for...

183
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,731
- That's actually a test prep book.
- For phone. What ?

184
00:09:31,836 --> 00:09:33,393
That's a test prep, for business school?

185
00:09:33,945 --> 00:09:35,230
Oh, thinking about business school ?

186
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:37,320
I just got in. I applied, I go at night.

187
00:09:37,407 --> 00:09:38,191
- Really ?
- Yeah.

188
00:09:38,236 --> 00:09:40,260
So you think you know
a lot about business ?

189
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:41,462
No, not yet.

190
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:43,451
- Just started.
- Uh huh. Yeah.

191
00:09:43,596 --> 00:09:44,823
Quiz me.

192
00:09:44,997 --> 00:09:46,603
- I wouldn't even know where to start.
- Oh, come on.

193
00:09:46,657 --> 00:09:48,260
Come on, egghead. Let's do it.

194
00:09:48,325 --> 00:09:50,012
- Do it.
- Quiz me up.

195
00:09:50,146 --> 00:09:52,280
Alright, um,

196
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:56,572
why have people been rethinking the
Microsoft model in the past few years ?

197
00:10:01,585 --> 00:10:05,252
When I was Ryan's age, I worked
in a fast food restaurant,

198
00:10:05,286 --> 00:10:06,953
to save up money for school.

199
00:10:07,157 --> 00:10:11,051
And I, then I, lost it in a pyramid scheme,

200
00:10:11,095 --> 00:10:13,661
but I learned more about business,

201
00:10:14,145 --> 00:10:17,010
right then and there, than business
school would ever teach me,

202
00:10:17,036 --> 00:10:18,752
or Ryan would ever teach me.

203
00:10:18,816 --> 00:10:23,383
Is it cheaper to sign a new customer ?
Or to keep an existing customer ?

204
00:10:23,565 --> 00:10:25,492
- Keep an existing cus-
- Shut, it.

205
00:10:25,637 --> 00:10:29,383
Can I, can I just do it please ?
Ah, it's equal.

206
00:10:30,288 --> 00:10:32,781
It is ten times more expensive
to sign a new customer.

207
00:10:32,837 --> 00:10:34,663
Okay, yes, it was a trick question.

208
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:36,682
He, but, look, okay,
he didn't need business school.

209
00:10:36,776 --> 00:10:38,821
Okay, Michael, he,
comes from the school of hard knocks.

210
00:10:38,885 --> 00:10:39,423
- Self taught.

211
00:10:39,475 --> 00:10:40,692
- You didn't even go to college
- You know what,

212
00:10:40,798 --> 00:10:42,930
you don't need to help me here. Okay ?

213
00:10:42,997 --> 00:10:45,771
Well, you know, maybe you should
go to business school like Ryan,

214
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:47,721
then, then you'd know
what you were talking about.

215
00:10:47,755 --> 00:10:48,791
Come on.

216
00:10:48,868 --> 00:10:51,083
- I studying with the master, huh ?
- Why don't you go to business

217
00:10:51,165 --> 00:10:52,712
Why don't you learn from him, right ?

218
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:54,021
Stop it. Dwight.

219
00:10:54,096 --> 00:10:56,610
You know what, you're
acting like a dork.

220
00:10:56,738 --> 00:10:58,172
Would you cool it ? Please.

221
00:10:58,286 --> 00:11:02,753
Hey, hey ! He's not
your five year old brother, Dwight.

222
00:11:02,846 --> 00:11:05,280
He's a valued member of this company,

223
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:09,111
and you know what, he's knows more
about business than you ever will.

224
00:11:12,155 --> 00:11:13,363
Stupid.

225
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:14,930
I did not go to business school.

226
00:11:14,988 --> 00:11:16,410
You know who else didn't
go to business school ?

227
00:11:16,498 --> 00:11:19,680
Labron James, Tracey McGrady,
Kobe Bryant.

228
00:11:20,425 --> 00:11:23,783
They right from high
school to the NBA. So...

229
00:11:26,448 --> 00:11:29,380
so it's not the same thing, at all.

230
00:11:30,158 --> 00:11:31,471
Look at this stuff.

231
00:11:31,535 --> 00:11:34,090
Market fragments,
what is that suppose to be ?

232
00:11:34,156 --> 00:11:37,752
It's a way of looking at consumers
as subsets of a larger client base.

233
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:42,742
You are so smart.
You are so eff-ing smart.

234
00:11:42,855 --> 00:11:44,652
You  should be teaching me.

235
00:11:46,365 --> 00:11:48,341
Pam, get us back into it.

236
00:11:48,435 --> 00:11:51,562
- Five movies, go ahead.
- Okay, um, Fargo,

237
00:11:51,788 --> 00:11:54,561
um, Edward Scissorhands,
Dazed and Confused...

238
00:11:54,597 --> 00:11:55,902
Oh, definitely in my top five.

239
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,332
Yes, in my top three, so suck it.

240
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,432
Breakfast Club. Um,

241
00:12:01,678 --> 00:12:03,220
- The Princess Bride and-
- Okay that's five.

242
00:12:03,288 --> 00:12:04,433
No, my all time favorite !

243
00:12:04,488 --> 00:12:06,872
- Pam, play by the rules.
Play by the rules.
- All, time, favorite.

244
00:12:08,455 --> 00:12:10,033
Dwight.

245
00:12:10,456 --> 00:12:12,802
All time favorite movie.

246
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:17,552
The Crow.

247
00:12:19,018 --> 00:12:21,372
I became a sales man.

248
00:12:22,357 --> 00:12:25,431
Because of people,
I love making friends.

249
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:30,430
But then I was promoted to manager,
very young age.

250
00:12:31,356 --> 00:12:34,182
I still try to be a friend first, but,

251
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,620
you know ?

252
00:12:36,717 --> 00:12:41,250
I'm very successful, your coworkers
look at you differently...

253
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:48,483
what do you think ?

254
00:12:49,917 --> 00:12:51,853
Maybe we should get some air.

255
00:12:52,088 --> 00:12:53,682
Nah, I'm okay.

256
00:12:55,747 --> 00:12:57,773
I'm really uncomfortable.

257
00:12:59,456 --> 00:13:01,500
Alright, let's move on.

258
00:13:01,676 --> 00:13:04,183
Let's move on to the main event,
who would you do ?

259
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:07,303
- Present company excluded ?
- Um, not neccessaril

260
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,691
Pam.

261
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:14,553
Okay. Ah, you know what ? Maybe I'll,
I'll finish explaining the rules,

262
00:13:14,845 --> 00:13:16,823
let's, let me explain it first,
and then...

263
00:13:20,886 --> 00:13:23,280
Yeah, so we'll get right, you know what?
I'll be right back.

264
00:13:23,728 --> 00:13:26,480
Stanley, you're taking over
for me buddy. I'll be right back

265
00:13:26,756 --> 00:13:29,172
Okay, um...

266
00:13:31,398 --> 00:13:34,320
Dwight. Dwight.

267
00:13:35,136 --> 00:13:37,811
Come on buddy, use words.

268
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:41,533
Why didn't I go to business school ?

269
00:13:41,758 --> 00:13:43,442
- Who goes to business school ?
- The temp.

270
00:13:43,596 --> 00:13:46,122
Yeah, it's all him and Michael
talk about anymore.

271
00:13:46,347 --> 00:13:49,463
You know, I bet Ryan thinks to himself,

272
00:13:49,678 --> 00:13:52,531
I wish I were a volunteer
sheriff on the weekends

273
00:13:52,817 --> 00:13:55,272
- He doesn't even know that I do that.
- You should tell him.

274
00:13:55,787 --> 00:13:57,941
Oh yeah Pam, right.

275
00:13:58,056 --> 00:14:00,613
That's going to help things,
just talk it out.

276
00:14:00,768 --> 00:14:03,333
I hope the war goes on
forever and Ryan gets drafted.

277
00:14:03,447 --> 00:14:04,510
- Dwight...
- What ?

278
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:08,523
I'm sorry I said that, I didn't...
Just part of me meant it.

279
00:14:09,147 --> 00:14:12,963
Besides, he'd end up being
a hero anyway.

280
00:14:13,298 --> 00:14:17,470
You know what you should do ?
You should quit.

281
00:14:17,827 --> 00:14:21,013
And then, that would 
stick it to both of them.

282
00:14:21,706 --> 00:14:24,171
Jim, I'm not going to quit.

283
00:14:24,506 --> 00:14:27,603
- Then Ryan wins.
- Yeah, you're right.

284
00:14:27,737 --> 00:14:31,610
Thanks you guy
I just need some alone time.

285
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:32,983
Okay.

286
00:14:33,276 --> 00:14:35,072
Alright buddy.

287
00:14:39,636 --> 00:14:42,603
- Hey you guys, what's going on ?
- Nothing

288
00:14:42,638 --> 00:14:44,522
- Hey.
- What's up ?

289
00:14:44,607 --> 00:14:46,271
Can I hang out with you guys for a bit ?

290
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,822
The  warehouse guys are a
bunch of jackasses sometimes.

291
00:14:49,015 --> 00:14:51,140
Come on, people, you know
the rules of the game now

292
00:14:51,316 --> 00:14:53,862

00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,890
I play this at home all the time,
while I'm falling asleep.

295
00:15:01,696 --> 00:15:03,191
What, ah, where are we ?

296
00:15:03,258 --> 00:15:04,272
Where are we here ?

297
00:15:05,027 --> 00:15:06,401
Roy ? Roy ?

298
00:15:06,978 --> 00:15:08,473
Who would you do Roy ?

299
00:15:09,718 --> 00:15:12,072
I got it, uh, what's the
name of that uh,

300
00:15:12,947 --> 00:15:15,290
tight ass, Christian, chick
the blond ?

301
00:15:15,558 --> 00:15:17,192
My name is Angela.

302
00:15:17,358 --> 00:15:18,732
Hey, Angela, Roy.

303
00:15:18,788 --> 00:15:19,882
Nice to meet you.

304
00:15:19,997 --> 00:15:22,203
Aaaalright, who's next, who's next,
who's next, who's next ?

305
00:15:22,277 --> 00:15:24,100
Jim ? You're next.

306
00:15:24,218 --> 00:15:25,472
Who would you do ?

307
00:15:27,715 --> 00:15:28,980
Kevin, hands down.

308
00:15:30,115 --> 00:15:30,962
Yeah

309
00:15:31,328 --> 00:15:33,521
He's really got that teddy
bear thing going on,

310
00:15:33,888 --> 00:15:36,240
and afterwards, we could
just watch bowling.

311
00:15:37,828 --> 00:15:41,463
Well, I would definitely
have sex with Ryan.

312
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:45,542
Cause he is going
to own his own business.

313
00:15:46,617 --> 00:15:47,961
You're all gay.

314
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:50,711
Who's, ah, who's next ? Who we got ?

315
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:52,622
Who...

316
00:15:52,688 --> 00:15:55,021
Hey, no, I can talk,
I can talk, I can talk...

317
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:55,753
That is great timing

318
00:15:55,887 --> 00:15:58,321
Wish I had my cell phone,
but I left it inside. So...

319
00:15:58,385 --> 00:15:59,962
- Would that make you happy ?
- What that ?

320
00:16:00,056 --> 00:16:01,543
If you had your cell phone,
it would make you happy ?

321
00:16:01,645 --> 00:16:02,633
- Yeah.
- I'm on it.

322
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:03,883
Dwight. Hey !

323
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,431
- You can't go back in yet !
- Dwight don't !

324
00:16:05,905 --> 00:16:07,101
He is an idiot.

325
00:16:07,238 --> 00:16:09,033
The man is an idiot
ladies and gentlemen.

326
00:16:09,298 --> 00:16:11,322
What if he dies in the fire ?

327
00:16:11,736 --> 00:16:14,472
And that's the last thing
you ever said to him.

328
00:16:14,545 --> 00:16:16,992
I didn't say it to him.
I said it about him.

329
00:16:21,475 --> 00:16:23,111
- Jim
- Definitely Jim.

330
00:16:23,305 --> 00:16:24,713
Definitely, definitely, Jim.

331
00:16:24,957 --> 00:16:26,790
Come on, Pam. Come on, Pam.

332
00:16:28,685 --> 00:16:29,763
Oscar's kind of cute.

333
00:16:29,836 --> 00:16:31,563
Yeah, I like Oscar.

334
00:16:31,846 --> 00:16:33,252
Ooh, Toby.

335
00:16:33,846 --> 00:16:37,460
How long does it take
to find a cell phone ?

336
00:16:40,395 --> 00:16:42,601
I don't know, is there anybody else.

337
00:16:45,627 --> 00:16:47,082
Hey, where are you ?

338
00:16:48,218 --> 00:16:49,553
Oh good.

339
00:16:49,868 --> 00:16:51,963
Yeah, we're just here,
we're playing desert island.

340
00:16:52,116 --> 00:16:53,881
It's when you pick
your five favorite DVDs...

341
00:16:53,995 --> 00:16:55,961
Seriously, where the hell is Dwight ?

342
00:17:00,195 --> 00:17:01,503
Hey,

343
00:17:02,305 --> 00:17:03,743
Call my cell phone,

344
00:17:03,858 --> 00:17:05,770
It'll make it easier for him to find.

345
00:17:07,775 --> 00:17:09,243
What's your number ?

346
00:17:09,316 --> 00:17:10,971
I gave it to you in the car.

347
00:17:12,857 --> 00:17:14,541
I saw you program it in.

348
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:16,581
You got to...

349
00:17:16,805 --> 00:17:18,523
- You got to give it to me again.
- Okay, alright.

350
00:17:22,537 --> 00:17:24,283
Now I have it.

351
00:17:36,957 --> 00:17:38,582
I better tell somebody.

352
00:17:38,865 --> 00:17:40,190
Excuse me sir...

353
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:42,371
Dwight !?

354
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:44,553
Great God man.

355
00:17:44,645 --> 00:17:46,712
Why did you, why did you go in there ?

356
00:17:46,785 --> 00:17:48,692
What did you, everybody was
scared out of their wits okay ?

357
00:17:48,746 --> 00:17:51,321
Everyone, okay, I have an announcement.

358
00:17:52,617 --> 00:17:55,371
Apparently, in business school, 

359
00:17:55,637 --> 00:17:58,383
they don't teach you how
to operate a toaster oven.

360
00:17:59,335 --> 00:18:01,623
Because some smart, sexy,

361
00:18:01,735 --> 00:18:06,470
left his cheese pita on oven instead
of timing it for the toaster thing.

362
00:18:08,985 --> 00:18:11,350
Wow. Okay.

363
00:18:11,845 --> 00:18:13,133
Well, I guess they don't,

364
00:18:13,278 --> 00:18:16,400
how to operate a toaster
oven in business school.

365
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,581
That's exactly what I said.

366
00:18:17,637 --> 00:18:19,803
Hey,  did you miss that day there Ryan ?

367
00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:22,110
- Were you absent ?
- Toaster oven 101 ?

368
00:18:22,196 --> 00:18:24,021
- You failed?
- I am so sorry.

369
00:18:26,418 --> 00:18:28,750
Hey, I know what'll impress everybody,

370
00:18:28,928 --> 00:18:30,182
I'll start a fire.

371
00:18:30,945 --> 00:18:33,092
Oh, man. Bad idea.

372
00:18:33,275 --> 00:18:35,152
Bad idea genes.

373
00:18:35,308 --> 00:18:38,241
I have a song, attention everyone,
that I want sing.

374
00:18:38,406 --> 00:18:41,740
That I wrote specially for this occasion
when I was up there among the flames.

375
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:43,880
Ready ?

376
00:18:43,965 --> 00:18:45,900
<i>RYAN STARTED THE FI-AH!</i>

377
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:49,631
<i>IT WAS ALWAYS BURNING
SINCE THE WORLD WAS TURNING !</i>

378
00:18:49,767 --> 00:18:52,333
<i>RYAN STARTED THE FI-AH! </i>

379
00:18:52,576 --> 00:18:53,993
<i>IT WAS ALWAYS BURNING</i>

380
00:18:54,138 --> 00:18:55,903
- <i>SINCE THE WORLD WAS TURNING</i>.
- Everybody !

381
00:18:56,955 --> 00:18:59,982
I can't believe, I started, the fire.

382
00:19:01,117 --> 00:19:03,553
<i>RYAN STARTED THE FIRE!</i>

383
00:19:04,295 --> 00:19:06,163

385
00:19:10,146 --> 00:19:12,323
Now eat it, you have to eat it.

00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,052
- Hey !
- Hey.

387
00:19:14,475 --> 00:19:15,071
How are you ?

388
00:19:15,146 --> 00:19:17,133
- I'm great, good to see you.
- It's good to see you too.

389
00:19:17,347 --> 00:19:18,851
I'm hungry.
Yeah, I am too.

390
00:19:19,385 --> 00:19:21,712
I have been thinking the whole way over.

391
00:19:22,196 --> 00:19:24,352
And I have my answers.
What answers ?

392
00:19:24,406 --> 00:19:25,801
For the, the desert island...

393
00:19:25,885 --> 00:19:27,881
Oh! Right! Right, right,
right, right, come on

394
00:19:27,947 --> 00:19:30,412
Ladies and gentlemen, gather around,
we have one more participant,

395
00:19:30,478 --> 00:19:32,241
Come on, be polite. Be polite.

396
00:19:32,596 --> 00:19:34,602
Desert island, five movies, go.

397
00:19:35,377 --> 00:19:36,551
Okay

398
00:19:37,268 --> 00:19:38,543
First,

399
00:19:39,198 --> 00:19:41,040
legally Blond.

400
00:19:42,355 --> 00:19:45,632
I forgot what a super,
nice, girl Katy is

401
00:19:46,576 --> 00:19:48,041
And just, good for Jim.

402
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,262
They are so cute together.

403
00:19:50,328 --> 00:19:52,742
And, what an adorable car.

404
00:19:54,355 --> 00:19:55,880
Okay.

405
00:19:56,026 --> 00:19:58,270
I think the game's over,
people are like leaving

406
00:19:58,338 --> 00:20:00,833
there was a bigger crowd last time.
Do you just want to go to lunch ?

407
00:20:00,965 --> 00:20:01,733
- Okay.
- Yeah ?

408
00:20:01,915 --> 00:20:03,401
Alright, you want to drive ?

00:20:11,935 --> 00:20:13,431
They are so cute.

410
00:20:14,976 --> 00:20:16,262
I'm really sorry Dwight.

411
00:20:16,337 --> 00:20:17,773
- Answer me this though.
- What ?

412
00:20:17,905 --> 00:20:19,322
Was it worth it ?

413
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:20,732
- Was it worth it temp ?
- No.

414
00:20:20,765 --> 00:20:21,630
- Was it worth it ?
- Really ?

415
00:20:21,716 --> 00:20:22,831
I'm really sorry Dwight.

416
00:20:23,047 --> 00:20:25,212
The fire guy ! The fire guy !

<i>Television, North Korea,
South Korea, Marilyn Monroe,</i>

00:20:30,548 --> 00:20:32,600
<i>RYAN STARTED THE FIRE!</i>

420
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,301
Okay, rule five, safety first.

421
00:20:35,425 --> 00:20:37,771
I.e, don't burn the building down.

422
00:20:37,897 --> 00:20:40,392
Okay ? That should be a no brainer.

423
00:20:40,535 --> 00:20:42,091
Oh, look !

424
00:20:42,176 --> 00:20:44,813
Ryan, is book smart.

425
00:20:45,596 --> 00:20:47,550
And I am street smart.

426
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:49,281
And book smart.

427
00:20:49,885 --> 00:20:53,883

00:00:09,222 --> 00:00:10,512
Happy Halloween, everyone.

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:11,920
Oh, that's great.

3
00:00:11,984 --> 00:00:14,155
Hey. Happy Halloween.

4
00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:17,552
Jan called.

5
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:20,234
Ohh, 'kay.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,425
I know, why she's calling.

7
00:00:24,043 --> 00:00:25,956
It's the end of the month,
and I was supposed,

8
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:28,192
to let somebody go by
the end of the month.

9
00:00:30,352 --> 00:00:33,211
And somehow I'm supposed
to put on a costume and smile.

10
00:00:35,355 --> 00:00:37,220
- Okay.
- <i>Jan Levinson's office.</i>

11
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:39,546
Hey, Sherri, Michael Scott returning.

12
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:40,970
<i>Oh, she's in a meeting.</i>

13
00:00:41,496 --> 00:00:44,066
<i>She just wanted the name of
the employee you let go.</i>

14
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:45,883
Well, I'm going to wait
'till the end of the day.

15
00:00:46,027 --> 00:00:48,281
Because the book said it's best
to wait until the end of the day.

16
00:00:48,568 --> 00:00:50,713
<i>I just need the name of who
you're planning to let go.</i>

17
00:00:50,907 --> 00:00:53,953
I don't know yet.

18
00:00:54,068 --> 00:00:56,373
I will have to call her back.

19
00:00:56,646 --> 00:00:58,972
<i>I know she wanted the name.</i>

20
00:00:59,138 --> 00:01:01,230
- Okay, Sherri ?
- <i>Yeah ?</i>

21
00:01:01,555 --> 00:01:04,151
If you were getting fired,

22
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:05,511
how would you wanna be told,

23
00:01:05,587 --> 00:01:08,433
so you could still be friends
with the person firing you ?

24
00:01:10,715 --> 00:01:13,042
<i>Jan wants the name as
soon as possible, Michael.</i>

25
00:01:13,218 --> 00:01:14,520
- Thanks.
- <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

26
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:16,452
I'll call her back.

27
00:01:17,347 --> 00:01:19,892
Wish I could fire Sherri.

28
00:01:20,235 --> 00:01:22,543
- <i>Hey, I'm still here.</i>
- Okay. I'm sorry.

29
00:01:22,728 --> 00:01:23,810

32
00:02:01,896 --> 00:02:05,120
I mean you hear about
lay offs in the news.

33
00:02:05,837 --> 00:02:08,981
but when you actually have to
do it yourself, it is heavy stuff

34
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:12,940
It's, I mean, these are people's
lives you're talking about.

35
00:02:14,158 --> 00:02:16,640
- You wanted me?
- Yes.

36
00:02:23,138 --> 00:02:25,141
- Paper-mвchй ?
- Yes.

37
00:02:25,248 --> 00:02:26,743
- Hmm.
- Yesh

38
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:31,441
Pam, I have to let
somebody go, today.

39
00:02:32,507 --> 00:02:34,903
This is, uh, the hardest
thing I've ever had to do.

40
00:02:35,047 --> 00:02:37,533
Why did you put it off until Halloween ?

41
00:02:37,655 --> 00:02:39,743
Because it's very scary stuff.

42
00:02:39,855 --> 00:02:42,070
I think it's gonna put a
damper on the party a little.

43
00:02:42,225 --> 00:02:44,893
You're worried about the party ?
There's a man's life at stake here.

44
00:02:45,006 --> 00:02:47,313
- So it's a man ?
- No.

45
00:02:47,638 --> 00:02:49,883
Or a woman. A human life.

46
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:53,270
If you had to guess,
ho it would be, based on,

47
00:02:54,907 --> 00:02:56,171
their job performance ?

48
00:02:56,308 --> 00:02:59,070
And who do you think deserved
to be fired? Who would that be?

49
00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:02,270
I just answer the phone.

50
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:05,843
And, sometimes you just
let it go to voicemail.

51
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:14,980
Your costume, is fantastic.

52
00:03:16,267 --> 00:03:19,552
I know. I sent away for
it in July from a catalog.

53
00:03:21,508 --> 00:03:23,443
Oh no, don't, don't, don't, don't.

54
00:03:23,548 --> 00:03:25,670
Aah !

55
00:03:26,316 --> 00:03:28,740
- Okay.
- Oh, man.

56
00:03:29,727 --> 00:03:31,503
Okay, I have to fire somebody.

57
00:03:36,096 --> 00:03:38,272
What is that ?
What are you supposed to be ?

58
00:03:40,117 --> 00:03:42,130
I'm a three hole punch version of Jim.

59
00:03:42,376 --> 00:03:45,682
'Cause you can have me either way.
Plain white Jim, or three-hole punch.

60
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:48,180
- That's great.
- Oh, yeah.

61
00:03:48,656 --> 00:03:51,003
Yeah, well, look, what about me ?

62
00:03:53,706 --> 00:03:56,011
What are you ? A monk ?

63
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:00,070
I am Sith Lord.

64
00:04:01,857 --> 00:04:03,333
Big deal.

65
00:04:03,465 --> 00:04:06,223
Three round pieces of
paper taped to his shirt.

66
00:04:07,175 --> 00:04:10,001
This cost me $129.

67
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:12,351
Ass.

68
00:04:15,465 --> 00:04:17,982
Hey, you guys excited about the party ?

69
00:04:18,116 --> 00:04:20,242
- It's going to be fun.
- Yeah.

70
00:04:20,448 --> 00:04:22,801
Oh, looks at you.

71
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:26,333
Showing your colors.
Bet you wish you wore a dress every day.

72
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,903
- What are you implying ?
- All good.

73
00:04:29,176 --> 00:04:30,392
Happy Halloween.

74
00:04:30,548 --> 00:04:33,353
What  happened to all those
spooky decorations that we had ?

75
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:36,071
- The cobwebs and such?
- You know, I don't know.

76
00:04:36,228 --> 00:04:37,722
We put them all up last night.

77
00:04:42,187 --> 00:04:43,653
Well, you know what ?
Go buy some more.

78
00:04:43,747 --> 00:04:45,421
I'll approve the overages.

79
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:46,590
- Sound good ?
- Yeah.

80
00:04:46,676 --> 00:04:48,200
Good.

81
00:04:48,306 --> 00:04:50,980
Oh, yeah, also, about budget stuff.

82
00:04:52,766 --> 00:04:54,483
I going to need you to find, like

83
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:57,443
a full employee salary,
plus benefits, like fifty grand.

84
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,313
I'm going to need you to find
50 grand in the numbers.

85
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,311
- But we don't keep two sets of books.
- Well, that's not what I'm saying

86
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:07,891
Just, you know, find it.
Pretend that your jobs depend on it.

87
00:05:16,176 --> 00:05:18,690
Interesting take on Dorothy.

88
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:20,552
I love it.
Hey, you know what would even be better?

89
00:05:21,117 --> 00:05:23,571
- Soccer ball and cleats.
- Why is that ?

90
00:05:24,266 --> 00:05:25,742
Bend It Like Beckham.

91
00:05:25,877 --> 00:05:28,291
Oh, like the movie about the
Indian girl who plays soccer?

92
00:05:29,085 --> 00:05:30,353
Yeah.

93
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,522
That would be perfect.

94
00:05:32,677 --> 00:05:35,310
Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that.

95
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,722
I don't really play soccer or anything.

96
00:05:37,807 --> 00:05:40,442
Well, I don't really have two heads, so

97
00:05:40,787 --> 00:05:43,090
Wait, what are you again ? Oh, right.

98
00:05:43,268 --> 00:05:45,482
Three hole PUNCH !

99
00:05:48,305 --> 00:05:51,183
- Okay, greatest strength.
- Okay, okay.

100
00:05:52,545 --> 00:05:55,221
- A dog like obedience to authority.
- Nice.

101
00:05:55,967 --> 00:05:58,613
- But that doesn't sound good.
- Okay, okay.

102
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,511
How 'bout, the ultimate team player ?

103
00:06:02,525 --> 00:06:04,790
Dwight is special.

104
00:06:05,096 --> 00:06:08,480
But, I don't believe his talents
are being used in this office.

105
00:06:09,056 --> 00:06:14,810
So Pam and I have put his resume
on Monster.com, Google, Craig's List.

106
00:06:14,937 --> 00:06:18,921
We're really interested most in
jobs that take Dwight out of state.

107
00:06:19,986 --> 00:06:22,372
Preferably Alaska, or India.

108
00:06:22,468 --> 00:06:23,923
He's a gun nut.

109
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:27,503
He sticks to his guns.

110
00:06:28,378 --> 00:06:30,333
Well,  I looked through all the budgets.

111
00:06:30,507 --> 00:06:32,150
- And there is one department...
- Yes ?

112
00:06:32,248 --> 00:06:33,790
That has three people...
Yeah ?

113
00:06:34,075 --> 00:06:36,260
...doing the work,
that could be done by two.

114
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,241
This is great.

115
00:06:40,426 --> 00:06:41,940
Oh.

116
00:06:42,226 --> 00:06:43,921
Yeah.

117
00:06:44,685 --> 00:06:46,093
Oh.

118
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:47,370
- Who do you think it should be?
- Jim.

119
00:06:47,556 --> 00:06:49,650
- Definitely.
- No, Jim brings in money.

120
00:06:49,806 --> 00:06:51,372
Phyllis.

121
00:06:51,455 --> 00:06:55,073
Stanley. Pam. Oscar. Meredith.

122
00:06:55,686 --> 00:06:57,742
Kevin. Angela.

123
00:06:57,965 --> 00:06:59,550
It's not a popularity contest.

124
00:06:59,696 --> 00:07:02,650
Although it does make sense
to fire the least popular.

125
00:07:02,786 --> 00:07:05,593
Because, it has the least
effect on morale.

126
00:07:06,815 --> 00:07:09,151
One of the warehouse guys. 

127
00:07:09,568 --> 00:07:11,093
What ?

128
00:07:11,685 --> 00:07:13,771
There was someone left off that list?

129
00:07:14,445 --> 00:07:16,350
Who is he saying?

130
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:19,641
You're right, I didn't
even think of him.

131
00:07:19,835 --> 00:07:21,370
No, Michael.

132
00:07:21,456 --> 00:07:25,151
- Yeah, that's actually a really good idea.
- No, not me.

133
00:07:25,266 --> 00:07:27,562
- Yeah I could.
-  Not Dwight

134
00:07:27,675 --> 00:07:30,961
- I'm not saying that's what he said.
- I know that's what he said.

135
00:07:31,395 --> 00:07:32,872
What ?

136
00:07:33,436 --> 00:07:35,132
Tell  him, not Dwight.

137
00:07:35,176 --> 00:07:37,460
That is not a very nice thing to say about him.

138
00:07:37,616 --> 00:07:39,501
- Tell him to stop.
- Are you kidding?

139
00:07:39,606 --> 00:07:42,293
- Quiet you.
- I agree. He'd land on his feet.

140
00:07:42,488 --> 00:07:44,480
Make him be quiet.

141
00:07:47,285 --> 00:07:49,172
Those aren't chips and dip.

142
00:07:49,356 --> 00:07:51,913
No, I made brownies.

143
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:53,980
What ?

144
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:56,836
I'm just trying to figure out
why you're sabotaging things.

145
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:00,760
- I made brownies.
- And I made cookies.

146
00:08:01,056 --> 00:08:02,596
Same category.

147
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:07,480
I'm guessing Angela's the one,

148
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:09,351
in the neighborhood who gives,

149
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:12,901
The trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes

150
00:08:14,117 --> 00:08:16,092
Pennies.

151
00:08:16,645 --> 00:08:17,853
Walnuts.

152
00:08:17,895 --> 00:08:19,643
Dunder Mifflin this is Pam.

153
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,151
Yeah.

154
00:08:24,077 --> 00:08:27,632
Just one second. I will, uh, transfer
you to our manager, Michael Scott.

155
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,531
Michael Scott here.

156
00:08:36,906 --> 00:08:40,090
Yes, I am regional
manager of this orifice

157
00:08:43,145 --> 00:08:45,941
Dwight Schrute, is, amazing.

158
00:08:46,946 --> 00:08:51,910
Yeah. No, he is actually the single
greatest employee of his generation.

159
00:08:54,457 --> 00:08:55,781
You know what ?
I'm gonna tell you what.

160
00:08:55,896 --> 00:08:58,460
You hire Dwight K. Schrute,

161
00:08:58,578 --> 00:09:01,650
and he does not meet, nay, exceed,

162
00:09:01,806 --> 00:09:04,740
every one of your wildest expectations,

163
00:09:04,855 --> 00:09:06,870
well then, you can hold me,

164
00:09:07,007 --> 00:09:12,240
Michael Gary Scott, personally
and financially responsible.

165
00:09:12,656 --> 00:09:16,902
Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay

166
00:09:24,126 --> 00:09:27,282
- Stanley, could you come with me, please.
- No.

167
00:09:30,245 --> 00:09:31,913
As assistant regional manager.

168
00:09:32,098 --> 00:09:33,592
- To the ?
- Look.

169
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:36,681
I've got some bad news.
You're fired.

170
00:09:37,117 --> 00:09:39,071
You need to pack up
your things and go.

171
00:09:39,175 --> 00:09:41,411
I'm serious, Stanley.

172
00:09:41,506 --> 00:09:43,513
It's over, I'm sorry.

173
00:09:43,596 --> 00:09:47,251
You're fired.
Get your fingers off my phone.

174
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:57,111
So, how did it go with Stanley?
How-how'd he take it?

175
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,463
- He wouldn't listen to me
- Oh, come on.

176
00:09:59,575 --> 00:10:01,271
If you want to fire him, you're
going to have to tell him yourself.

177
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,853
I don't wanna fire Stanley,
I never said that.

178
00:10:03,915 --> 00:10:06,481
I'm certainly not going to do it myself.

179
00:10:06,766 --> 00:10:10,593
Get those big, baleful,
eyes staring at me. Yikes

180
00:10:11,418 --> 00:10:14,001
Just, okay, just...

181
00:10:14,637 --> 00:10:17,271
Cumberland Mills?

182
00:10:17,677 --> 00:10:20,240
How did you get my resume?

183
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,962
Oh no, no. I'm very flattered.
Don't get me wrong.

184
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:26,273
I'm just not sure that
it's my official resume.

185
00:10:26,446 --> 00:10:29,093
or if it's something that maybe,

186
00:10:29,447 --> 00:10:32,270
a satisfied customer posted online.

187
00:10:33,295 --> 00:10:36,390
What does it say under
martial arts training ?

188
00:10:37,418 --> 00:10:39,813
Oh, okay, I'm gonna
have to supplement that.

189
00:10:39,876 --> 00:10:42,333
Could I have your fax number?

190
00:10:42,438 --> 00:10:44,261
Would I ever leave this company ?

191
00:10:44,347 --> 00:10:46,390
Look, I'm all about loyalty.

192
00:10:46,476 --> 00:10:49,760
In fact I feel like part of what I'm
getting paid for here is my loyalty.

193
00:10:50,895 --> 00:10:54,631
But, if there were somewhere else
that valued that loyalty more highly.

194
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:58,721
I'm going wherever they
value loyalty the most.

195
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:03,001
Oh, hey.

196
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:07,473
Oh, your dress is stuck in the back.
Kind of just...

197
00:11:07,635 --> 00:11:09,080
Oh.

198
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:15,593
So you got the fax?
So why didn't you add it to the resume

199
00:11:16,518 --> 00:11:19,242
What do you mean ? Of course martial
arts training is relevant.

200
00:11:19,655 --> 00:11:23,162
Oh, excuse me! I know about a billion
Asians that would beg to differ.

201
00:11:25,035 --> 00:11:28,172
get a little frustrated when
I'm dealing with incompetence.

202
00:11:28,507 --> 00:11:29,963
Well, you know what ?
You can go to hell too.

203
00:11:30,008 --> 00:11:32,313
And I will see you there...burning.

204
00:11:32,455 --> 00:11:35,941
Fine! Okay, wait. So you'll let me
know when you've made a decision.

205
00:11:40,918 --> 00:11:43,072
Jim is really talented.

206
00:11:43,315 --> 00:11:46,333
And he should be the one who's
getting a better job offer.

207
00:11:46,946 --> 00:11:48,200
Like, for real.

208
00:11:48,355 --> 00:11:50,253
Don't take this the wrong way.

209
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:52,642
But, you should go for that job.

210
00:11:59,047 --> 00:12:00,263
It's in Maryland

211
00:12:00,435 --> 00:12:03,293
Yeah, but I mean,
look at the salary.

212
00:12:03,568 --> 00:12:06,203
And it's definitely a step up.

213
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:09,112
And a challenge.

214
00:12:10,418 --> 00:12:12,430
Yeah.

215
00:12:14,677 --> 00:12:17,223
Yeah, you know what ? Maybe...

216
00:12:18,507 --> 00:12:20,271
Maybe I will.

217
00:12:23,157 --> 00:12:25,161
Jim...

218
00:12:25,967 --> 00:12:28,771
This is called, leveraging an offer.

219
00:12:30,028 --> 00:12:32,091
- Michael, can I talk to you for a moment
- Oh, God.

220
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,452
I just thought you should know,

221
00:12:35,507 --> 00:12:39,220
that I was just offered
a job with better pay,

222
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:43,141
Better benefits and a better
title at Cumberland Mills.

223
00:12:43,326 --> 00:12:45,442
- Fantastic.
- And I turned it down.

224
00:12:45,587 --> 00:12:48,043
What ? That would've
solvedall my problems.

225
00:12:48,137 --> 00:12:51,723
- Out of loyalty to this company...
- Oh, you idiot.

226
00:12:52,195 --> 00:12:55,683
- So I was hoping to be made assistant
regional manager officially.
- If you left,

227
00:12:55,745 --> 00:12:57,481
I wouldn't have to fire anybody

228
00:12:57,937 --> 00:13:00,392
- But then you wouldn't have me here.
- Big deal, oh !

229
00:13:00,455 --> 00:13:03,201
It would've worked out so well.
Can you get it back ?!

230
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,241
- It's in Maryland.
- You can call, can you call 'em?

231
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:07,912
I can't, I, I suppose, I could, no.

232
00:13:08,706 --> 00:13:11,182
They never really made
me an offer anyway.

233
00:13:11,285 --> 00:13:13,303
Why are you torturing me ?

234
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,420
G od.

235
00:13:16,747 --> 00:13:18,691
Honestly, I don't think that Michael has,

236
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:21,283
the slightest clue of who
he's going to fire.

237
00:13:21,548 --> 00:13:23,702
I think he keeps hoping that
someone's going to volunteer.

238
00:13:23,876 --> 00:13:27,370
Or be run over by a
bus before the deadline.

239
00:13:28,427 --> 00:13:30,002
But in the end, really,
what's going to happen is

240
00:13:30,046 --> 00:13:32,152
It's gonna be the first person to
give him a dirty look in the hall.

241
00:13:33,727 --> 00:13:37,461
And therein lies the true
essence of his charisma.

242
00:13:41,436 --> 00:13:43,431
Yes.

243
00:14:08,506 --> 00:14:11,150
Michael, I really didn't mean to.
Help, me.

244
00:14:12,357 --> 00:14:15,423
- I'm sorry ?
- I want you to role play firing me.

245
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:18,673
I want you to fire me,
and I will take it.

246
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:20,003
- Oh, you want me to be you?
- Yes.

247
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,153
- Okay.
- I want you to be me, and I will be Creed.

248
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:25,240
- Oh, are you firing Creed?
- No, no. No, that's just the first,

249
00:14:25,578 --> 00:14:27,903
Thing...can't, in head.

250
00:14:28,008 --> 00:14:29,872
We should switch seats in order to..

251
00:14:30,456 --> 00:14:32,942
- Yes, that's a good idea.
- Alright.

252
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:35,651
Excuse me.

253
00:14:40,038 --> 00:14:41,960
I'm really sorry, but
I have to let you go.

254
00:14:42,318 --> 00:14:46,070
And it's purely budgetary,
it's not personal.

255
00:14:49,437 --> 00:14:51,782
- Wow.
- I'm going to kill myself,

256
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:54,573
- And it's your fault !
- That's an overreaction.

257
00:14:54,748 --> 00:14:57,220
Corporate is really
breathing down my neck.

258
00:14:57,357 --> 00:14:59,022
And they're saying this has to be done,

259
00:14:59,116 --> 00:15:00,650
- by the end of the month.
- Is this you?

260
00:15:00,787 --> 00:15:02,722
Is this you? Are you being you,
or is this Creed? Are you..

261
00:15:02,838 --> 00:15:04,880
I,

262
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:07,032
- This is Creed.
- Okay.

263
00:15:07,128 --> 00:15:09,480
I'm improvising, so just try to keep up.

264
00:15:09,655 --> 00:15:12,312
- Hold that thought. Hold that thought.
- And I'm very angry, and I want...

265
00:15:12,397 --> 00:15:15,612
- Michael Scott here. Toby ?
- I'm gonna kill you for firing me.

266
00:15:16,088 --> 00:15:18,523
I really have to take this Creed,
so it was really worth...

267
00:15:18,565 --> 00:15:21,130
- Get off, get off. No, no.
- Okay.

268
00:15:26,837 --> 00:15:28,941
Just, just, yeah.

269
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:33,933
- What happened ?
- It wasn't me.

270
00:15:34,047 --> 00:15:37,462
- Oh. That was like crazy. 'Cause I was
- Yeah, I know.

271
00:15:47,828 --> 00:15:49,762
- Creed ?
- Huh ?

272
00:15:49,846 --> 00:15:52,542
Could I talk to you for a second ?

273
00:15:56,568 --> 00:16:00,350
You are great. Very ambitious.

274
00:16:01,468 --> 00:16:04,852
And I feel like you want more
than this little office has to offer.

275
00:16:05,095 --> 00:16:07,963
And I understand that you'd
wanna just spread your wings,

276
00:16:08,686 --> 00:16:11,533
- And fly the coop.
- What are you telling me ?

277
00:16:11,618 --> 00:16:15,312
I, we're gonna have to...
You, you want something better.

278
00:16:15,398 --> 00:16:17,830
No, I don't. I wanna stay right here.

279
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:21,312
- No, you wanna leave.
- No, I wanna stay here

280
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:24,132
Why, why are you making this so hard ?

281
00:16:24,215 --> 00:16:27,021
- I think there's a misunderstanding, Michael. 
- I think you're right.

282
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:29,360
- Can I go?
- No, of course, you can't go

283
00:16:29,477 --> 00:16:33,063
We haven't even started
this horrible process of.

284
00:16:33,806 --> 00:16:36,152
Okay, Creed.

285
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,941
I need to let somebody go today.

286
00:16:41,095 --> 00:16:43,572
They told me I need to let somebody go.

287
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:46,391
And as much as I think you're
a great guy, and I like you,

288
00:16:46,468 --> 00:16:49,293
You're-you're, good-bye.

289
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:52,081
Let's fight it.

290
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:55,112
Let's  call Jan and fight this
thing together like the old days.

291
00:16:55,195 --> 00:16:56,813
What old days?
What are you talking about?

292
00:16:56,935 --> 00:16:58,653
Did you start the paperwork yet?

293
00:16:58,758 --> 00:17:01,090
- It's right here on the desk, yeah.
- You don't have to do this Michael.

294
00:17:01,306 --> 00:17:03,483
- I can't, I can't...
- Undo it!

295
00:17:03,587 --> 00:17:04,720
<i>I can't change anything.</i>

296
00:17:04,888 --> 00:17:06,450
- This is the way...</i>
- No

297
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:08,193


298
00:17:06,486 --> 00:17:08,190
Michael, undo it !
I don't...

299
00:17:08,355 --> 00:17:10,063
- <i>No, you have the
power to undo it.</i>

300
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:12,211
Yeah, I went hunting once.

301
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,233
Shot the deer in the leg,

302
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,423
had to kill it with a shovel.
Took about an hour.

303
00:17:17,048 --> 00:17:18,252
Why do you ask?

304
00:17:18,316 --> 00:17:20,893
I have to fire someone today. Okay?

305
00:17:21,398 --> 00:17:23,610
Fine. Fire someone else.

306
00:17:23,848 --> 00:17:25,832
Fire Devon, he's terrible.

307
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:28,391
I am so much better at
my job than Devon.

308
00:17:28,536 --> 00:17:31,610
Okay, well, I already picked you.
And you know that.

309
00:17:31,698 --> 00:17:34,652
So, unless I just go through with this,

310
00:17:34,745 --> 00:17:37,161
You're always gonna look at me
as the guy who almost fired you.

311
00:17:37,286 --> 00:17:39,853
No, no, no, no, no,
I will forget so fast.

312
00:17:39,955 --> 00:17:41,533
You will be my savior.

313
00:17:41,676 --> 00:17:45,033
You're they guy who
gave me my life back.

314
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:48,273
Thank you.
I knew you'd see it my way Michael,

315
00:17:48,345 --> 00:17:50,413
- God Bless you. You're a fine man.
- Don't...

316
00:17:50,857 --> 00:17:52,681
Listen, you will not regret this either.

317
00:17:52,727 --> 00:17:55,673
Devon's terrible.
No one's gonna miss him.

318
00:17:56,128 --> 00:17:58,140
Good, good, good.

319
00:18:14,237 --> 00:18:17,302
Devon, could I talk to you for a sec?

320
00:18:17,756 --> 00:18:20,002
- Creed's an idiot, you know that.
- Well, he...

321
00:18:20,085 --> 00:18:22,880
No, no, no, no, no.
You had it right the first time.

322
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,970
- Well, maybe I did.
- Exactly.

323
00:18:25,058 --> 00:18:26,613
You gotta go with your gut man.

324
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:32,173
No. I can't, no. I can't go back.

325
00:18:32,335 --> 00:18:33,940
I would look like an idiot.

326
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:35,692
- That's why I'm being fired?
- No.

327
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:37,060
So you might not look like an idiot ?

328
00:18:37,126 --> 00:18:38,581
No. It was all the stuff that I said.

329
00:18:38,655 --> 00:18:41,421
It was business downturn,
the cutbacks, and, and...

330
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,662
This is unbelievable!

331
00:18:43,898 --> 00:18:46,921
I just hope that you and
I can remain friends.

332
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,660
Devon wait, please.

333
00:18:51,947 --> 00:18:53,331
Look, look.

334
00:18:55,076 --> 00:18:56,780
In addition to severance,

335
00:18:56,845 --> 00:19:00,891
and everything, I want to give you,

336
00:19:02,118 --> 00:19:05,321
This gift certificate to Chili's.
From me.

337
00:19:07,118 --> 00:19:09,003
Okay? No hard feelings.

338
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:15,753
Kevin, Jim, Pam, Kelly, Toby,

339
00:19:15,866 --> 00:19:19,560
Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis,
Stanley, or the temp.

340
00:19:20,095 --> 00:19:22,940
If any of you wanna meet me for a drink,
I'm going to be a Poor Richard's

341
00:19:23,256 --> 00:19:25,682
And the rest of you can go to hell.

342
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,013
What about the Halloween party ?

343
00:19:39,035 --> 00:19:41,271
Hey, Jim. Wait, stop.

344
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:45,832
I'am sorry for pushing
you towards Cumberland.

345
00:19:47,778 --> 00:19:50,153
Seriously, if you left here,
I would blow my brains out.

346
00:19:53,136 --> 00:19:54,590
Come on.

347
00:19:55,515 --> 00:19:57,592
That's just a figure of speech.
You know ?

348
00:19:57,718 --> 00:19:59,630
Blow your brains out ? Come on.

349
00:19:59,957 --> 00:20:02,542
All it really means is
that we're friends.

350
00:20:02,866 --> 00:20:05,871
I mean, who else is she gonna talk to...
If I'm gone, right?

351
00:20:06,315 --> 00:20:08,491
I mean, if she left, I wouldn't
blow my brains out.

352
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:11,220
Of course, I would take
that job in Maryland.

353
00:20:11,275 --> 00:20:12,883
Because it's double the pay,

354
00:20:12,996 --> 00:20:16,362
and soft shell crab just
happens to be my favorite food.

355
00:20:24,777 --> 00:20:27,471
I love Halloween. You know,
it's just, it's just fun

356
00:20:27,545 --> 00:20:29,270
Every year, it's just fun.

357
00:20:29,408 --> 00:20:32,183
Last Halloween I came as
Janet Jackson's boob.

358
00:20:34,135 --> 00:20:36,873
It was topical. 
People got a big kick out of it.

359
00:20:37,055 --> 00:20:39,702
The year before that,
I came as Monica Lewinsky.

360
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:42,742
And I wore a stained dress.

361
00:20:43,388 --> 00:20:45,732
The year before that, I also
came as Monica Lewinsky.

362
00:20:46,305 --> 00:20:48,512
And before that, I was O.J.

363
00:20:48,687 --> 00:20:50,350
It was pretty funny.

364
00:20:50,468 --> 00:20:52,872
Oh, I wish you were here last year.

365
00:21:01,447 --> 00:21:02,973
Trick or treat !

366
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:05,232
Hey,  how you doing ?

367
00:21:05,338 --> 00:21:07,273
Wow ! You guys looks great.

368
00:21:07,418 --> 00:21:09,030
I'm a bumble bee.

369
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:10,781
You look great !

370
00:21:10,828 --> 00:21:12,993
- And you're a princess?
- A fairy princess.

371
00:21:13,107 --> 00:21:15,321
- A fairy princess, you're...
- I'm a lion.

372
00:21:15,427 --> 00:21:17,902
You're a lion. Wow,
I want to hear your...Oh !

373
00:21:17,998 --> 00:21:20,460
Oh, okay, that's all yours.
That's all yours.

You guys are getting all of these.

1
00:00:04,888 --> 00:00:05,982
Where is my desk ?

2
00:00:08,266 --> 00:00:09,009
That is weird.

3
00:00:09,825 --> 00:00:12,885
This is not funny, this is totally
unprofessional.

4
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:14,879
Okay, well, you're the
one who lost the desk.

5
00:00:14,988 --> 00:00:17,286
- I didn't lose my desk
- Okay, calm down.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,972
Where was the last place
you saw it ?

7
00:00:19,008 --> 00:00:20,440
Okay, who moved my desk ?

8
00:00:20,973 --> 00:00:22,569
I think you should
retrace your steps.

9
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:25,251
Okay, I am going to tell Michael.

10
00:00:25,477 --> 00:00:28,330
And this entire office
will be punished.

11
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:30,326
Colder.

12
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:34,530
Warmer.

13
00:00:35,606 --> 00:00:36,966
Little warmer.

14
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,841
There you go, ooh, warmer.

15
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:41,640
Warmer.

16
00:00:42,097 --> 00:00:43,343
Warmer, warmer !

17
00:00:43,547 --> 00:00:45,211
Warmer, cold, cold ! Cold !

18
00:00:45,285 --> 00:00:46,372
Back up !

19
00:00:47,996 --> 00:00:50,753
Ooh, ooh, warmer.

20
00:00:50,997 --> 00:00:52,693
Hot, red hot. Hot.

21
00:00:53,737 --> 00:00:54,973
Very hot.

22
00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:09,872
- Dwight Schrute.
- Hi Dwight !

23
00:01:10,418 --> 00:01:13,510
What sort of discounts are we giving
on the 20 pound white bond ?

24
00:01:13,746 --> 00:01:16,010
Jim, I've given you this
information like 20 times.

25
00:01:16,055 --> 00:01:17,273
<i>I know.</i>

26
00:01:21,107 --> 00:01:22,423
It's by the ream ?

27
00:01:22,826 --> 00:01:25,300
- <i>Uh, yeah.</i>
- It is now 9.78.

28
00:01:25,508 --> 00:01:28,253
- So it's a discount of 7%.
- Okay thank you,

29
00:01:28,476 --> 00:01:30,142
I got to get back to work.

30
00:01:34,607 --> 00:01:35,993
Wash your hands Kevin.

35
00:02:11,057 --> 00:02:14,292
Right. Oh, well,
let me just check the pricing list.

36
00:02:14,337 --> 00:02:16,083
- Hold on one second.
- Sensei...

37
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:17,782
Hello, it's sempai.

38
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:20,903
Dwight.

39
00:02:21,087 --> 00:02:23,201
You know what, let me give
you a call right back.

40
00:02:23,247 --> 00:02:25,700
I'm going to find it and then
I'll call you back. Thanks.

41
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:28,873
Yes, I just had a ques...
Yes, sensei.

42
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,202
Arigato goazai mashta. Hai.

43
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:38,683
- Was that you mom ?
- No. That was my sensei.

44
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:43,163
- Thought it was your mom.
- I am now sempai,

45
00:02:43,977 --> 00:02:45,833
which is assistant sensei.

46
00:02:46,018 --> 00:02:47,902
Assistant to the sensei,
that's pretty cool.

47
00:02:47,955 --> 00:02:49,673
- Assistant sensei.
- Okay.

48
00:02:49,806 --> 00:02:54,593
I am a practitioner of Goju-Ryu
ka-ra-te, here in Scranton.

49
00:02:55,197 --> 00:02:56,863
- Hai !
- 2 !

50
00:02:56,956 --> 00:02:59,612
- Hai !
- Dwight, stamp and kick back. 3.

51
00:02:59,767 --> 00:03:05,140
My sensei, Ira, recently
promoted me to purple belt.

52
00:03:05,365 --> 00:03:08,081
And gave me duties of a sempai.

53
00:03:08,535 --> 00:03:11,653
Not that a lot of people here in
America know what a sempai is.

54
00:03:11,728 --> 00:03:14,692
But it's equally as
respected as a sensei.

55
00:03:19,698 --> 00:03:22,272
I don't want to stay until
7:00 again this year.

56
00:03:22,797 --> 00:03:25,571
I don't really have any
control over that, Stanley.

57
00:03:30,228 --> 00:03:34,210
Michael tends to procrastinate...
a bit whenever he has to do work.

58
00:03:36,248 --> 00:03:39,370
Time cards.
He has to sign these every Friday.

59
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,460
Purchase orders have to be approved
at the end of every month.

60
00:03:42,568 --> 00:03:44,453
And expense reports.

61
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:48,491
All he has to do is initial these,
at the end of every quarter.

62
00:03:48,605 --> 00:03:52,571
But once a year, it all falls on
the same Friday. And that's today.

63
00:03:52,825 --> 00:03:54,750
I call it the perfect storm.

64
00:03:54,965 --> 00:03:56,993
"I don't want to work,"

65
00:03:57,357 --> 00:03:59,901
"I just want to bang
on this mug all day."

66
00:03:59,935 --> 00:04:02,021
Did you ask me here
for any specific reason?

67
00:04:02,087 --> 00:04:04,983
Ah, yes, I did.
Here's the bizzle.

68
00:04:06,338 --> 00:04:09,683
I have a very top secret
mission for you.

69
00:04:09,725 --> 00:04:13,191
I want you to update all the
emergency contact information.

70
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:15,982
- Why is that secret ?
- Hello. Oh, God

71
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:18,372
Busy work.
Ah, get away, get away. Cretin.

72
00:04:19,028 --> 00:04:20,802
I put stickers so you know
where to sign.

73
00:04:20,846 --> 00:04:22,272
Yes, thanks, I know where to sign.

74
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:23,621
It's  just that last year, you...

75
00:04:23,678 --> 00:04:26,170
Last year, they were out of
order, weren't they, Pam.

76
00:04:26,576 --> 00:04:30,372
Well, the last pickup for
overnight deliveries is at 7:00.

77
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:33,692
So you need to have them
signed by then. Or much earlier.

78
00:04:33,746 --> 00:04:36,772
Shalax, Pam.
Stop Pam-MSing.

79
00:04:38,005 --> 00:04:39,021
That's pretty good.

80
00:04:39,098 --> 00:04:41,442
Actually, I'm sending Ryan
on a top secret mission.

81
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:43,853
Tell her what it is.

82
00:04:44,216 --> 00:04:46,022
Updating emergency contacts ?

83
00:04:47,628 --> 00:04:49,463
Well, is that really a priority ?

84
00:04:49,567 --> 00:04:51,423
Is it a priority ?
Oh, I don't know.

85
00:04:52,137 --> 00:04:54,221
What if there's a tornado, Pam ?

86
00:04:54,278 --> 00:04:56,232
People's legs are crushed
under rubble.

87
00:04:56,398 --> 00:04:59,922
Please, would you be so kind as to
call my wife ? No I can't.

88
00:05:00,036 --> 00:05:02,812
Because we don't have any
emergency contact information.

89
00:05:02,868 --> 00:05:04,820
Because Pam said
it wasn't a priority.

90
00:05:04,965 --> 00:05:06,410
Think. Think with your head Pam.

91
00:05:06,525 --> 00:05:08,322
Okay, well, she walks out.

92
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,983
That's the problem with being a
boss, is that when you are tough,

93
00:05:12,237 --> 00:05:15,130
they resent you, and when you
are cool, they walk all over you.

94
00:05:16,276 --> 00:05:20,242
- Catch-22.
- Catch-22,  yes.

95
00:05:23,788 --> 00:05:26,320
Why don't you give me your contact
information to start with ?

96
00:05:26,377 --> 00:05:27,723
Okay? What's your cell ?

97
00:05:28,515 --> 00:05:31,870
- Larissa Halpert.
- What's her address ?

98
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:35,393
- 117 Vonburgen Street.
- Hello.

99
00:05:36,288 --> 00:05:37,700
<i>Hey Ryan.</i>

100
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:43,851
This is Michael Jackson,
calling from Wonderland.

101
00:05:44,838 --> 00:05:46,010
You mean Neverland ?

102
00:05:47,865 --> 00:05:49,461
This is Tito.

103
00:05:53,065 --> 00:05:54,333
What ?

104
00:05:56,137 --> 00:05:57,641
<i>Calling from...</i>

105
00:05:58,335 --> 00:06:01,073
Your major and minor
lines cross at a ridge.

106
00:06:02,508 --> 00:06:03,692
That sucks.

107
00:06:03,838 --> 00:06:05,992
You're making this up as
you go along, aren't you ?

108
00:06:06,036 --> 00:06:10,313
- I am just following the web site.
- Well, at least I don't have cavities.

109
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:12,830
Yes, you have very nice teeth.

110
00:06:13,105 --> 00:06:14,303
T hanks

111
00:06:14,826 --> 00:06:16,440
Who's your emergency contact ?

112
00:06:17,157 --> 00:06:18,553
Stacey.

113
00:06:23,325 --> 00:06:24,711
Pick up.

114
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:28,351
Hello ?

115
00:06:29,368 --> 00:06:31,112
This is Mike Tyson.

116
00:06:34,037 --> 00:06:35,633
Hey, Dwight.

117
00:06:36,678 --> 00:06:39,833
As sempai, do you ever think
there's gonna be a day,

118
00:06:40,186 --> 00:06:43,322
where humans and robots can
peacefully coexist ?

119
00:06:44,155 --> 00:06:45,440
Impossible.

120
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:47,302
The way they're programmed...

121
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:51,150
- You're mocking me.
- No, I'm not.

122
00:06:51,198 --> 00:06:53,492
Well, let me offer you
a little piece of advice.

123
00:06:54,068 --> 00:06:57,222
I am not afraid, to make
an example out of you.

124
00:06:57,885 --> 00:07:00,853
That's not advice.
What advice sounds like is this.

125
00:07:02,248 --> 00:07:04,841
Don't ever bring your
purple belt to work,

126
00:07:05,138 --> 00:07:07,480
because someone might... 
steal it.

127
00:07:07,565 --> 00:07:09,622
- Okay, give that back to me.
- Okay, say please.

128
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,710
- No, that is not a toy.
- Please.

129
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:13,122
- Please ?
- Good.

130
00:07:13,177 --> 00:07:15,450
And it absolutely is a toy.
Arigato.

131
00:07:15,725 --> 00:07:18,711
Arigato. This is not a toy.
This is a message,

132
00:07:19,695 --> 00:07:21,270
for the entire office.

133
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:24,441
So that everyone could see that I am
capable of physically dominating them.

134
00:07:27,828 --> 00:07:30,822
And this is more of
a ying yang thing.

135
00:07:31,036 --> 00:07:33,943
The Michael is all cursive,
Scott all caps.

136
00:07:34,197 --> 00:07:35,573
Left  brain, right brain.

137
00:07:36,107 --> 00:07:38,143
Or duality of man.

138
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:40,661
Could you practice on the forms ?

139
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:47,491
No women or children,
unless provoked.

140
00:07:47,558 --> 00:07:48,920
Okay, Roy.

141
00:07:49,216 --> 00:07:51,540
- Warehouse guy. Doesn't count.
- Okay

142
00:07:51,647 --> 00:07:53,141
Michael. Could you beat up Michael ?

143
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,480
Yeah, I don't think
that would happen.

144
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:58,316
- Cause we're friends.
- Because I would kick his ass.

145
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:01,130
Well, Dwight's a purple belt. So...

146
00:08:01,206 --> 00:08:03,636
So ? I've beat up black belts.
Yeah.

147
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,102
How'd you know they were
black belts ?

148
00:08:06,197 --> 00:08:07,620
They told me, after.

149
00:08:08,638 --> 00:08:12,492
See, I used to run with a very
tough crowd, street fighter types.

150
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,380
Real, real bad people.

151
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:16,983
I'm just lucky I got out.

152
00:08:17,567 --> 00:08:19,513
Is your wife still your contact ?

153
00:08:19,935 --> 00:08:21,641
Ex-wife, yeah.

154
00:08:22,778 --> 00:08:24,672
Her last name is Becker now.

155
00:08:26,435 --> 00:08:27,433
Okay.

156
00:08:27,616 --> 00:08:28,973
You don't need to write ex.

157
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:34,160
And after that, nobody ever messed
with the damn rascals ever again.

158
00:08:34,537 --> 00:08:36,131
Sounds tough.

159
00:08:36,445 --> 00:08:38,690
When you're a jet, your're a jet
all the way, right ?

160
00:08:38,745 --> 00:08:39,710
You're a jet ?

161
00:08:39,928 --> 00:08:41,623
Have you signed
the expense reports yet?

162
00:08:41,658 --> 00:08:43,282
Yes, in theory I have.

163
00:08:43,318 --> 00:08:45,850
I just need to cross some
Ts and dot some Is.

164
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:48,740
Alright.

165
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:53,120
I am going to be in my office
if anybody needs me.

166
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:55,603
Oh Michael !

167
00:08:56,465 --> 00:08:59,191
Sleeper hold. Bedtime for vato.

168
00:08:59,698 --> 00:09:03,361
- Stop it.
- You are, the weakest link !

169
00:09:04,897 --> 00:09:07,250
I'm friends with everybody
in this office.

170
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,401
We're all best friends
I love everybody here.

171
00:09:10,558 --> 00:09:13,072
But sometimes your best friends,

172
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:17,661
start coming in to work late and,
start having dentist appointments

173
00:09:17,727 --> 00:09:19,123
that aren't dentist appointments.

174
00:09:19,176 --> 00:09:21,310
And that is when it's nice
to let them know

175
00:09:21,376 --> 00:09:23,233
that you could beat them up.

176
00:09:23,356 --> 00:09:26,110
- Just hit me. You'll see.
- I can't,

177
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:28,942
- cause I just got a manicure. So...
- Oh, queer !

178
00:09:29,555 --> 00:09:32,153
Eye, Queer Eye. That's a good show.
Important show.

179
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:34,222
Go ahead, do it.

180
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,300
- Just have Dwight punch you.
- Oh, yeah

181
00:09:36,748 --> 00:09:38,352
Well, that would be
kind of worthless,

182
00:09:38,398 --> 00:09:41,190
because I know a ton of 14 years
old girls who could kick his ass.

183
00:09:41,236 --> 00:09:44,000
- You know a ton of 14-year-old girls ?
- What belt are they ?

184
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,013
Look, Dwight is a wuss.

185
00:09:46,348 --> 00:09:47,943
- When we rented Armageddon...
- No...

186
00:09:48,028 --> 00:09:49,500
he cried at the end of it.
He did.

187
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:50,540
Michael, I told you...

188
00:09:50,585 --> 00:09:52,223
That was because it was
New Year's Eve,

189
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:54,091
and it started to snow
at exactly midnight.

190
00:09:54,158 --> 00:09:56,791
"Oh, Bruce Willis, they're going to
leave him on the asteroid."

191
00:09:56,836 --> 00:09:59,000
- Okay I'll punch you.
- Okay, here we go.

192
00:09:59,325 --> 00:10:00,511
Alright, come on.

193
00:10:06,685 --> 00:10:09,900
Did I want to harm Michael, the one
man I've been hired to protect ?

194
00:10:10,438 --> 00:10:12,380
- No, I did not.
- Are you okay ?

195
00:10:12,547 --> 00:10:14,371
- Yes.
- Are you sure you're all right ?

196
00:10:14,415 --> 00:10:17,541
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.

197
00:10:23,305 --> 00:10:25,071
I come from a long line of fighters.

198
00:10:25,368 --> 00:10:28,370
My maternal grandfather, was
the toughest guy I ever knew.

199
00:10:28,745 --> 00:10:31,321
World War II veteran.
Killed 20 men,

200
00:10:31,668 --> 00:10:34,520
then spent the rest of the
war in an allied prison camp.

201
00:10:35,098 --> 00:10:40,000
My father battled blood
pressure and obesity all his life.

202
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,500
Different kind of fight.

203
00:10:44,096 --> 00:10:45,871
Okay, he has to be stopped.

204
00:10:45,995 --> 00:10:48,783
Please, please, please,
please, just ask Michael.

205
00:10:51,028 --> 00:10:52,201
- I don't know.
- <i>Okay</i>

206
00:10:55,598 --> 00:10:57,010
Okay. I'll buy you a bag of chips.

207
00:10:57,046 --> 00:10:58,200
<i>Why are you twisting around?</i>

208
00:10:58,236 --> 00:10:59,820
- French onion ?
- Obviously.

209
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:01,331
<i>Kevin, why are you
spinning around ?</i>

210
00:11:01,366 --> 00:11:02,381
- Okay.
- Yes.

211
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:04,752
Take this pen, okay.

212
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,762
<i>And stab me with it.</i>

213
00:11:07,615 --> 00:11:09,581
- <i>Go away.</i>
- I just have a quick question.

214
00:11:09,945 --> 00:11:12,122
I haven't signed them, okay ?

215
00:11:12,575 --> 00:11:13,961
No, it's not that.

216
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:17,910
I was just wondering, since I'm
probably going to have to stay late

217
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:21,963
could you ask Dwight to stay late too,
so he can walk me to my car ?

218
00:11:23,025 --> 00:11:23,852
<i>Nice.</i>

219
00:11:24,527 --> 00:11:25,673
<i>Come in.</i>

220
00:11:28,858 --> 00:11:30,422
Pam, I hate to break this to you,

221
00:11:30,485 --> 00:11:32,752
but Dwight can't stop you
from being mugged.

222
00:11:33,188 --> 00:11:34,581
He's just not tough enough.

223
00:11:34,647 --> 00:11:36,322
He's a purple belt.
That's really high.

224
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,420
I could beat up Dwight.
That's ridiculous.

225
00:11:38,456 --> 00:11:39,562
I can murder him.

226
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,663
- It's just that out there, you...
- Oh, is that what they're saying?

227
00:11:42,817 --> 00:11:44,263
- Yeah, kind of.
- Okay.

228
00:11:44,676 --> 00:11:45,782
Alright.

229
00:11:46,515 --> 00:11:47,523
Where's Dwight ?

230
00:11:47,577 --> 00:11:48,901
- Kitchen.
- Okay.

231
00:11:53,817 --> 00:11:55,062
<i>Try it again. Here we go.</i>

232
00:11:55,925 --> 00:11:56,521
Good.

233
00:11:56,558 --> 00:11:58,700
- It way actually pretty good, right ?
- Excellent.

234
00:11:58,726 --> 00:12:00,380
Now  watch.
Let me take you from behind.

235
00:12:00,427 --> 00:12:02,233
Watch out Kelly,
might sucker punch you.

236
00:12:02,376 --> 00:12:04,512
- I didn't sucker punch you Michael.
- No, really ?

237
00:12:04,565 --> 00:12:07,201
In case you didn't remember,
I was defending my honor.

238
00:12:07,297 --> 00:12:09,121
- Like samouraп.
- Really, oh, is that it ?

239
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,630
Well, the offer, Dwight,
was for one punch,

240
00:12:11,646 --> 00:12:13,321
which I absorbed.

241
00:12:13,395 --> 00:12:17,773
I had no idea that there'd be a
second punch. So, catch-22.

242
00:12:17,936 --> 00:12:20,420
Okay, fine, tit for tit.

243
00:12:20,717 --> 00:12:23,103
Give it your best shot,
two punches, go.

244
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:24,992
Look, if we were in a bar,

245
00:12:25,075 --> 00:12:26,691
right now, there would be
two punches.

246
00:12:26,737 --> 00:12:28,521
Me punching you and
you hitting the floor.

247
00:12:28,567 --> 00:12:30,750
No, I'd block your first punch,
rending ineffective.

248
00:12:30,777 --> 00:12:31,590
- Really
- Yeah

249
00:12:31,635 --> 00:12:34,222
You know what, you're just lucky
that we're at work right now.

250
00:12:34,275 --> 00:12:37,093
- What about, Dwight's dojo ?
- No, they just have classes.

251
00:12:37,118 --> 00:12:38,640
It's free during the day,
it's fine.

252
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:39,843
- Look !
- I've got the key.

253
00:12:39,867 --> 00:12:41,091
- Hey, Michael !
- Hey, Toby.

254
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:41,952
Any word on those...

255
00:12:42,007 --> 00:12:45,000
You know what ? I have an idea,
why don't you just leave right now?

256
00:12:45,195 --> 00:12:47,521
Why don't you walk away
from the room, okay ?

257
00:12:48,817 --> 00:12:50,030
Fine.

258
00:12:50,205 --> 00:12:51,793
We'll go at lunch.

259
00:12:52,415 --> 00:12:54,791
Pam, make an announcement.

260
00:12:56,065 --> 00:12:57,610
Figure out carpools.

261
00:13:00,616 --> 00:13:03,191
<i>Well, we're all getting
excited to see this fight</i>

262
00:13:03,327 --> 00:13:06,710
The Albany branch is working right
through lunch to prevent downsizing.

263
00:13:06,955 --> 00:13:10,501
But Michael, he decided to
extend our lunch by an hour...

264
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:14,200
so that we could all go down to
the dojo and watch him fight Dwight.

265
00:13:15,015 --> 00:13:19,513
Fight, Fight, fight, fight, fight,
fight, fight, I'm coming, fight.

266
00:13:24,267 --> 00:13:25,283
Sorry.

267
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:38,203
I recognize that. That is Japanese
for California roll.

268
00:13:38,437 --> 00:13:39,441
No it's not.

269
00:13:39,477 --> 00:13:41,161
I think it is, a guy told me
about that.

270
00:13:41,205 --> 00:13:43,451
Actually, it's a symbol
for eternal discipline.

271
00:13:44,398 --> 00:13:46,813
- Wow, that is really interesting.
- What ?

272
00:13:47,165 --> 00:13:49,571
Your love line... I'm just kidding,
I can't see anything.

273
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,040
Look closer.

274
00:13:51,895 --> 00:13:53,610
- Oh-kay.
- One point for me.

275
00:13:53,645 --> 00:13:54,810
- Tied up.
- Oh you're dead

276
00:13:54,855 --> 00:13:57,413
What ? What are you going to do?
Bring it Beesly. Bring it.

277
00:13:57,577 --> 00:13:58,951
Ooh, yeah. Good move.

278
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,382
Ooh, not such an ultimate
fighter now, huh ?

279
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:03,690
Hey, put me down.
Put me down !

280
00:14:04,107 --> 00:14:05,851
Oh my God. Hey, put me down.

281
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,260
Hey. 

282
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,913
Okay, gentlemen, listen up.

283
00:14:14,545 --> 00:14:16,280
After a clean strike to the chest,

284
00:14:16,376 --> 00:14:19,921
stomach, or kidneys, I will
separate you and award a point.

285
00:14:20,158 --> 00:14:21,650
First person to three wins, alright?

286
00:14:21,696 --> 00:14:23,591
- Yes, sensei !
- Lot of rules. Lot of rules.

287
00:14:23,638 --> 00:14:26,232
On the street, we didn't
have any rules. Maybe one,

288
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:28,092
no kicks to the groin,
home for dinner.

289
00:14:28,545 --> 00:14:29,601
Hajime!

290
00:14:31,077 --> 00:14:32,661
-  What the hell was that ?
- Dwight.

291
00:14:32,687 --> 00:14:33,633
- Yes.
- No way.

292
00:14:33,646 --> 00:14:34,510
- One point.
- Okay.

293
00:14:34,538 --> 00:14:35,422
- Eat it !
- Alright

294
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,471
- That's the way you want to do it ?
- Two more.

295
00:14:37,506 --> 00:14:39,700
You want to play dirty, huh?
Okay, game on, man.

296
00:14:39,836 --> 00:14:42,103
- Sweep the leg.
- I'm coming at you, man.

297
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,523
Ha ! Okay, purple belt.

298
00:14:51,145 --> 00:14:52,533
- Okay, I got it.
- No.

299
00:14:52,595 --> 00:14:54,313
- I got his pants.
- That was my pants.

300
00:14:54,775 --> 00:14:56,343
No points for pants.

301
00:14:56,995 --> 00:14:59,602
Dwight, you have...
No, look. No, you have something...

302
00:14:59,707 --> 00:15:00,972
You have something...

303
00:15:01,226 --> 00:15:03,023
God, you look like such an idiot.

304
00:15:12,195 --> 00:15:13,271
Clean technique gentlemen.

305
00:15:13,388 --> 00:15:15,812
Come on. Do that again.
Do that again. I dare you.

306
00:15:17,657 --> 00:15:20,131
Okay, break. Break. No holding.

307
00:15:20,205 --> 00:15:22,631
Oh, you can't see ?
You can't see ?

308
00:15:23,128 --> 00:15:25,183
One point. Two points. Three points.

309
00:15:25,295 --> 00:15:27,283
- I said break.
- How many points now ?

310
00:15:27,357 --> 00:15:28,673
I win, I win.

311
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:32,200
No, you didn't.

312
00:15:33,577 --> 00:15:35,563
Eight points, nine points.

313
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,492
Stop it. No.

314
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:40,531
Come on, Michael!

315
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:42,572
- Open your mouth.
- No, Michael !

316
00:15:58,227 --> 00:15:59,341
You talkin' to me ?

317
00:16:00,158 --> 00:16:01,620
You talkin' to me ?

318
00:16:02,448 --> 00:16:04,071
Raging Bull, Pacino.

319
00:16:04,636 --> 00:16:06,883
Oh, I want that footage.
I want it. I need it.

320
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,062
Oh, I have to get back to work.
I have lots of work.

321
00:16:10,855 --> 00:16:12,871
Check this out, come here.

322
00:16:13,047 --> 00:16:15,353
There he is, Mr.Temp.

323
00:16:15,445 --> 00:16:17,943
Having lunch by the car.

324
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:20,740
Let us play with him.

325
00:16:20,797 --> 00:16:22,381
See what we can learn.

326
00:16:29,425 --> 00:16:31,421
Oh, we're playing phone tag.

327
00:16:32,597 --> 00:16:34,533
<i>Seven new messages.</i>

328
00:16:34,607 --> 00:16:36,121
<i>First new message.</i>

329
00:16:36,236 --> 00:16:38,942
<i>Hi, Ryan. This is Saddam Hussein.</i>

330
00:16:39,937 --> 00:16:43,453
<i>- Next message.</i>
<i>- Hey Ryan, this is your girlfriend.</i>

331
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:45,440
<i>And I'm mad.</i>

332
00:17:07,198 --> 00:17:10,582
My emergency contact
is Todd Packer.

333
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:13,971
Todd F. Packer

334
00:17:14,056 --> 00:17:16,292
- You know what the F stands for ?
- Fudge ?

335
00:17:17,076 --> 00:17:19,053
Yeah.
Oh, come in.

336
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,073
Oh, hey, Karate Kid.

337
00:17:21,488 --> 00:17:23,032
The Hillary Swank version.

338
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:25,341
Hi, how are you ?

339
00:17:25,557 --> 00:17:27,912
I need to change my emergency
contact information

340
00:17:28,075 --> 00:17:29,291
from Michael Scott.

341
00:17:29,777 --> 00:17:32,493
- Okay, to what ?
- Just put...

342
00:17:33,576 --> 00:17:34,880
The hospital.

343
00:17:35,417 --> 00:17:36,891
Contact number :

344
00:17:37,175 --> 00:17:38,282
Just put 911.

345
00:17:39,777 --> 00:17:41,871
He is such a sore loser.

346
00:17:42,076 --> 00:17:43,732
You heard obviously,

347
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,451
that I mopped the floor
with him this afternoon.

348
00:17:47,986 --> 00:17:51,543
You know what, do yourself a favor.
Just leave me as his contact.

349
00:17:51,807 --> 00:17:54,843
And I will call the hospital.
Cut out the middleman.

350
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:07,160
- Later Jim.
- Later Kev.

351
00:18:14,137 --> 00:18:16,320
- Have a good weekend.
- Yeah, you too.

352
00:18:28,818 --> 00:18:29,842
Yeah.

353
00:18:30,007 --> 00:18:31,460
I have the emergency contacts.

354
00:18:31,587 --> 00:18:34,031
Just lay 'em on the chair.
I'll take it from here.

355
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:36,982
So what you up to this weekend ?

356
00:18:38,588 --> 00:18:40,282
Hanging out with some
friends probably.

357
00:18:40,317 --> 00:18:42,321
Well, if you do anything crazy,
give me a shout.

358
00:18:42,345 --> 00:18:44,340
Yeah. Alright, I will, 
see you Monday.

359
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:46,590
Alright. Bye.

360
00:18:55,326 --> 00:18:57,702
- Dwight ?
- Michael, did you finish yet ?

361
00:18:57,907 --> 00:19:00,230
This close. Dwight, may I speak
with you for a minute.

362
00:19:00,277 --> 00:19:01,292
I'm busy.

363
00:19:01,325 --> 00:19:03,152
Well, busier.
But I'm making the time.

364
00:19:03,216 --> 00:19:05,432
Michael, can't your conversation
wait till Monday ?

365
00:19:05,537 --> 00:19:06,823
- We want to go home.
- Well,

366
00:19:06,927 --> 00:19:09,190
You  don't even have anybody
to go home to, Toby. So...

367
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,213
The shipping place closes
in a half hour.

368
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,261
I know.

369
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:15,443
But I've been carrying the
load on my back all day.

370
00:19:15,576 --> 00:19:18,471
And if everyone would
just chip in a little bit,

371
00:19:19,407 --> 00:19:21,011
might help me out.

372
00:19:21,237 --> 00:19:22,263
What do you say ?

373
00:19:22,398 --> 00:19:24,063
Let's gang bang this thing
and go home.

374
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,143
Good.

375
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,320
- This is illegal.
- I don't care.

376
00:19:38,788 --> 00:19:41,212
I have been testing you
the entire day.

377
00:19:41,317 --> 00:19:42,921
Did you know that ?

378
00:19:44,597 --> 00:19:46,191
Of course.

379
00:19:46,246 --> 00:19:48,342
And I'm happy to say that you passed.

380
00:19:49,217 --> 00:19:51,452
So, effective immediately,
I am promoting you,

381
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:54,062
from assistant
to the regional manager

382
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,923
to assistant regional manager.

383
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:00,931
Michael...

384
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,550
I don't know.
I, I know. I know. I know.

385
00:20:03,848 --> 00:20:07,033
I know. I wouldn't be offering it if
I didn't think you could handle it.

386
00:20:07,138 --> 00:20:10,050
- I can handle it, I can.
- I know. Okay.

387
00:20:12,897 --> 00:20:16,011
So I guess this'll just by my office.

388
00:20:16,097 --> 00:20:18,733
No. No. Title change only.

389
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:21,201
- I'll have Pam send out a memo.
- No, nope.

390
00:20:21,275 --> 00:20:22,631
Three month probationary period.

391
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:25,663
Let's just not tell anybody
about this right now.

392
00:20:25,748 --> 00:20:27,391
- Just a formality ?
- Absolutely.

393
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:28,931
But not really.

394
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:30,483
Michael.

395
00:20:34,216 --> 00:20:38,192
I have so much, to learn, from you.

396
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,861
Yes you do.

397
00:20:43,156 --> 00:20:44,662
Thank you.

398
00:20:46,247 --> 00:20:47,361
Sensei.

399
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:52,383
And, Ditto.

400
00:20:54,048 --> 00:20:57,000
I told Dwight that there
is honor in losing.

401
00:20:57,265 --> 00:20:59,413
Which as we all know is
completely ridiculous.

402
00:20:59,496 --> 00:21:03,560
But, there is, however, honor in
making a loser feel better.

403
00:21:03,825 --> 00:21:05,602
Which is what I just did
for Dwight.

404
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,661
Would I rather be feared or loved ?

405
00:21:10,405 --> 00:21:15,170
Easy. Both. I want people to be
afraid of how much they love me.

406
00:21:15,727 --> 00:21:18,492
And I think I proved
that today at the dojo.

407
00:21:18,665 --> 00:21:21,493
- Typewriter torture.
- Sensei help !

408
00:21:21,597 --> 00:21:23,541
- No.
- Typewriter !



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

1
00:00:00,586 --> 00:00:02,905
Hey. Any luck with that big meeting yet ?

2
00:00:02,952 --> 00:00:04,850
I've got Michael's lucky tie.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,981
No, they're in the conference room.

4
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:09,512
- Okay.
- Wait, are those Michael's Levis ?

5
00:00:09,652 --> 00:00:11,854
Yeah, who dry-cleans jeans ?

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,010
Michael and his jeans.

7
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:15,620
He gets in them and....

8
00:00:15,667 --> 00:00:17,611
I'm not exactly sure what happens.

9
00:00:17,729 --> 00:00:18,689
But...

10
00:00:18,716 --> 00:00:22,110
I can tell you, he loves the
way he looks in those jeans.

11
00:00:22,903 --> 00:00:25,106
I know that's why he
started casual Fridays.

12
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:26,950
I'll take those.

13
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:28,526
Thanks.

14
00:00:58,779 --> 00:01:00,281
Episode 7 - season 2
" The client"

15
00:01:00,387 --> 00:01:01,943
Synchro: Occeane 
Transcript : Nikki (twiztv.com)


16
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,720
http://pmag.f2o.org/theofficeus

17
00:01:06,637 --> 00:01:09,571
This is a projection of
the county's needs.

18
00:01:10,575 --> 00:01:12,620
Graphs and charts

19
00:01:12,727 --> 00:01:14,863
Somebody's been really
doing their homework.

20
00:01:14,918 --> 00:01:17,292
- Looks like USA Today.
- 13 schools,

21
00:01:17,887 --> 00:01:19,161
2 hospitals...

22
00:01:19,256 --> 00:01:20,983
<i>So this possible client
they're talking about</i>

23
00:01:21,055 --> 00:01:22,163
Actually a big deal.

24
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:23,480
It's Lackawanna County.

25
00:01:23,556 --> 00:01:25,302
Our whole county.

26
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:29,193
And if we get this, they might
not have to downsize our branch.

27
00:01:30,555 --> 00:01:32,631
And I could work here for years.

28
00:01:33,987 --> 00:01:35,683
And years...

29
00:01:37,525 --> 00:01:38,752
Years.

30
00:01:39,007 --> 00:01:41,131
So, when we get to
the Radisson, I'd like to

31
00:01:41,206 --> 00:01:42,952
I changed it to Chili's.

32
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:44,771
Excuse me ?

33
00:01:45,036 --> 00:01:47,452
Radisson just gives out this vibe.

34
00:01:47,635 --> 00:01:49,353
It's like,
"Oh, I'm doing business at the Radisson."

35
00:01:49,437 --> 00:01:51,483
It's kinda snooty, so...

36
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:53,063
You had no right to do that, Michael.

37
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:56,463
Here's the thing, Chili's
is the new golf course.

38
00:01:57,055 --> 00:01:58,633
It's where business happens.

39
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:01,190
Small Businessman Magazine.

40
00:02:01,707 --> 00:02:03,113
It said that.

41
00:02:03,265 --> 00:02:05,510
It will. I sent it in.
Letter to the editor.

42
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:08,043
Alright.

43
00:02:08,205 --> 00:02:10,531
But you will let me run this meeting.

44
00:02:12,587 --> 00:02:14,003
- Powertrip.
- What ?

45
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,793
She had done a background check on me.

46
00:02:16,938 --> 00:02:18,573
She had it printed out,

47
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:19,021
Yeah.

48
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:22,531
And she was asking me about stuff line
by line while we were having dinner.

49
00:02:23,467 --> 00:02:26,240
- What's going on ?
- We are doing worst first dates.

50
00:02:26,816 --> 00:02:28,340
Oh my God. I win.

51
00:02:28,587 --> 00:02:29,373
Okay.

52
00:02:29,435 --> 00:02:32,193
it was a minor league hockey game.
He brought his brother.

53
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:34,913
And when I went to the bathroom,
the game ended,

54
00:02:34,986 --> 00:02:36,910
- And they forgot about me.
- Okay, that's a joke.

55
00:02:37,137 --> 00:02:38,861
No, they had to come back for me.

56
00:02:39,428 --> 00:02:41,130
Wait, when was this ?

57
00:02:44,466 --> 00:02:46,680
It was, not that long ago.

58
00:02:46,838 --> 00:02:49,912
Wait, not Roy.
Say it's not your fiancй

59
00:02:52,885 --> 00:02:53,712
I always knew...

60
00:02:53,735 --> 00:02:56,261
Pam has refused to go to
sports games with Roy.

61
00:02:57,068 --> 00:02:58,860
But, I never knew why.

62
00:03:00,396 --> 00:03:01,570
Interesting.

63
00:03:02,245 --> 00:03:04,083
Okay, let's do this thing.

64
00:03:04,297 --> 00:03:06,243
- Wish us luck.
- Good luck Michael,

65
00:03:06,406 --> 00:03:07,630
- Good luck Jan.
- Thank you.

66
00:03:07,737 --> 00:03:09,361
Kiss ass. Okay !

67
00:03:09,486 --> 00:03:12,363
Probably going to go late tonight,
burning the midnight tequila.

68
00:03:13,135 --> 00:03:13,880
So,

69
00:03:14,015 --> 00:03:15,841
I think you all could, just take off now.

70
00:03:15,886 --> 00:03:17,891
Michael, this shouldn't take
more than an hour.

71
00:03:17,967 --> 00:03:18,403
Well...

72
00:03:18,467 --> 00:03:21,113
Do you always shut down the entire
office when you leave for an hour ?

73
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,021
No, no, that would not be efficient.

74
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:27,741
Actually,  they just don't get very
much work done when I'm not here.

75
00:03:29,965 --> 00:03:30,781
That's not true.

76
00:03:31,015 --> 00:03:32,611
I know how to delegate.

77
00:03:32,787 --> 00:03:35,093
And they do more work when I'm not here.

78
00:03:35,688 --> 00:03:37,212
Not more...

79
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:39,043
The same amount of work...

80
00:03:39,115 --> 00:03:40,943
Is done whether I am here or not.

81
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,221
HEY EVERYBODY LISTEN UP !

82
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:45,450
This is what we're gonna do.

83
00:03:45,616 --> 00:03:48,333
You sit tight untill I
return, sound good ?

84
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:51,120
Doesn't matter.
It's an order.

85
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:52,953
Follow it blindly.

86
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,431
Okay ?

87
00:03:55,596 --> 00:03:57,030
Alright, ciao.

88
00:03:57,206 --> 00:03:58,600
Adios !

89
00:03:59,738 --> 00:04:02,312
- So which way is Chili's ?
- I'll drive.

90
00:04:02,548 --> 00:04:04,300
No, that's alright.
I want to leave straight from there.

91
00:04:04,405 --> 00:04:06,201
It's just a couple blocks away. So..

92
00:04:06,298 --> 00:04:07,720
Boy, you really don't
know Scranton, do you ?

93
00:04:07,857 --> 00:04:09,133
- I know Scranton.
- At all.

94
00:04:09,257 --> 00:04:10,951
- Alright.
- Have you ever been to Scranton, Jan ?

95
00:04:11,116 --> 00:04:13,070
it's just a couple blocks away
we can go together.

96
00:04:13,535 --> 00:04:15,822
<i>Jan Levinson-Gould.</i>

97
00:04:15,947 --> 00:04:17,371
<i>Jan is cold.</i>

98
00:04:17,405 --> 00:04:19,331
If she was sitting across
from you on a train,

99
00:04:19,368 --> 00:04:21,450
and she wasn't moving,
you might think she was dead.

100
00:04:22,607 --> 00:04:24,480
We should come up with
a signal of some sort.

101
00:04:25,425 --> 00:04:27,932
Why would we need a signal ?
Well, in case one of us gets into trouble.

102
00:04:28,008 --> 00:04:29,570
The other one can signal...

103
00:04:29,595 --> 00:04:31,490
What kind of trouble are you
planning on getting in Michael ?

104
00:04:31,587 --> 00:04:33,343
Well, I, it could be either of us.

105
00:04:33,517 --> 00:04:36,323
You're going to let me do the talking,
we agreed on that.

106
00:04:36,455 --> 00:04:37,993
Yes !

107
00:04:41,395 --> 00:04:43,032
Hello ? Christian ?

108
00:04:43,156 --> 00:04:44,492
- Yes.
- I thought that was you. Hi.

109
00:04:44,955 --> 00:04:46,880
Michael Scott, this is
Jan Levinson-Gould.

110
00:04:47,077 --> 00:04:48,861
-  Just Jan Levinson.
- No Gould ?

111
00:04:48,938 --> 00:04:49,583
No.

112
00:04:49,685 --> 00:04:51,602
Thank you very much for meeting with us.

113
00:04:51,707 --> 00:04:53,430
- Have you been waiting long ?
- No, not long.

114
00:04:53,595 --> 00:04:55,221
- Good.
- Jan, what happened ?

115
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,710
- Michael.
- Is Gould dead ? What...

116
00:04:58,038 --> 00:05:00,251
Michael. We got divorced, okay ?

117
00:05:00,415 --> 00:05:02,271
- I'm so sorry, excuse me.
- Wow, you're kidding me

118
00:05:02,438 --> 00:05:04,203
- Do you wanna talk about it ?
- Michael.

119
00:05:04,328 --> 00:05:06,711
- Could we have a table for three please ?
- When did this happen ?

120
00:05:07,426 --> 00:05:09,250
- We're in a meeting.
- Okay.
<i> This way please</i>

121
00:05:09,286 --> 00:05:10,961
- Christian...
- Alright, after you

122
00:05:11,425 --> 00:05:12,820
Thank you

123
00:05:16,755 --> 00:05:19,761
I thought we could start by going
over the needs of the county.

124
00:05:20,016 --> 00:05:20,960
Right.

125
00:05:21,256 --> 00:05:23,343
Well, Lackawanna County
has not been immune,

126
00:05:23,527 --> 00:05:27,021
to the slow economic growth 
over the past five years.

127
00:05:27,348 --> 00:05:30,841
So for us, the name of the
game is budget reduction.

128
00:05:31,036 --> 00:05:33,413
- Awesome Blossom ?
- What ?

129
00:05:34,095 --> 00:05:35,292
I think we should share
and Awesome Blossom.

130
00:05:35,315 --> 00:05:36,833
What do you say ? They are awsome.

131
00:05:36,945 --> 00:05:38,521
You want to, Christian ? Awesome ?

132
00:05:38,636 --> 00:05:40,990
- Sure.
- Okay, it's done.

133
00:05:41,088 --> 00:05:42,590
Actually, Megan !

134
00:05:42,655 --> 00:05:44,830
May we have an Awesome Blossom, please ?
Extra  Awsome ?

135
00:05:45,098 --> 00:05:46,231
Not it's done.

136
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:49,661
-  So, if you have a...
- Hey, I heard a very, very, funny joke...

137
00:05:49,986 --> 00:05:51,911
- You wanna hear it ?
- Christian...

138
00:05:52,275 --> 00:05:54,010
You don't have to listen to this.

139
00:05:54,405 --> 00:05:56,283
- It's okay, I like jokes.
- Okay.

140
00:05:56,447 --> 00:05:59,420
- Just the one.
- Just one joke ? Okay.

141
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:04,601
Well, if it's just gonna be one...
I, will think of a different joke.

142
00:06:06,286 --> 00:06:08,381
Let's see.

143
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,080
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.

144
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,636
<i>Pam, it's Michael. I need you to go into
my office and check some data for me.</i>

145
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:15,300
Okay,

146
00:06:15,906 --> 00:06:17,836
- You want me to read 'em ?
- Yes

147
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:22,530
Okay, um, a fisherman is walking down 5
th Avenue leading an animal behind him.

148
00:06:22,797 --> 00:06:25,372
No! Nope. Told it. Not as good
as you think. Pick another one.

149
00:06:25,445 --> 00:06:26,321
Okay.

150
00:06:26,437 --> 00:06:28,581
There's a transcript
between a Naval ship.

151
00:06:30,287 --> 00:06:31,823
Bingo! And a lighthouse.

152
00:06:31,927 --> 00:06:34,441
Yes, that is hysterical. Could you
start that one from the beginning ?

153
00:06:34,997 --> 00:06:37,990
<i>Sure, there's a transcript between
a Naval ship and a lighthouse.</i>

154
00:06:57,398 --> 00:06:59,423
Is this real ?
It is a screenplay...

155
00:07:00,658 --> 00:07:01,863
Starring himself.

156
00:07:02,448 --> 00:07:04,011
Agent Michael Scarn.

157
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:05,450
Of the F.B.I.

158
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:06,933
How long is this ?

159
00:07:07,288 --> 00:07:09,333
Pam, good work.

160
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:11,880
Wait, stop.

161
00:07:13,468 --> 00:07:14,731
- Drawings.
- What is that?

162
00:07:15,025 --> 00:07:16,551
Those are drawings in case,

163
00:07:17,368 --> 00:07:20,193
the writing didn't really,
put a picture in your head.

164
00:07:20,328 --> 00:07:23,312
And there he is, in the flesh,
Agent Michael Scarn

165
00:07:23,886 --> 00:07:25,562
Now we know what he looks like.

166
00:07:25,795 --> 00:07:29,800
First guy says, "Well, I'm
an astronaut, so I drive a Saturn."

167
00:07:29,956 --> 00:07:31,181
And the second guy says,

168
00:07:31,246 --> 00:07:34,520
"Well, I am a pimp, so I
drive a cheap Escort."

169
00:07:35,158 --> 00:07:36,200
And the third guy says,

170
00:07:36,306 --> 00:07:41,090
"I got you both beat, I'm a proctologist,
so I drive a brown Probe."

171
00:07:45,438 --> 00:07:47,540
Oh, no! Oh my God, that's funny! I

172
00:07:48,257 --> 00:07:50,882
almost had Awesome Blossom
coming out of my nose!

173
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,580
"S'il vous plaоt," could I have
a vodka tonic, please?

174
00:07:54,825 --> 00:07:58,333
Do we all have our copy of "Threat
Level Midnight" by Michael Scott ?

175
00:07:58,498 --> 00:07:59,733
Yeah.

176
00:07:59,905 --> 00:08:00,711
Alright.

177
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:04,320
Let's get this started. I'm gonna be
reading the action descriptions

178
00:08:04,995 --> 00:08:08,023
And Phyllis, I would like you to
play Catherine Zeta-Jones.

179
00:08:08,098 --> 00:08:10,563
- That's the character's name?
- You guys  should not doing this/

180
00:08:11,355 --> 00:08:13,270
Why not Dwight? This is a movie.

181
00:08:13,358 --> 00:08:15,951
I mean this is for all of
America to enjoy.

182
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:18,242
You took something that
doesn't belong to you.

183
00:08:18,407 --> 00:08:20,931
- Dwight. do you want to...
- Brought it in here, made copies of it...

184
00:08:21,058 --> 00:08:23,920
The lead role of Agent Michael Scarn ?

185
00:08:27,737 --> 00:08:30,550
That's delicious! I love it.

186
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,522
We would probably be upset with ourselves

187
00:08:33,648 --> 00:08:36,143
if we went this whole night
without talking business.

188
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:39,092
So, Dunder Mifflin can provide,

189
00:08:39,197 --> 00:08:41,560
a level of personal
service to the county,

190
00:08:41,808 --> 00:08:44,042
that the warehouse chains
just can't match.

191
00:08:44,176 --> 00:08:47,063
- Well, we are out to save money.
- What's the bottom line?

192
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,670
Blah! Blah blah blah. Blu bad be bah.

193
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,532
That's why I wanted a signal.

194
00:08:53,035 --> 00:08:53,781
Between us.

195
00:08:53,847 --> 00:08:54,612
So,

196
00:08:54,788 --> 00:08:57,352
I wouldn't have to just shout
nonsense words. That's her fault.

197
00:08:58,376 --> 00:09:01,441
Did somebody say babyback ribs ?

198
00:09:04,527 --> 00:09:07,183
I don't think Christian has time for that.

199
00:09:07,328 --> 00:09:08,642
- Michael.
- I have time.

200
00:09:09,496 --> 00:09:13,460
I want my babyback, babyback, babyback...

201
00:09:14,685 --> 00:09:17,841
Chili's babyback ribs..

202
00:09:18,097 --> 00:09:21,651
Inside the F.B.I., Agent Michael Scarn
sits with his feet up on his desk

203
00:09:21,846 --> 00:09:23,922
Catherine Zeta-Jones enters.

204
00:09:24,257 --> 00:09:26,653
- Sir, you have some messages.
- Not now !

205
00:09:26,688 --> 00:09:27,863
They're important.

206
00:09:27,936 --> 00:09:29,673
Okay, what are they ?

207
00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:32,370
The first message is "I love you."

208
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:34,081
That's from me.

209
00:09:34,146 --> 00:09:36,550
Not in a thousand years, Catherine.
We work together.

210
00:09:36,645 --> 00:09:38,232
And get off my desk.

211
00:09:38,357 --> 00:09:39,710
Yes, I have acted before.

212
00:09:39,887 --> 00:09:42,333
I was in a production of Oklahoma !
in the seventh grade.

213
00:09:42,775 --> 00:09:45,471
I played the part of Mutie the mailman.

214
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:49,291
They had too many kids, so they
made up roles like that.

215
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:51,711
And I was good.

216
00:09:52,177 --> 00:09:53,641
If it isn't my old partner.

217
00:09:53,787 --> 00:09:55,603
Samuel L. Chang.

218
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:59,583
Agent Michael Scarn, you
lost some weight.

219
00:09:59,978 --> 00:10:02,090
Thank you for noticing.

220
00:10:02,356 --> 00:10:04,702
Now, keep me company fo
r one more mission.

221
00:10:04,828 --> 00:10:07,371
Hey, I have to work late.

222
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,940
You're joking, right?

223
00:10:10,066 --> 00:10:11,771
Agent Michael Scarn takes
out a nine millimeter gun

224
00:10:11,846 --> 00:10:14,683
And shoots the cake to bits.

225
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,792
Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny.

226
00:10:19,117 --> 00:10:20,003
Word.

227
00:10:20,225 --> 00:10:21,621
Michael's movie ?

228
00:10:21,758 --> 00:10:23,850
Two thumbs down!

229
00:10:31,177 --> 00:10:35,421
A man sitting several seats down who
has a gold face turns to Michael Scarn.

230
00:10:37,287 --> 00:10:39,361
Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface?

231
00:10:40,755 --> 00:10:41,802
Mr. Scarn !

232
00:10:41,838 --> 00:10:44,310
perhaps you would be more
comfortable in my private jet.

233
00:10:44,457 --> 00:10:48,142
Yes, perhaps I would Goldenface.
Sam, get my luggage.

234
00:10:48,225 --> 00:10:49,863
I  forget it, brotha.

235
00:10:50,186 --> 00:10:53,320
Samuel, you are such and idiot !
You are the worst assistant ever.

236
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,673
And you're disgusting Dwigt.

237
00:10:55,866 --> 00:10:57,822
Wait, who's Dwigt ?

238
00:10:58,307 --> 00:10:59,611
Here's what we think happened.

239
00:10:59,907 --> 00:11:03,693
Michael's sidekick, who all through
the movie is this complete idiot,

240
00:11:03,785 --> 00:11:08,401
who's causing the downfall of the United
States, was originally named Dwight.

241
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:13,372
But then Michael changed it to Samuel L.
Chang using a search and replace.

242
00:11:13,638 --> 00:11:15,850
But that doesn't work on
misspelled words.

243
00:11:16,018 --> 00:11:18,721
Leaving behind one, Dwigt.

244
00:11:18,956 --> 00:11:21,072
And Dwight figured it out.

245
00:11:21,238 --> 00:11:22,312
Oops.

246
00:11:22,438 --> 00:11:25,440
D-W-I-G-H-T

247
00:11:25,826 --> 00:11:29,061
Okay, you know what ?
I am done with this. That's it, the end.

248
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,942
Well, some of us wanna
keep reading, so...

249
00:11:32,015 --> 00:11:33,563
You don't speak for everyone, Jim.

250
00:11:33,756 --> 00:11:37,212
Okay, announcement.
My uncle bought me some fireworks.

251
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:41,421
And anyone who wants to see a real show,
come with me outside now.

252
00:11:42,455 --> 00:11:45,200
That's actually a good idea,
we'll all take a brief intermission.

253
00:11:45,586 --> 00:11:46,861
Hey, are you hungry?

254
00:11:47,058 --> 00:11:48,492
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

255
00:11:48,845 --> 00:11:51,663
And so after watching my mom
go through so much pain,

256
00:11:51,987 --> 00:11:54,070
I decided to keep that promise,

257
00:11:54,358 --> 00:11:56,612
that I made to her and take care of her.

258
00:11:58,188 --> 00:12:00,790
This brings us to Jan. Truth or dare ?

259
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:04,052
- Tell us about your divorce.
- Oh, no, Michael. Michael, Michael.

260
00:12:04,246 --> 00:12:06,462
- Ooh, right ?
- Michael please, no.

261
00:12:06,988 --> 00:12:09,143
Hey. So you're not gonna play.
She's not playing.

262
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:10,422
She's not playing the game.

263
00:12:10,466 --> 00:12:11,662
- We've been fighting for a while,
- That's not fair.

264
00:12:11,718 --> 00:12:13,670
he didn't want kids.
I knew that going into it.

265
00:12:13,777 --> 00:12:17,242
But he also knew that I did. So I guess
I thought that he would change his mind.

266
00:12:17,538 --> 00:12:19,270
He thought that I would change mine.

267
00:12:19,685 --> 00:12:20,750
You didn't.

268
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:22,103
I was stupid.

269
00:12:22,347 --> 00:12:23,972
No. No.

270
00:12:24,127 --> 00:12:25,612
You were not stupid.

271
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:28,841
- Gould was stupid, right ?
- That's right.

272
00:12:29,247 --> 00:12:31,561
You know, you were really brave.

273
00:12:32,027 --> 00:12:34,191
I mean, you, you put your arms
out there, you slit your wrists.

274
00:12:34,357 --> 00:12:35,273
It's true. Yous said :

275
00:12:35,336 --> 00:12:37,570
"World, this is my blood, it's red."

276
00:12:37,628 --> 00:12:40,012
"Just like yours, so love me."

277
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:43,851
I had plans to meet a friend tonight.

278
00:12:44,095 --> 00:12:45,752
<i>Which I had to cancel.</i>

279
00:12:45,927 --> 00:12:47,343
But this is cool too.

280
00:12:47,855 --> 00:12:49,463
I'm not a complainer.

281
00:12:54,146 --> 00:12:54,663
Wow. 

282
00:12:55,285 --> 00:12:56,481
For the bugs.

283
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:57,773
Nice.

284
00:12:57,887 --> 00:13:00,521
That's excellent because bugs love..

285
00:13:01,588 --> 00:13:02,943
My famous grilled cheese sandwich.

286
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:04,013
Yes !

287
00:13:04,807 --> 00:13:05,731
Nice.

288
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,702
I can't remember the last time
someone made me dinner.

289
00:13:23,497 --> 00:13:25,022
Right down the street ?

290
00:13:25,588 --> 00:13:27,223
Kenneth  Road, born and raised.

291
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:30,083
Spent my whole life right
here in Lackawanna County

292
00:13:30,196 --> 00:13:32,010
And I do not intend on moving.

293
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,902
I know this place. I know how
many hospitals we have.

294
00:13:36,905 --> 00:13:39,432
how many schools we have.
It's home, you know?

295
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:43,311
I know the challenges that
this county's up against.

296
00:13:43,408 --> 00:13:45,900
Here's the thing about those discount
suppliers, they don't care.

297
00:13:46,007 --> 00:13:48,680
They come in, they undercut everything.

298
00:13:48,817 --> 00:13:50,603
And they run us out of business.

299
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:53,771
And then, once we're all gone,
they jack up the prices.

300
00:13:53,885 --> 00:13:54,822
- I know.
- It's bad.

301
00:13:54,845 --> 00:13:57,192
- It's terrible.
- It is, you know what ? It really is.

302
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,622
I don't know.

303
00:14:01,397 --> 00:14:03,071
I guess I could give you
guys our business but,

304
00:14:03,697 --> 00:14:05,491
you have to meet me halfway, okay ?

305
00:14:05,635 --> 00:14:07,583
Because they're expecting
me to make cuts.

306
00:14:09,597 --> 00:14:12,753
Well, corporate's gonna go ballistic,
but, you think we could, Jan?

307
00:14:16,298 --> 00:14:19,111
So, I guess I'll see you in..

308
00:14:20,158 --> 00:14:21,130
10 hours.

309
00:14:21,216 --> 00:14:23,070
What are you going
to do with your time off?

310
00:14:23,225 --> 00:14:24,520
- Travel.
- Yeah.

311
00:14:24,635 --> 00:14:26,123
I've been looking forward to it.

312
00:14:27,086 --> 00:14:28,592
It's gonna be...

313
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:31,680
really nice. I'm gonna find myself.

314
00:14:32,908 --> 00:14:34,200
You have new music ?

315
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:35,553
Yeah.

316
00:14:36,206 --> 00:14:37,600
Definitely.

317
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:49,410
- See ya !
- Bye !

318
00:14:51,976 --> 00:14:53,262
Thanks.

319
00:14:54,555 --> 00:14:55,762
- Yes !
- We did it.

320
00:14:55,885 --> 00:14:56,973
- We got it !
- We nailed it.

321
00:14:57,016 --> 00:14:58,540
- I mean we got it!
- Come here.

322
00:15:01,327 --> 00:15:02,300
I am really...

323
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,261
...thrilled.

324
00:15:18,647 --> 00:15:20,241
- Let's go.
- What ?

325
00:15:20,536 --> 00:15:21,910
- Let's go.
- Go and, okay.

326
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:24,181
Where are we going ?
Doesn't matter.

327
00:15:24,815 --> 00:15:26,441
Goin' to the go-go

328
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:29,072
Okay.

329
00:15:39,255 --> 00:15:41,150
Michael ?

330
00:15:48,946 --> 00:15:50,212
Michael ?

331
00:15:52,987 --> 00:15:54,590
Michael ?

332
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:03,263
His car's not in the parking lot.

333
00:16:03,557 --> 00:16:05,601
I should check the accident reports.

334
00:16:08,547 --> 00:16:10,003
Who's this ?

335
00:16:10,976 --> 00:16:12,252
Jan?

336
00:16:31,678 --> 00:16:33,072
Morning, Pam.

337
00:16:37,187 --> 00:16:38,481
No, nothing happened.

338
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,712
I swear ! Nothing happened.

339
00:16:44,356 --> 00:16:45,413
What I'm...

340
00:16:46,236 --> 00:16:48,032
totally being serious.

341
00:16:48,787 --> 00:16:51,430
A gentleman does not kiss and tell.

342
00:16:51,688 --> 00:16:54,531
And neither do I.

343
00:16:55,336 --> 00:16:58,512
I'm...seriously, guys, I'm, I'm not,
I don't wanna go into it at all.

344
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,080
t's of limits. (

345
00:17:03,396 --> 00:17:06,881
Fine, I took her back to her hotel,
and we made out for a little while.

346
00:17:07,016 --> 00:17:08,942
It was great. I mean she told
me about her divorce.

347
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:12,432
We talked for about five hours,
she fell asleep on my arm. You know.

348
00:17:18,428 --> 00:17:20,512
- Hello, Dwight.
- Did you do her?

349
00:17:22,028 --> 00:17:24,342
- Who ?
- Jan Levinson-Gould.

350
00:17:24,856 --> 00:17:27,040
No, no...

351
00:17:27,376 --> 00:17:29,412
- No Gould.
- Did you do her ?

352
00:17:29,536 --> 00:17:31,420
This is none of your affair.

353
00:17:31,687 --> 00:17:34,742
- And she is your boss.
- And she is a woman.

354
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,452
She is a strong, soft...

355
00:17:37,785 --> 00:17:40,820
...thoughtful, sexy woman.

356
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,302
And you know what ?
I don't think I can sit here,

357
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,572
And let you talk about her that way,

358
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:49,621
Without me defending her honor. 
Jan, I defend your honor.

359
00:17:50,425 --> 00:17:52,122
Is that all ?

360
00:17:56,395 --> 00:17:58,782
Jan didn't come back for
her car last night.

361
00:17:59,427 --> 00:18:01,023
What ?!

362
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,730
Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn
has finally found his Catherine Zeta ?

363
00:18:04,936 --> 00:18:06,860
Oh, I don't know...

364
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:09,662
Oh, my God !

365
00:18:09,765 --> 00:18:12,801
- This is Jan's cell.
- No way.

366
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,053
Dunder  Mifflin, this is Pam.

367
00:18:15,346 --> 00:18:17,300
I know we have to register,

368
00:18:17,508 --> 00:18:20,382
as a consensual sexual
relationship with HR.

369
00:18:20,716 --> 00:18:23,522
My question, do I do it as the man,

370
00:18:23,628 --> 00:18:26,010
does she do it as my superior ? I

371
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:30,482
I don't know. That leads to other issues
that we may have, in our relationship.

372
00:18:31,347 --> 00:18:33,143
It's...Excuse me

373
00:18:33,867 --> 00:18:37,132
Hello? Hi, just talking about you.

374
00:18:38,008 --> 00:18:39,532
The camera.

375
00:18:39,766 --> 00:18:42,413
No.How's traffic ?

376
00:18:43,025 --> 00:18:44,911
I miss you, what ?

377
00:18:45,665 --> 00:18:47,333
Okay.

378
00:18:48,647 --> 00:18:50,363
Well.

379
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:53,073
if it was a mistake, it was
a wonderful mistake.

380
00:18:55,945 --> 00:18:58,232
No, just...

381
00:18:59,197 --> 00:19:02,991
No, I did not intentionally
get you drunk.

382
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:09,760
No, no. This is just a fight.

383
00:19:09,995 --> 00:19:12,921
This is just a first fight of
many fights we're gonna have.

384
00:19:13,816 --> 00:19:15,702
Right.

385
00:19:15,927 --> 00:19:17,063
No.

386
00:19:17,947 --> 00:19:20,001
You, I don't understand.
You wanna see other people.

387
00:19:20,856 --> 00:19:22,913
Only other people.

388
00:19:23,158 --> 00:19:26,651
I think you're still a little bit drunk.
Excuse me, Excuse me ?

389
00:19:28,516 --> 00:19:30,152
I think you're stil- yes.

390
00:19:30,347 --> 00:19:32,103
Why don't you just come back here?

391
00:19:32,168 --> 00:19:34,451
We can go to the hotel.
Have a few drinks.

392
00:19:34,736 --> 00:19:36,701
No, I didn't slip you something !

393
00:19:37,297 --> 00:19:39,903
Some might even say we
had our first date last night.

394
00:19:40,425 --> 00:19:41,940
- Oh really?
- Really.

395
00:19:42,027 --> 00:19:46,301
- Why might some say that ?
- 'Cause there was dinner, by candelight

396
00:19:47,318 --> 00:19:49,371
Dinner and a show, if you
include Michael's movie.

397
00:19:50,586 --> 00:19:53,580
And there was dancing and fireworks.

398
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:56,092
- Pretty good date..
- We didn't dance

399
00:19:57,435 --> 00:19:59,543
You're right, we didn't dance.
It was more like...

400
00:19:59,778 --> 00:20:01,372
swaying.

401
00:20:01,995 --> 00:20:04,963
- But, still romantic.
- Swaying isn't dancing.

402
00:20:07,526 --> 00:20:11,221
At least I didn't leave you at a
high school hockey game.

403
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:19,282
I have some faxes to get out.

404
00:20:20,217 --> 00:20:22,691
Oh, come on. Pam, I'm...

405
00:20:23,377 --> 00:20:25,560
Okay, we didn't dance.

406
00:20:25,747 --> 00:20:27,702
And I was totally joking, anyway.

407
00:20:28,787 --> 00:20:32,123
it's not really a date if the
girl goes home to her fiancй.

408
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:34,471
Right ?

rio ferdinand has been there and won

this title now with united on two

occasions hoping

to lead them to another but it's all or

nothing for arsenal today

they have to shake off the mental and

physical scars of anfield on tuesday

and produce a performance and a result

well certainly the latter

worthy of champions today to stay in

this race

manchester united can have that very

sweet satisfaction

of eliminating their increasingly bitter

rivals from the race

strengthening their own hand greatly in

the process united know

if they lose chelsea could be topped by

next weekend with two games to come for

them

in midweek

some awesome performances on home tour

for united this season

15 wins out of 17. only manchester city

have come here and won

reading the only side to take a point

aside from that strange to think that

they had a slow start to the campaign

and didn't win any of their first three

premier league games contrast that

with arsenal who won eight of their

first ten

yet it's united who have hit the front

in the home straight

when they are always traditionally the

stronger

something sir alex ferguson has always

put great score on

being ready for this running and they

certainly have been

the mounting goal tally in their last

three home games in the premier league

certainly

confirms that story two three and then

four

but there's a manager who does have the

edge over ferguson

including penalty shootouts he's won 14

to 13

against sir alex not many managers can

claim that degree of success

strong referee needed today howard webb

is that man england's representative

at euro 2008.

it has been a bitter feud at times but

it is always the confrontation by and

large

that tends to define our season runs in

the premier league

let's take a look at today's team news

then and manchester united bring back

something akin to a holy trinity

with ronaldo rooney and scholes

returning to a side who defeated roma on

wednesday without them

patrice evra also comes in at left back

in place of mikhail sylvester

anderson ryan giggs and carlos tevez

among the options available to

sir alex on the bench while gerard tk

retains his place at centre-back

in the manufacture's continued absence

surprises are plenty in the arsenal

lineup notably jens lehmann who starts

in the premier league for the first time

since february

alex song is also a shock inclusion we

think at centre-back

17 months on from his last premier

league start in arsenal colours

the axe falls on philipp sanderos

flamini is injured yarby suspended

the experience gilberto is out of the

wilderness and robin van persie

[Music]

returns

[Applause]

sir alex ferguson getting his prize for

manager of the month

for march it's usually the kiss of death

to be honest

and it may be some encouragement for

arsenal today

cristiano ronaldo also receiving the

player of the month award out there on

the field as well

it can be no disputing that he has been

the defining figure the star

of this season howard webb has to be

strong today fn doesn't he

yes lots of pressure on referees the

spotlight's been on them

all season really as it is i suppose

every season but uh we've got

arguably the best referee in the country

no reason why he should be overall by

the occasion

many refereed many a big match

well jens lehmann i thought he was going

to quietly slip to retirement but he's

in the arsenal 11 today

big surprise wayne rooney will hope to

beat him again

arsene wenger will hope to repeat the

dose last season when

emmanuel adebayo's single goal was

enough to record victory at old trafford

the atmosphere has certainly lifted a

notch once more it's been tingling

all day at old trafford you know what

the stakes are in this game more so for

arsenal

it's their season in one day

ferdinand and william gallas the two

skippers

[Applause]

arsenal know how high the stakes are

today

he's been there and done it he's one of

the few invincibles

still around at arsenal toure kishi and

gilberto

completing the set in the arsenal side

today

alex how will he cope with this test

today

he's played at old trafford before when

he was on loan at charlton last season

that is a major surprise to see him in

the side

so underway arsenal have never won the

league having lost

at old trafford along the way if they do

suffer defeat then they'll certainly be

out of it

we're still condemned to a third

successive season

without silverware really funny koku it

is

all about arsenal today yes it's been

such a massive week for them

i'm sure they knew at the beginning of

the week going to anfield and then

coming to old trafford up

things would very much hinge on these

two performances

but today performances is required

obviously to get something at old

trafford

but the result is the all-important

thing

van persie back in the arsenal lineup

winning an early free-kick

for the gunners first touch for alex

song and that will be hugely welcome for

it

continuing in the right back role which

has been something of a bone of

contention for arsenal supporters

especially with emmanuel

ibuy in the side today as he was at

anfield in midwich

i just wonder as well the appearance of

jens lehmann andrew bertos silver as

well in midfield whether that's a slight

admission of guilt

from uh from arsene wenger and maybe he

wishes he played a more

more experienced team in the recent

weeks they would have stopped

hemorrhaging points and dropped points

two points

on more than one occasion that's led to

the slip in the table coming from blv

first but now in third place

he never admitted though voted publicly

anyway i wouldn't have thought so

hello pk was excellent

on loan at rails zaragosa last season

the spaniard

and pitched into what is almost

certainly the biggest game

of his career so far

rooney rising but slightly misjudging it

spurred away the vaio with the first

aerial confrontation with rio ferdinand

pk he has experience of the champions

league this season of course on

wednesday night he

started the game he's also got a couple

of goals in europe's elite competition

this season so he's no

stranger to the big occasion this is

robin van persie

was top scorer last season but has found

it so difficult to get a consistent run

together with the

injury problems he suffered this is

[Applause]

arsenal hoping to cliche the first

meaningful attack of the game

[Applause]

trying to pick their way through it's

all very patient

and wes brown almost caught sleeping

oh we all accuse arsenal of overplaying

on occasion as brown was uh sleeping

there

unlucky not to be caught although he's

not the injured himself

seems to be running freely but an

opportunity to whip the ball and gail

cliche decided not to

just mention van persie he's been the

biggest miss for them this season

his goals and his influence his

creativity technically he's one of the

most gifted players in the league i

don't think anybody would argue with

that

that's been a massive blow for them but

other key players as we know have been

missing virtually all season as well

as it has even led to a little message

of sympathy from sir alex ferguson in

his programme notes today admitting it

was bound to be difficult for arsenal

with all the problems they've suffered

very magnanimous of him this is park you

can afford to be when you're top of the

table

absolutely park always an effervescent

presence in this

united side but he's giving it away and

this is

and percy misjudging it that's it

we shall set fabregas get on the ball

for the first time and united will be

sure to

try and close him down very quickly at

every opportunity to

stop him affecting proceedings because

we know although

he's not been quite the force he was you

can certainly affect things

and also players have been guilty of

giving the ball away cheaply in the

opening minutes

well here is fabregas first chance to

influence things and an optimistic

effort

and the first teams very well they were

watering it before kickoff as well

all groundsmen were in their spot

repairs after the warm-up

seems slightly longer as well

smooth as both teams i'm sure would like

to see it

there's a surface that's taking some

stick down the years here at old

trafford

remember that uh it's alex in his

earlier days when he was still playing

old alex um

moral explained loss of the title to

leeds united on the

state of the pitch in his failure to

sign mick harford before the end of the

season to counteract it with his

aerial presence since then sir alex has

racked up nine

titles he wasn't thanking the pitch for

that

and they do play wonderful stuff it's

definitely the two best footballing

sites in the country and

[Applause]

certainly those amongst the best in

europe as well certainly the most

pleasing on the eye to watch but chelsea

would argue with that but football's all

about productivity

and if after three four seasons you've

not won a major trophy then

you can't really uh just evaluate claims

to be arguably the best team in the

country because there's nothing in the

cupboard

that's certainly true this is adebayor

chance for him to rampage at the united

defense

huge amount of ground it falls for

fabregas

first meaningful effort comes from

arsenal and they'll want more of that

well they give the ball away cheaply to

begin with where's brown's a lucky boy

adeboye runs into trouble in the end but

what's where's brown doing

decipher to a perfect pass to seth

rodriguez and unfortunately for him i

most don't like him as well his first

touch is just a little bit sloppy

takes him wide and he's on the rise

leaning back and stretching

he doesn't trouble the goalkeeper

fabregas presented with a gift

but arsenal couldn't exploit it

fabregas in possession again he's seeing

a fair amount of the ball

adebayor now van persie

making a little run for him but he'll

use gilberto

captain of the side for so long last

season in henry's absence

that's really has struggled to hold down

a place in

arsene wenger's first choice team this

season his experience will be welcome

today

i know hindsight's a wonderful thing

isn't it but what a lot of people have

been calling out for his

introduction or reintroduction back into

the squad in the last few months really

not only in recent weeks when things

have really

nosedived for arsenal just had extra

composure flaming as good as a player as

he is

so just brings a little bit more calm to

the arsenal team particularly in front

of the back four where they have been

exposed

oldest outfield player these days at

arsenal

this is trying to make progress skulls

haven't really seen him

get into the game as yet arsenal have

asserted themselves quite well in these

early stages could all change in the

blink of an eye especially when ronaldo

gets on the ball but

involved in the first confrontation with

him

[Applause]

well they've been in control of the

midfield so far arsenal playing a usual

formation five across the midlander bio

up front on his own and occasionally

he's isolated who also wasted password

van persie

no other options really probably didn't

commit to the run

and it's so hard to outplay them in that

central midfield area

and that's why i was surprised with the

omission of anderson today but with his

uh slightly more

a lot more combative nature than both

michael carrick and paul scolds

we've seen uh less of a need to foul as

well and postcode does give away a lot

of free kicks

united will be hoping that they don't i

don't need if they'll be over running

midfield

certainly a farce will really get ahead

of steam up and dominate that midfield

area

difficult uh afternoon for the champions

manchester united are the champions

arsenal

looked as though they would be able to

wrestle that crown away

when they were five points clear as

recently as the end of february but what

an alarming collapse it has been for the

gunners

many pointing the finger at wenger and

his failure to spend money in the

transfer window in january and add to

his squad

[Applause]

wayne rooney at the moment is a central

striker for united it wouldn't surprise

me to see cristiano ronaldo occupying

that position

even in this first half and rooney to uh

move either side of him and park they

can alternate either wing

any possibilities for rotation there

this is scholars

they're almost able to steal possession

back for arsenal there

this is gerard pique

[Applause]

that is something of a test for some

unfamiliar characters at the center of

both defenses today

the united back line that has come under

more stress so far

in the opening nine minutes this is

hoping to win an eighth premier league

title this season

aubrey is making another penetrating run

from midfield but he couldn't be found

a blow from rio ferdinand thought maybe

adeboye got himself into position

and then he just overran the ball

into a shoulder rio ferdinand out the

way

this is ronaldo first chance to run at

arsenal

and was it hand ball certainly the free

kick has been given against gilberto

well you want to ground early gilberto

i don't think it's an outstretched hand

but

well it is the decision

the upper arm from the brazilian you

know what this

sort of position could mean

jens lehmann may well get his first test

here if he can actually

get anywhere near it

i know you don't really want to invite

more trouble into your box but

i'll be wise just to put somebody on the

opposing post

actually just a little bit more

difficult for ronaldo

as i said it takes a good view away from

the goalkeeper

as well as the rugby kicker kickers step

away from the ball there

it is ronaldo to strike and the

defensive wall does its duty

[Applause]

that's a succession of free kicks now

second in

a few moments manchester united

beginning to mount some pressure

there's a needless free kick oh howard

webb is he gonna book out to buy up

he's giving him a final warning there

wasn't too much contact there either

there really was no need to touch him

he's going away from goal

to play shepherding him away and arsenal

got pace in their ranks particularly in

their back

you shouldn't really be too frightened

by ronaldo's plays today

he scolds carrick brown ferdinand and tk

in the area waiting here for manchester

united

[Applause]

wrong direction is time for the

portuguese start

who goes behind everybody maria further

i'm just trying to close the back door

for once he's got it wrong for once we

see a human side

he's closing in on the 40 mark

incredibly

in terms of goals this season

third and hand across to halt

the probing run from van persie this is

patrice evra

a lovely touch from ronaldo never really

is carrying the fight here

trying to feed rooney an upgrade defend

from adebayo he's in that position he's

got to follow

the left back

fabregas they could be in here it's

about

clever arriving as well crucial block

there by rio ferdinand

oh what a great block it was maybe

that's why i didn't go forward

it was the extra body in the middle when

fabregas turned it on to him the brewery

the lovely first time ball

and he's just with the outside of their

boots either by i think he was certainly

gold bound

and they found the soldier had that he

might have gone over the big dutchman

great block from the center half and it

seems the blue touch paper has been lit

[Applause]

it's behind by brown there's a good

corner galax came too late

what a chance that was for our duval he

just done with us well before he made

contact

if not i think he would look to have

taken that with his left foot and just

side footed back across the goalkeeper

[Music]

arsenal attacking the stratford end

[Music]

hoping for some reward for their efforts

so far

howard webb unhappy about

both scholes and parker

fabregas to deliver to comes

and it hit song and it was a huge escape

from manchester united

there was one sarcasm didn't get

anything on it really

and also they've got to take one of

these chances

great opportunity for song liz van der

sark comes

doesn't get a great punch on it

volleyback in by gilberto is it

i thought she came off song

you can't take your eyes off it at the

moment it's hargreaves ronaldo making a

move inside the box

and it's parkour got off in the end

well he's missed a glorious chance

lovely ball back across from owen

hargreaves

took his time didn't rush across after

he makes a great run through arsenal

don't pick him up

really park's going to do better from

there thought ronaldo was favorite to

take that

park just takes it off him he wishes he

hadn't done now

i've seen the first yellow card of the

game there for where's brown

well i think he's actually trying to get

out of the way he's certainly not

looking to take algae cliche

that's not a full-blooded challenge by

any stretch of the imagination

it's likely to be a few today

[Applause]

fabregas poised to deliver

cliche

see the crash it was comfortably blocked

by where's brown gail fish it's

never scored this is ronaldo

and zuray and ibu between them and they

may have to do that a few times today

doubling up to deal with it

the kind of situations that also don't

have to panic as i said they've got a

lot of place at the back

they wouldn't really want to but on

occasion they can afford to take another

one-on-one

certainly carlos torre song is no slouch

and we know cliches uh

he's rapidly on the left left full-back

position

there's brown park is pointing the way

but man percy

in the way cled

[Applause]

arsenal keeping their composure but for

their dominance right now

i've not got that opening goal which is

also important for them let's get the

feeling that if united score first

mentally becomes a very very difficult

afternoon for the gunners

[Applause]

arsenal are trying to break down the

meaning that meanest defense in the

premier league and they're

making openings conceded just five goals

here at home manchester united in the

league this season

middlesbrough derby everton and

manchester city the only teams to score

here

an agitated arsene appearing

on the touchline

you must get into the near the penalty

box as well

nicer penalty box left fly as well 20 25

yards out

fabregas we know has got great technique

quite a few long range goals in the last

couple of seasons

roberto's not a great goal scorer well

he doesn't score for somebody so

talented

he's got anywhere near the amount of

goals he

[Applause]

at the moment this is abu eigh

[Applause]

trying to play their way through

fabregas awkward for van der sark

comfortable in the end for the dutchman

making his presence felt that's carrick

looking for rooney

and finding superbowl he's got ronaldo

in support

doesn't think he needs him nearly

underway

by cliche searching ball there from

wayne rooney

this is gilberto and clem

[Applause]

yuzubu is

several penetrating thrusts

never halting in that time this is flat

and available space to work with new get

it back

and even drink for vandasar in the end

our lovely link will play yet again from

arsenal

there we go lovely one two give-and-go

added by all round wes brown

who really didn't know where the big

toga these four would have gone to

unfortunately it's the team finish the

side foot and he might have just taken a

big touch

right around rio ferdinand would have

been one-on-one with vandersoat

rudy getting in behind here this is

danger for arsenal just fought sleeping

a touch the gunners this time

oh they were all that dominance and no

goal

big ball from van der sar and he brushes

aside color toure

song is sleeping really and they'd be

disappointed with that finish wayne

rooney

that's the second clean opportunity

they've had

a wake-up call for alex

[Applause]

gilberto

three in the area for arsenal

[Applause]

left twisting turning but making too

much progress in bouley

characters steal it away but manchester

united

under pressure here to say the least

it's toure

just won't give up the fight but it's pk

he thought he'd stepped away with it

cleve adebayor gilberto

that's brown with the challenge but it's

still not over

cliche

the pace is absolutely breathless at the

moment i don't think we were in the

first 20 minutes

just had that arsenal certainly

really asserting themselves here and

wayne rooney asserting himself in

the way we don't really want to see it

there's a silly boy when rooney

whistler gone already he's lucky enough

to get a yellow card

[Applause]

sorry already on his he's got his ball

in between protecting it

oh nice to see good sportsmanship there

to buoy

where's the joint most booked united

player well wes brown has just

stolen ahead in that particular contest

today

but six times rooney

arsenal satisfied with their efforts but

no reward for them as yet certainly one

or two warning signs as well as they

have to go for this this is fabregas but

carrick

is in there with a footing

i think arsene wenger will be the more

worried of the two managers right now

because they've been a better team by

far no question about that but they've

not

taken any kind of advantage so far

[Applause]

united kicked them off

[Applause]

manchester united but they're also

playing against the side who can

counter-attack like

[Applause]

policed lightning rio ferdinand

with a loss of concentration

and it's invited arsenal to regain the

momentum

every

and yet again lets him down in the final

third that final ball

plenty of promising situations on

tuesday night didn't you manuela bouin

make the most of them brown will get

there at a cliche

luckily she completely pulled out of

that challenge

it was amazing 50 50 ball saw where's

brown coming maybe saw the whites of his

eyes ronaldo's potentially in behind

here song has the time that right and

hasn't

rooney

[Applause]

alex song again a little uncertain

what a fantastic ball from patrice

everett that's the ball of the game

great skill for now though skips it over

song rooney's really should score he

just didn't open his body out

and the sci-fi good save from the ends

layman

brown and it's to the confrontation

between brown and toure that

howard webb's attention has been drawn

we just didn't help wayne rooney that he

was so close in the end to ronaldo when

he played the ball

what an opportunity for united to strike

it's

[Applause]

on defensive duty for arsenal

as you mentioned before if united do

strike first blood here then

it really is going to be an almost

shattering psychological blow for

arsenal

they have a decent record of turning

games around in the last couple of

seasons indeed they did to

victory over united at the emirates last

season

in their current state of mind

for a much more difficult task i was

going to say things are slightly

different aren't they

until end of the season after some

shattering defeats in recent weeks

[Applause]

a little harder mentally they're a lot

more jaded than they have been in big

clashes

this is park they touch

[Applause]

who steps away

percy holding off the challenge of

carrick

she wants

[Applause]

tension of the occasion can play it's

part even for these season

this one who fits campaigners bill

perfectly paul scholes

hargreaves park

united slip into gear now having been

under the cost for much of it

searching for park here

i'm slaying able to read the danger

well as well as they can inject patents

again united with rooney and ronaldo in

particular

they need to really get a group to the

midfield at the moment and carrick and

force goals again so far slightly

bypassing them

there's a guy who can change the face of

the game

what a run that was on tuesday night

against liverpool in the champions

league

it seemed that it was almost going to be

another michael thomas moment between

liverpool and arsenal with just a few

minutes left

that's a second away goal which put

arsenal within

touching distance in the champions

league semi-final

i'm sure we'll see theo walcott today

[Applause]

[Applause]

another moment of inspiration like that

this is rooney

just couldn't quite find skulls yeah

rooney's not happy because he thought he

should have got a free kick and when he

gave the ball away

second or so later but there was no

advantage

quite well by referees in recent weeks

[Applause]

and safely back to vanda

this is carrick who's maintained a place

in

many of the big games this season i mean

hargreaves has occasionally found

himself

out of favor but he does have a bit of a

niggling knee injury

up towards park that's very able to

tidy up after a fashion at least

[Applause]

they call him three lung park because

miss tyler's running

and it's quite inevitable that the

england manager will want to take in

proceedings

could be calling him two cars cappella

because he was at anfield earlier on

taking another game he does get about

doesn't he

i couldn't miss this one

[Applause]

prefers that role just in behind adebayo

this is clever again

looking to feed adebayor a chance for

him

that's not what he

el wanted cannot believe how well his

team is playing and they're not one goal

up

yet again lovely movement their boue

moves

out of the way left picks out the

pinpoint pass to wander by all

that's a really poor you have finish

wonder whether the haircut has contacted

his skull scoring powers in the premier

league because he hasn't got one in the

league since

he's superstitious he won't do it again

a few attempts already today addressing

that balance

[Applause]

i think it's noticeable to do all that

awesome midfield

what have the legs they had a couple of

months ago fabregas there's no

flammability today but

clever as well able to make those

forward runs beyond that

beyond van persie they were doing very

well

certainly before christmas

madison hasn't had the similar luxury

that abram grant and

alex ferguson have had in being able to

rest

many of their key players at crucial

times earlier in the season

manchester united always fresher at this

stage of the campaign it seems

oh we know that but it's a luxury that

they could have afforded themselves with

the biggest squad

simple as that this is adebayor

no one arriving to take advantage of

that

it was the worst crossing world to a

brewery

labour in the far post but no attempt to

really go for that cross

this is van persie

should be quite hard to win that one

this is cliff trying to

cut his way through the united defense

it all breaks down

from the fruit of avua and it briefly

becomes a hot potato the football

you can feel the tension around old

trafford they know them for a game today

and even if united manage not to lose

this game

they'll still feel it's two points

dropped if they don't get the victory

and just how close chelsea are behind

them

the gap would be four points and it's a

cat

in the event of a draw and it's a gap

that chelsea could overhaul they could

be top by the time united the next in

action if united don't win today

chelsea are home to wigan tomorrow

everton on thursday

with a not easy trip to blackburn next

weekend

[Applause]

we know that chelsea could cope with

their squad

tough fixtures schedule that they've got

in the next two weeks or so

slept looking to take on pk and scores

it's a terrific run

first he's still bandaged up but

certainly made a difference to the

arsenal side today it's cliche

ferdinand's outstretched boots it's

gilberto to hit

and he's yet to score this season yeah

it's not about playing many games

yet again it's not a pretty finish and

also have been wasteful in front of goal

so far that's not an easy chance we know

25 yards out

racial berto did get plenty last season

mostly from the penalty spot it should

be added 11

in total in all competitions it's

amazing that he can be first choice for

brazil and not first choice for arsenal

[Applause]

they'll count on they spot three kicks

off the knee off the chest then you work

a few more of the knee off the chest

this is alex

arsenault just haven't been able to find

that breakthrough they've certainly been

the better side by some margin in this

opening half an hour here at old

trafford

galas on the search

and percy taking over towards fabregas

it was carrick's clearance

park with plenty of industry in the

midfield area there

ronaldo fortunate but now he's on one of

those trademark runs

hoping to pick up the pieces but

gilberto

the midfield enforcer recover from

arsenal

[Applause]

who's down i'll simply rescue this

situation

was threatening to come inside the two

of them roberto helps out third man

there's ronaldo ball at his feet the

most dangerous man in the world

last will do well they cover oh they

actually fouled her boy takes his legs

away from him

old weber's right there and doesn't see

that as a free kick

is the golden boy ronaldo

three away from that 40 goal mark

and he hasn't had too many uh sniffs of

an opportunity today

looking to nurse alex song through it a

little

only 21 he's a tough tackler

certainly got some experience men around

him to

make sure he keeps his game in shape

well what language are they speaking

here it was french

it's now bella russian and german well

alexander

i think he's fluent in german as well so

there's a mixture isn't it

absolutely from his time at stuttgart

theo walcott could be a key weapon for

arsenal today

in the ideal state of health at the

moment as he judges off

it's amazing how small decisions can

change the whole course of a season

when arsenal were leading one nil

against chelsea and managed to lose a

game 2-1 you always felt that otherwise

certainly felt that if walcott was

introduced at the time when they were a

goal up mrs chelsea were making some

decisions with an alco etc

they could have brought on lots of

walker to stretch the chelsea defense it

could have been too nil they could have

been

home done and dusted when rafa benitez

made the changes just after

arsene wenger made them you see the

difference it had and bubble came on and

was able to tilt the tide to liverpool's

favor

those are so small things might only be

one or two throughout the season

and then end up bringing you silverware

back with us that's ronaldo carrick

[Applause]

arsenal giving this everything so far

that the

reward has not come their way and it

would just be like manchester united to

pick them off and nick one before the

break

you know physically also look very fresh

at the moment i said i know if they go

go behind mentally will they have the

resources

and all of a sudden you can become tired

if you weren't before if you go

call up and you know things are going

your way for another two days non-stop

country several penalized

[Applause]

these united boys have been in this

situation before

i don't know okay they're not playing

well sir alex seems the strange way

they'll probably be quite pleased

who knows his team have been outplayed

so far

another goal behind and there's a lot

more to come from them i'm sure

with a dominant leap

cannot afford to go behind but

taking the initiative again here through

head and by all to his left

big chance and he couldn't beat edwin

van dijk

well these chances could be arsenal

season yet again united to give the ball

away cheaply

alexander head who's been his star

performer so far so silky footwork

there's a lovely ball for added by i

thought he could have taken another

touch

he decided to go first time to tame

finish

well united should have been punished

and they may

get some payback here it's rooney on the

surge

and it just took a nick on its way

through and united have a corner but

arsenal breathing in all mighty sigh

relief there well lucky lucky arsenal

alexander song doesn't control that ball

rooney's away nearly brought down

by tory oh it's a good stop from jens

lehmann he comes out quickly

and spreads himself rooney can't believe

he's missed looking about a couple of

goals for either side

he could have had a couple himself it's

freo ferdinand steaming in

jens lehmann with a crucial save

for arsenal with a bigger season alive

yeah two big saves he's made

there's the earlier chance lovely

footwork yet again from

alexander kleb adebayo well he doesn't

do anything doesn't go sideways doesn't

blast it

these are glorious opportunities for the

gunners that they're not taking

wayne rooney keeps his balance quite as

they've gone down under pressure

james lame he stands up big and he just

comes off his heel off the side of his

foot

he's got to go down to a great stop and

he's staying on his feet as he did in a

similar incident at that end of the

ground in the game against

liverpool and jens lehmann

keeping arsenal's hopes alive just the

title race

just the finest selection

and it has been a surprise selection

certainly layman will feel it with the

right decision

he's not backward and coming forward in

that respect this is rooney

it's skulls arriving parked beaten to

its ronaldo

cliche away

it has been a pulsating contest of

manchester united

hoping to uh put their foot on the gas

for a spell

united at the moment about their best on

the counter attack

and wayne rooney's

he's usually got that same kind of

stereotyping so we don't know whether

he's happy or sad

[Applause]

contemplating his halftime team talk i'm

sure he knows

that arsenal have had the lion's share

of the play but united have had their

golden opportunities to take the lead as

well

this is

it almost seems as if cliche are happy

just to play container football

and arsenal are the ones who have the

greater need

and percy late and a booking is going to

follow here

that's harsh his first challenge of the

game it's a 50-50 ball there to be won

[Applause]

is slightly favored

yellow card followed through west brown

almost comes into him as much as he goes

in one united fullback

he might have been painful that for

robin van persie

towards rooney can some win it

certainly has been a very interesting

choice

from arsene wenger that song to send

ross at center back today

have you seen anybody with better

control than balancing alexander

cleveland in the last couple of seasons

certainly not any central midfield

though attacking the field

[Applause]

ever out of the tight spots

[Applause]

so capable of picking the killer pass

until we use hargreaves this time

now ronaldo

[Applause]

oh an extravagant touch can hargreaves

find the delivery

turning it behind and the noise level

lifts again

it's a risky ball find it

straightforward

and towards ronaldo and pika who stayed

up there carrick

away by song in the end

there's been a pulsating contest so far

and into the final five minutes of this

first half

who is going to find the first

breakthrough

it's van persie searching for a behavior

that was not what he wanted at all

i wanted to play that ball about 10

seconds earlier decided against it

this is ronaldo going through

extravagant touches but uh

the cristiano ronaldo show so far by any

stretch of the imagination

it has been for much of the campaign

full skulls

ronaldo again

they both have a great need and maybe

that's why united are showing signs of

nervousness

this is hargreaves let's find the cross

oh kick will be the end result

we've seen him much more in an attacking

sense of late certainly on

wednesday night against roma

super performance at night and a super

performance from the ends layman so far

nothing wrong with a big brooding

goalkeeper is that will it be a worrying

monster

um arsene wenger his team have not

turned their dominance into at least one

goal

has had enough chances himself hasn't he

the man who

scored the crucial or didn't turn out to

be that crucial the winner here last

season

united losing twice to arsenal in the

league last season and going on to win

the league

rooney finding scores but then scores

uncharacteristically

not picking out the final pass

this is fabregas hope here for arsenal

he's got claire banana

arriving another

and the tsar down bravely

well he could have actually played that

with his left foot says fabregas

there's the opportunity buyers got the

runner michael carrick just take a swing

with your left foot

that's a difficult ball always arcing

towards a goalkeeper in the end it's a

comfortable stop for the big dutchman in

goal

opportunity for arsenal yet again

searching for the first premier league

medal says fabregas

was around during the era of the

invincibles within player league game

cliche did here he is

[Applause]

hargreaves

[Applause]

it's four years since arsenal were last

top of the tree

in the barclays premier league

[Applause]

certainly on top here fabregas

blocked by evra he was forced into a

shot then says fabregas out of options

nobody coming up on the right side

was in field

[Applause]

just over two minutes remaining in this

first half

it's always psychologically a great time

to get a goal

sometimes can't work again see if you

scored this before time including the

domination

if i've been on top as if you want an

extra 10 minutes to

cement your position

if you can see just before the interval

doesn't look good

worst case scenario this is gilberto

tourey to retrieve for all arsenals

and their opportunities they've still

drawn a blank

plate

[Applause]

longest serving player now at arsenal

such a turnover of flares in recent

years sorry down for signs of uh discord

fraternity club wanted that ball inside

where's brown still a lot of questions

about his future

contract up another play from galas

arsenal fans making their voices heard

for perhaps the first time

to our right-hand side

[Applause]

ronaldo but park can pick it up ronaldo

again

staying on his feet amongst the

challenges hargreaves trying to win it

back

brown does never wants it from carrick

and he can find it rooney

within range and layman tested again

another strike for wayne rooney may have

just been going wide and then as lehman

decides to take no chances

lots of time later

i think it was

safety first two minutes of added time

and we're into those

cliche

[Applause]

browns block to prevent reaching the

growing numbers in the manchester united

penalty area

really hoping to give you enslavement

something to think about but

two-time looking full-backs there as

well go for still struggling to get back

over the halfway line

if west brown was determined to make

that run he could have gone on to the

end of

a wayne rooney pass i have put so much

into this first half arsenal and

particularly when you think about

the efforts they put in as well on

tuesday night you wonder how much there

is in the tank

they found to show at some point as i

said

the goal all of a sudden would make you

a little bit less tired than you were

it's just ronaldo you get the better of

cliche it has

his first real effort on goal in the

game

that one for him to remember that free

kick which

smacked into the wall as well

[Applause]

oh it's been a good half certainly not

the poor satan atmosphere we had at

anfield

there's a special special place on those

european knights anfield isn't it and

it's another big one to come for them

against chelsea this is toure

can get the better of

the ever still battling to get away but

he certainly

won that particular duel now rooney

looking to put pressure on alex song and

see if he's up to it

so many good athletes on show today that

one-on-one they're not afraid to defend

against one another

at some point somebody's going to make

some mistake very often in these big

games

any mistake as opposed to brilliance

will open the door

[Applause]

a great number of chances to give

arsenal a potentially priceless lead

although jens lehmann has also come to

the gunners rescue with at least one

crucial save from wayne rooney who's had

his moments in front of goal as well

it's been an excellent first half but so

far no

breakthrough in this vital battle it's

art it's manchester united nil

arsenal nil

arsenal have done much more than hold

their own in the

first 45 but could their lack of

ruthlessness in front of goal

come back to haunt them certainly it

almost did

in that first half when wayne rooney had

a couple of opportunities to give

arsene wenger real concerned

no changes on either side this week

[Applause]

prepare to begin the second 45

[Applause]

it is a second half here that will

define

arsenal's season they've wasted

opportunities in front of goal in the

first

45 and they live to regret that

in the second as manchester united

attack the stratford end

leading the way in the title race but it

is

as thrilling a race as we've had in the

premier league in

recent years

he has yet to really impose himself

wayne rooney has had

more than a sniff of an opportunity in

front of goal

we never know exactly what the manager

said at

think alex halftime ferguson's words

might have been echoing

but they'll give you composure we know

that arsenal really have to force the

issue

and we can pick them off the longer the

game goes on as long as they don't

commit any silly mistakes in a final

third unit to give the ball away too

cheaply

still feel that they're in control of

this game in many ways

but we have seen one or two moments of

nervousness from manchester united

strangely at the back west brown with a

present possessed fabregas early on

this is jabue making plenty of progress

and the

referee's assistant influencing the

award of the free kick here

[Applause]

the assistant referee gives out no why

doesn't how web he's in as good as the

position to see that

completely clear view it's a clear trip

from pursuit sever there's no complaints

from the left back at all

tackle from behind is that any worsen

from purses just before half time i

don't think so

percy did go into the book but howard

webb not resorting to it on that

occasion

what can the dutchman do here what can

he produce

[Applause]

he's fooled everybody at sleb

fabregas trying to pick their way

through

and percy to take it on four in the

middle of one of them

pure gold for arsenal

emmanuel with a crucial touch and they

lead

less than three minutes into the second

half

well i think he just comes off his chest

in the end but nobody can say that that

goal wasn't coming

united have been stung the opening

seconds of the first half i thought they

wasted the opportunity

but give credit to van persie he doesn't

give this ball when he comes out there's

that big touch right around the back

of cristiano ronaldo and do it well now

he gets a clean contact on it added by

all

well what united doing the goalkeeper

well he looks if he's going to come for

the ball

ferdinand leaves it did he get a shout

from van dijk carrick almost pulls

himself for away from it

he does and adabayo nips it into the net

and arsenal deservedly at last

finally they take the lead

[Applause]

the hand of god maybe

it looked as though the telling touch

was from the forearm of

emmanuel adebayor arsenal will not care

but they're bound to be in quests

well no complaints from the man united

defense i think it was a clean header

his own was it i think just to balance

himself because looks if he's slightly

overrun the ball i don't think he could

believe it actually got through to him

and it's what the neutrals would have

wanted

is certainly what arsenal craved and now

manchester united

to find a way back into this and it's

definitely what arsenal have deserved

this is park

[Applause]

i can't say that manchester united

haven't been warned but there will

certainly be

real real question marks about what

happened at the back

and certainly question marks as to what

part of the body adebayo used to turn it

home

such a cheap goal to give away i thought

van persie was going to bend that

freaking into the box it took everybody

to by surprise i think some of his own

teammates as well

that billy dallied on the edge and when

he came back to him

certainly was full of conviction van

persie and taking that right around the

back and putting in a super cross

into the title race as it stands

the third time in almost as many weeks

they've taken the lead against

one of the big boys if you like chelsea

and arsenal and liverpool

on both those occasions they've

surrendered the lead it certainly isn't

over

it certainly isn't over

this is cleve muscle really got a taste

for it

gilberto busting a gun in the middle oh

ferdinand

what's an escape for united and

edwin van der sar denying

his teammate from putting arsenal to in

front in spectacular fashion

unbelievable full credit to van der sall

because he stays alert

and he had to be further down goes with

the wrong foot with the right foot just

trying to guide it to safety

and then he puts the gunners to nilla

well he really has sprung to life now if

they hadn't already

strep would end hoping to do its usual

job

suck many a ball into that net down the

years for united

in their quests for league titles in the

past

this is up we can't leave that to go

through to the goalkeeper

he's going harmlessly toward well maybe

cristiano could have gone on to the end

of it

no complaints from the arsenal captain

has gone into the book and have arsenal

hit that self-destruct button yet again

just stepped into the penalty area there

ahead of time yeah by about three

players

just from arsenal park and wayne rooney

i think and that's his favorite side as

well cristiano ronaldo

so jens lehmann has been warned i've

seen a glimpse of what may happen

jens lehmann he's never shy of having a

word or two and he's talked himself into

the book here

well maybe that's a yellow card worth

taking just to try not second ronaldo

now will he go the other way

take two for cristiano ronaldo

arsenal's lead lasted less than six

minutes

enjoy unconfined at old trafford

well he did keep his composure the same

side there's a disconsolate figure

not that one who won before william it

doesn't even seem like six minutes since

they scored

great penalty this time keeps it low

yeah the enslavement almost got

fingertips to it

maybe even over overdive if you like

just goes under his hand i think

there's so much pace on that ball a huge

relief

for sir alex and his team arsenal's

swarming forward here they need another

now

they need it quickly fabregas

anderson and teva is waiting on the

touchline here

for manchester united for their

introduction

and suddenly a courtroom-like atmosphere

at old trafford

silenced by adebayo's goal

less than three minutes into this second

half and they're back on song now

and he must have made his mind after

alex to make this double substitution

even before the penalty

if not it's a supremely quick reaction

to that penalty

and it's paul scholes who will depart

and the man who may well prove to be his

long-term replacement

anderson

park also departing carlos tevez

joining the fray

well no surprise look to me at all

they're down that skulls has left the

freight he's been in effect

all afternoon fox night one of his

better days but certainly centrally this

guy

such a bull with his back to goal gonna

be able to bring people in to play very

well carlos everest

and you know what this is the time i

said it before that also needs to be a

bit more proactive even when they're in

the lead didn't hold the lead long

enough

but maybe it's for your world cup time

we'll see if arsene wenger retaliates

with

that particular decision shortly but

it really has come to the boil in more

ways than one here

and a booking for alex

[Applause]

need to keep their composure arsenal

here's a free kick

oh silly boy

alex slept the fourth arsenal name in

howard webb's notebook

two in a very short space of time

surrounding the penalty decision for

galaxan for lehman

twenty

[Applause]

always been brave with his decisions

anyway i think as soon as that penalty

went in

you sense blood as i said maybe maybe

even before

that equalized well we wondered what

sort of psychological blow it would be

to arsenal if they did concede

we will now see what they're made of

mentally

the united support sent blood

in towards ferdinand it's galas

and another corner to defend

i wonder whether his little round at the

end of the birmingham game is sitting

protest was a turning point

signified that the title was slipping

away from arsenal it is

at the moment back there it's rooney to

hit

didn't get hold of it at all carrick

foraging

the decision is well kicked this time

nearly plays the price he won't allow

that ball to bounce

he decides not to clear michael carrick

nearly makes a telling contribution

when rooney on the halfway completely

miscues it and the ball bounces

and you've got to deal with it quickly

across the safety in the end

[Applause]

that goes ferdinando i'm sure was

puffing out his cheeks and relief a

moment ago when he needed it nearly beat

his own goalkeeper

now then has gilberto gone down somewhat

easily there certainly owen hargreaves

thinks so

maybe just an accidental hand into the

face oh each is not happy there juberto

wins the ball

cleanly enough there's no contact there

he's already got the free kick before he

actually goes down

silverto

relatively classic temperament of oh in

our greeks

this is roger alberto just might come

into his own and show his composure

central midfield mary for arsenal

because they're certainly not

shown composure when they've taken the

lead in recent weeks

confirming they're the galaxy yellow

card in the aftermath of the penalty

award

that's fantasy can't clap get on that's

the whistle is gone

oh well

why didn't he wait to play advantage he

looks if he was he looked where the ball

was going

he saw that leopard actually got onto it

and now the ball takes a touch and he's

through one goal

it is a foul doesn't give himself any

opportunity however he does give himself

the opportunity

then change his mind muscle feels

slightly agreed with that decision

they've got no sort of advantage from

the situation arsene wenger making that

point

to peter walton the fourth official but

carrick

going into the book six in all now

it's more like it now is more like an

arsenal man united game

no surprise that it's uh that little uh

controversial edge to it as well

fabric has to deliver away by pk and now

tevez little

warrior figure

[Applause]

is making his way back to the dugout

area down below us and his introduction

would seem to be imminent as we head for

the final half hour

we saw what a devastating impact he

could make at anfield

getting the words of instruction from

fat rice

[Applause]

they've only got two players who can

change the game for them

much more than anybody else and bender

who is a goal scorer

with enough time as well to have a real

impact on the game here's anderson one

of the united substitutes says he has

too much of rooney here

he couldn't get away from william gallas

away my cliche

[Applause]

again today groups

maybe thought about winding up for the

cross certainly wound up by gilberto a

moment ago

[Applause]

well this is the moment

for the introduction of theo walcott

man who made such a devastating

impact with that wonderful run to create

a girlfriend of iora in anfield in

midweek replacing emmanuella

and we talked about the game-changing

potential

on the arsenal bench theo walcott

clearly

their best weapon and there's a sign as

well that the crowd are nervous

walcott's introduction as he was being

roundly booed

took his uh position on the touchline

i won't help that he's a liverpool fan

either

that's no free kick wasn't much of a

local fan on tuesday night was it

[Applause]

this is cliche

[Applause]

van persie pk's block

[Applause]

need a goal they've not scored two in

the league at old trafford and won the

match

since 1979

this is cliche on the search it's a

great run from him almost

warcode-esque cut out by pk

fabregas was lurking and loitering with

considerable intent

well how they need to keep uh united

goalless from now on

[Applause]

anderson battling hard

[Applause]

[Applause]

because he lost that in the physical

challenge and then you can see it coming

straight away

anderson such a strong boy put his body

in the way he was never going to

retrieve the ball cleanly enough so just

allow him to go towards the touchline

they're saying that did that many time

myself that's why i thought anderson

would have been

on the pitch from the beginning of the

game great strength composure they put

his arm and his body in the way

and that was always a yellow card coming

arsenal's fifth of the match

and i suppose it wouldn't be manchester

united against arsenal without one or

two

physical confrontations

[Applause]

alex song underneath it straight to

ronaldo

there were times when it's not looked

comfortable pitched into the thick of

this

titanic clash

old trafford and it's certainly poised

favorably for manchester united in terms

of the title chase

chelsea's still a huge obstacle in it

but arsenal facing elimination from it

[Applause]

that would have been a goal to dream up

and one that would have been replayed

time and time again but just to ride the

target great strike from towers you lay

my nanny covered anyway

if that ball ends up in the back of the

net as a captain i think any other

player on the feature to be straight

over

to alexander song to give him a real

dear bastion instead of him clearing the

ball down the line he's looking for the

perfect pass

in field united go straight down and

nearly score

almost making a relatively instant

impact since his introduction

some meaty challenges van persie's on

his arches at the moment

century nightmares began against

manchester united in the clash at the

emirates last season he's on the ground

again

and so a few others at the moment he's

taking a few

whacks today van persie as he knows he's

not 100

fit only every blow is just sapping his

energy even more and more

[Applause]

door is not enough for arsenal some

sidestepping ronaldo there

he just didn't hold the lead long enough

to really create any tension for man

united

walcott wants it and he's got it back

for fabregas

another great opening oh it's all

created by the pacer walcott

lovely touch inside leb uses body well

reverses the pass

and fabregas while he was certainly

getting those on target early in the

season

that's another good chance for arsenal

[Applause]

13 goals for the season but they have

rather dried up in the

second half of the campaign he's not hit

the target today in his four attempts

this is wayne rooney

no one has enjoyed landing a killer blow

on arsenal more than wayne rooney in his

career

this is ronaldo

walcott receiving possession again and

now fled it's only got out of ayura for

the moment

the cavalry is arriving carrying the

fight himself

cliche involved oh and where's brown

and the woodwork coming to united's

rescue

[Applause]

scene is own players put him in the

firing up line plenty of times today

yet again alexander gleb at the hearts

of all good things coming from arsenal

great ball in from felicity

so much pays on the slightest torch is

dangerous the west brown official

with underside didn't get fingertips to

it

he did it's a great save well it seems

his

teammates are providing the toughest

tests for the dutchman today

but another fantastic save

[Applause]

[Applause]

let him down but he will get a corner

out of it

[Applause]

united will not be satisfied enough with

merely eliminating arsenal from this

race they'll want to win it

this particular match

far greaves

[Applause]

they will knock the gunners out of the

race with victory

the draw would uh well certainly it will

make it virtually impossible now the

mathematically faster to win it of

course

it brings chelsea right back into it

anyway were they you could never rule

them out with the quality they had at

their disposal of their ability to

change the team without really weakening

it

weakening it drastically we just thought

the departure of the special one would

ruin chelsea's chances this season

they've got the understated one now

haven't they avraham grant

this is hargreaves

she's stepping in

[Applause]

i just wonder if nicholas ben is going

to see any action

no van persie's not fit taking quite a

few knocks as i said today

as well throwing the extra forward and

it will also free up a little bit of

space with the likes of your walkway

in particular to decide to change left

or right flank i think if you're ready

if you get that wes brown

who's already on a yellow card be afraid

to bring him down anywhere near the box

walcott certainly will fancy his chances

this is ronaldo presented

straight to him by enslavement well he

wants a free kick which hardweb is not

going to

apply to him with fabregas

cut out by anderson who's got such an

engine

fresh legs as well all important at this

stage

we've already talked about it how much

do arsenal have in reserve

[Applause]

to find something in the next 20 minutes

or so

title dreams barring a mathematical

miracle

really are over there's patrice

ever in uncharted territory rooney and

layman

responds yet again

well they've had an almost personal duel

and it's everett he was fouled by

gilberto

and a free-kick right in ronaldo

territory

almost the first time in the game they

really caught arsenal open

rooney goes for power blasted straight

out of jen's layman and patricia

lovely skill and tricks gilberto silva

this is a chance for united

well it's like jens lehmann has never

been away and he also had the

customary winger referee which has

resulted in a yellow card for him

now hargreaves spotting the ball but i

don't think

any other candidates than this man

let's take a good free kick himself oh

in hargreaves

that's indeed but we've seen the ronaldo

master class on

a number of occasions here at old

trafford

this season can he produce again

it will be hargreaves brilliant

stunning free-kick from owen hargreaves

and it may well be the goal

which puts arsenal out of the title race

once and for all

[Applause]

well what a moment that could be for

arsenal and for the championship

also united taking pole position

or taking a firm grab on pole position

and the element of surprise has done it

because everybody thought ronaldo was

going to take that hargreaves just one

step up you were right down

he did take it and what an execution

that was

well could ronaldo have placed it better

that almost ends up in the side netting

scored one up for them earlier on in the

season and this could really be the

killer blow certainly for arsenal

and sir alex knows how portland that

freaky could beat

well you look at the arsenal body

language after that went in and the

heads were down

it is a real body blow do they have

enough mentally now to

recover from this certainly making a

fist of it here with van persie

and cliche

and even now uh come back to wrestle a

point from this clash will not be enough

to save their title hopes it's van

persie

he's had tougher tests today vandasar

now you have to believe that's it

certainly the majority around old

trafford think it is

and the genuine prospect now of a third

successive

trophyless season for arsene wenger's

arsenal

well this will be the most crushing blow

of all because they led the table for

such a long time

but they really have imploded if you

like i know it's such a harsh word to

use

such a great bunch of footballers

who has not been able to stay at the

place well with

minutes to go at birmingham earlier in

the season those arsenal fans we saw

were

thinking about an eight point lead at

the top of the premier league

an injury-time penalty conceded by gail

please she pegged them back that day

and since then it's been downhill all

the way

i can never underestimate manchester

united when they

come off on the rails as they have done

again

and at this stage of the season

they do look the strongest force in that

premier league chelsea will still have

plenty to say about that

but you feel that a 10th premier league

title is close for sir alex ferguson

has been called back to the arsenal

dugout so he will

add to the armory that walcott will hope

to provide but there are plenty of glam

faces

amongst the arsenal contingent

[Applause]

oh he may be bringing him on now but

probably too little too late

why not give the or want to give the

young man 15 20 minutes

well manchester united will when they

see it again i would imagine they

weren't too many protests at the time

feel

midfield agreed to go behind to the goal

scored by adebayor

which may have come off the arm a tale

of two handballs really because william

gallas

handling to concede the penalty

from then on manchester united have

wrestled the initiative firmly back

it's fantasy who will depart still

nowhere near his sharpness with all his

injury problems and nicholas benner

is to say the least something of a

confident character coming on

impact it's a full it's a shame fully

fit robin van persie

said he's got that ability as well and

how gifted he is

to play either side of a forward like

under bio and give arsenal

much more than he's been able to in

recent games

the final 15 minutes arsenal may be to

salvage some pride they came

back from this position to get a draw

at the emirates earlier in the season

[Applause]

this is ronaldo he's got rooney to his

left and tevez to his right but he's got

plenty to beat

i'm first to say they're not bad options

are they

brown michael carrick

things have been a little different for

the side for arsenal 2004 just after the

invincibles have claimed their crown but

patrick vieira decided to stay and the

move was

called off

alex

rooney really giving colo to a grilling

here

and forcing to throw it

the third goal would really

rub a bag of salt into the wound for

arsenal

on today's performance they don't

deserve it but the game is going to

become more and more stretched

in the final 10 15 minutes well perhaps

not playing at your best and winning is

the key to landing those premier league

titles

this is anderson

by fabregas all the way but he'll come

to rooney and now ronaldo

one or two party pieces coming out or we

saw how frustrated

arsenal got it back with nani in the

four nill in the cup early this season

yeah it's not going to go down too well

and when the farce will keep their

composure as well the young players

plenty walking a bit of a disciplinary

tightrope this is rooney

into tevez i can see what he intended

i still may be able to produce something

here the little argentinian

[Applause]

he's certainly making terrific progress

it's a wonderful run

and he would have been hoping for a

corner there certainly

it's only looked at it though it was

finally it's been given

what i think the assistant darren can

on this near side of plenty of uh

influence in that decision

oh quite rightly so

you can just tell by the way the ball

ends up going out of touch

rather play that just not possible the

one player played in that way

defending plenty of aerial weights but

anderson with a very confident claim

under pressure

and it could be worse for arsenal here

three on three at the moment

[Applause]

but they survive ronaldo three on the

far side

this is warcott

oh factory several that was no nonsense

certainly a character with plenty of

guts factory several

carlos tevez says manchester united just

look to slow it down and take the heat

out of the situation

they have the lead which many will argue

it's not a deserved one

it is if you take your chances and also

really should have been

one goal maybe even two goals up before

half time and that would have put him in

such a more

comfortable position of course united

they could have been running away with

the game

the tears he looks like he's going the

other way this is hargreaves

scorer with that wonderful winner at the

moment

but there are still more than 10 minutes

to play

[Applause]

patrice

just keeping possession and

taking the sting out of proceedings

fabregas though to win it back in

adebayo who's been

probably good as anyone in the arsenal

attack today

fabregas them outside him

three in the area it's wes brown he

stands up

and wins it back with relative comfort

in the end the tackle

but he gave him a chance alexander led

for once he still defeat let him down

just running too close to wes brown

maybe that's a sign of the creeping

tiredness in the arsenal ranks

ronaldo it's brilliant stuff again

apologizing for the other options he had

in there that's such a good run and a

great flick inside

pointing towards to shoot from that

range and from that angle

when you've hit 37 goals up in a season

or 38 now

then you're entitled aren't you

he's on 41 if you add in the goals he

scored for portugal this season

advantage played arsenal might be a

little agreed with that given a

situation they had a little earlier

when it comes to nothing

pk with the challenge and now tevez

really hoping to get back on side

i don't think he has no the flag is up

no he's always going to be tight

to gamble tellers and try sliding

through before they move sideways

[Applause]

quite giving up the ghost arsenal but

maybe the belief has

drained away from them a little they've

forced another corner here

[Applause]

they're still plugging away awesome but

i just feel even if they do get a couple

more chances they'll be so wasteful this

afternoon

and they have to take advantage of it

the gas is delivery it's ferdinand who

meets it

now cliche

and she's delivery food in and again

there's alberto

trying to get there in front of anderson

but was crowded out

united just can't get it away

crucial intervention by ferdinand he was

so unroughly there

i think he saw it all the way rio

ferdinand

united away cheaply on the edge of the

box nobody

anywhere near the halfway line so there

was no outball though

they had to look for the short pass he's

going to be a tense finish as well for

the home side

he's running his socks off to destiny oh

in hargreaves

and what a way to win it if indeed it

does

that's a super freaking layman can do

absolutely nothing about that

everyone was expecting possibly that

result

i'm not expecting it from him

now ronaldo

not only him and rooney really in

contention here

they'll find rooney tevez breaking

ground now this is hargreaves

she showed enough of that to cliche not

quite

i'm so strong tavez strong

and brave he knows he's coming he's

preferred for the challenge he's

preferred to get himself hurt

in order to protect the ball

[Applause]

into the wrestling match was breaking

out there between song and rooney

this is carrick

brown

justin height waiting for his moment to

arrive

[Applause]

this will be the moment for that change

to be made

[Music]

he doesn't appear to be struggling that

much as he makes his way off

well i'm surprised if justin hoyt is

going to fall back

[Applause]

you're not anywhere near the pace of the

game

it is yeah but when there's only a few

minutes remaining

this is brown into tevez

wonderful strike from distance a little

earlier gilberto was not going to allow

him the

opportunity again now walcott in full

flight

bentner

trying to feed it back to theo walcott

fabric has to keep it alive

hook's first involvement's an attacking

one in towards nicholas bentner

able to hold on oh he's going to do

better bender

it's a big line it's a great ball in

front fabregas there's not a lot of pace

on the ball

but he really hangs out well enough he's

steals the marshall rio further now

he's got to power that header right back

across goal refer that right over the

bar

lovely pick out from fabregas that's a

poor attempt

i think he's just on the way down as the

ball reaches him

just escapes the young danes clutches

again but that was a real opportunity

for him

also can i have no complaints today if

they end up with nothing

we've got a hat full of chances

they seem to have found a much more

ruthless edge in the

early part of the season arsenal

certainly has disappeared

in recent weeks they weren't punishing

teams as much as they should have done

kishi

and the tsar lost into some effective

action

i'm still not away yet fabregas and now

hoyt

and gilberto coming in

well that's not an easy chance by any

stretchy imagination

thought he tipped it over edwin van der

sar luckily when rooney was there at

least he would have gone for a corner

[Applause]

well the two united substitutions have

had a massive impact on the game

anderson and carlos tell us there's a

third one coming

well it's not a bad bench to have is it

and ryan giggs

searching personally for his uh tenth

title

he's not on his own in that respect

also closing in on bobby charlton's

appearance record by the weeks

this is battling

felicia trying to rob him but

so competitive walcott

and he's looking to just flick that

switch and get away

cleb

arsenal make another opportunity

oh it's an awful crossing so much time

as well to come back on his stronger

side

arsenal still making the effort

he's not laid down and died here

we are heading into the final two

minutes of normal time stoppage to

stoppages to come

point getting it back from cleve bentner

you're 12 yards from goldmine just take

a touch and open yourself up and have a

strike on goal

looking for the perfect pass and a

perfect finish that's the old criticism

of arsenal

i have a needle of stuff there and this

is ronaldo pretty much all on his own

[Applause]

this is hoyt gig's still waiting to come

on

[Applause]

fabregas

cled off it by carrick but hassled off

it unfairly

the midfielder who's on the booking and

it's worth the challenge

it's worth taking a free cake just to

take the steam out of the game

[Applause]

for kicks arrival and the queue for the

departure of the man who's

stunning free kick is the difference

between the two sides

[Applause]

departing as we head into the

final minute of the 90

three added minutes

[Applause]

and ryan giggs 34

cooking up his 751st appearance for

manchester united

[Applause]

and bentner forces vandasar into a save

[Applause]

i've lost countless the amount of

opportunities down

it's another great opportunity for nice

bender

and it's not a it's not a great attempt

i know he gets it on top he's been

pulled by cristiano ronaldo

but yet again he should be going back

across goal he has it into the ground

and gives vanessa

a chance

again he's really played his part today

some wonderful saves it's gonna be four

minutes of added time

an extra minutes and maybe more

punishment for arsenal

she is still got plenty in the tank as

you can see

lunch from rooney wasn't it

have he taken his first half

opportunities how different it could be

he took one at the start of the second

well rooney's getting a little

hot-headed here

well he felt that i had to buy all lunch

[Applause]

arsenal battling more to save a bit of

pride

than anything else now just over three

minutes of the added time remaining

[Applause]

and adebayor has gone down rather easily

there

surely that's on board from west brown

and there's no difference accidental

stopping arsenal

[Applause]

again just slow the pace

well when united have had their

opportunities for the penalty spot the

wonderful hargreaves free kick

they have taken them arsenal lost count

of the number of

opportunities on goal they've had today

decent ones

rooney's frustration building and

building

oh he's a guy who never gives up never

stops trying wayne rooney doesn't accept

any decision against him does it

the old trafford crowd playing for the

final whistle

they look to have got the victory in the

latest installment of this

increasingly bitter feud

also just desperate to salvage something

to draw

the wind is out of the question now this

is

[Applause]

looking to attack it it was pk who won

it

ronaldo picking up the pieces and he may

well do more than that although he's up

against

three arsenal players here

heading straight to the corner

rooney looking for giggs who's got

half of old trafford to himself here

tevez good play from united

we're stretching the game forcing

ourselves to cover lots of ground to try

and recover the ball

brown

a little flip from treves and into the

final minute

is there to be a final flourish here for

united

standing ovation for their display of

keep ball there

that's all they need to do united no

showboating

no real time wasting tactics in the

corner just invited him to have yourself

kicked

over there conceding a free-kick he's

given away lots of those today joberto

he's been slightly off the face of the

game

and it's his tackle really that led to

the free kick led to money united's

winner surely

it looks as though it's all over for us

and for another year

the third year in a row it looks as if

there'll be no silverware

heading for the arsenal trophy cabinet

and ronaldo felled cruelly

looking for justin hoyt and uh it means

now

it's uh arsenal have wrapped up six

yellow cards today and uh the fa will be

having more than words they'll be

issuing them with a five we don't like

to see anybody being capable of ronaldo

we've had that coming didn't he dancing

i'm just surprised that

boy kept his composure for so long it's

a two-horse race for the title now

arsene wenger's arsenal surely

eliminated here

cristiano ronaldo's penalty equalizer

turning the game

in united's favor we expected him to

apply a stunning free-kick later on but

it was owen hargreaves who took it and

dispatched it brilliantly

and william gallas team now

need an absolute mathematical miracle

their chances

are in all probability gone

some forlorn faces in arsenal colours

manchester united jubilant they've

widened the gap on chelsea tonight as

well to six points

it's a vital win for manchester united

in their tilt for a 10th premier league

title

arsenal's dreams have been shattered

here

the final score manchester united two

arsenal one

hey

1
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,078
Mr. Soprano?

2
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:02,705
Yeah.

3
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:14,884
Have a seat.

4
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:48,209
My understanding from Dr. Cusamano,
your physician...

5
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:50,086
...is that you collapsed.

6
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:54,090
Possibly a panic attack?
You were unable to breathe?

7
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:57,218
They said it was a panic attack.

8
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,847
The blood and neurological
work came back negative.

9
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:04,434
And they sent me here.

10
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:06,728
You don't agree that
you had a panic attack?

11
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,108
How are you feeling now?

12
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:13,359
Good.

13
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:16,237
Fine. Back at work.

14
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,782
What line of work are you in?

15
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:22,243
Waste management consultant.

16
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:32,462
It's impossible for me to
talk to a psychiatrist.

17
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:37,008
Any thoughts at all
on why you blacked out?

18
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,804
I don't know. Stress, maybe.

19
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,807
About what?

20
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:53,942
I don't know.

21
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,987
The morning I got sick,
I'd been thinking.

22
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,159
It's good to be in something
from the ground floor.

23
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,496
And I came too late for that, I know.

24
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:10,792
But lately, I'm getting the feeling
that I came in at the end.

25
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,418
The best is over.

26
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,838
Many Americans, I think,
feel that way.

27
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,549
I think about my father.

28
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,219
He never reached the heights like me.

29
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,346
In a lot of ways he had it better.

30
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,934
He had his people, they had
their standards, they had pride.

31
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,811
Today, what do we got?

32
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:39,195
Did you have these feelings of loss
more acutely before you collapsed?

33
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,073
I don't know.

34
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:03,261
A couple months before, these
two ducks landed in my pool.

35
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:07,557
It was amazing. They're from Canada,
and it was mating season.

36
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:10,685
They had some ducklings.

37
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,899
Come on, get some bread.

38
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,994
My daughter's friend was there
to drive her to school.

39
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:32,582
- Meadow, your father with those ducks.
- The yard smells like duck poo.

40
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,793
You gotta have more than
just juice for breakfast.

41
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:40,256
You need brain food for school.
Happy birthday, handsome.

42
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:42,800
- Thirteen.
- He doesn't act it.

43
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:46,763
The male and female duck made
a home in your pool and did it?

44
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,515
Get out of here! You're so gross!

45
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:52,101
You want some of
last night's sfogliatelle?

46
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,146
- Get out of here with that fat.
- One bite.

47
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,106
How do you stay skinny,
Mrs. Soprano?

48
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,945
Him, with those ducks.

49
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:07,116
If you don't like that ramp, I'll
build another. Maybe it's the wood.

50
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:18,628
Look, they're trying to fly.

51
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,174
- National Geographic, Dad.
- Yeah, super.

52
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:26,135
- You showed us yesterday.
- This is great!

53
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:30,807
Now my wife feels
this friend is a bad influence.

54
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:34,143
It's so cool you're coming to Aspen
with my family at Christmas.

55
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:38,856
Last year I saw Skeet Ulrich,
as close as from where you're sitting.

56
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:40,983
Miss Meadow, we made a deal.

57
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:45,822
Keep your grades up and your curfew
until Christmas, then you get to go.

58
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,657
I know that.

59
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,950
Good morning.

60
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,369
- Hey, Mr. Soprano.
- We're late, Dad.

61
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:53,871
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks, Dad.

62
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:05,174
You're gonna be home tonight for
Anthony Jr.'s birthday party, right?

63
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:09,345
Birdman, hello!

64
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:12,223
Yeah, yeah.
I'll get home early from work.

65
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:15,184
I'm not talking about work.

66
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:20,857
This won't work.
I can't talk about my personal life.

67
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:24,026
Finish telling me
about the day you collapsed.

68
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:31,659
I drove to work with my nephew.
He's learning the business.

69
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:34,370
He's an example of what
I was talking about before.

70
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:38,916
Did you call Triborough Towers
about the hauling contract?

71
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:42,879
I got home too late.
I didn't want to wake the man up.

72
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,717
Did you get up early and call?
He's always in his office by 6.

73
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,888
I was nauseous. My mother told me
I shouldn't even come in today.

74
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:56,058
Bear in mind, this is a kid who
just bought himself a $60,000 Lexus.

75
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,026
- There's that guy Mahaffey.
- Get out.

76
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,737
Right there.
Next to the boo-boo in pink.

77
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,406
Back up.

78
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:25,922
My friend Mahaffey
pulling his taffy. Hello.

79
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,798
We saw this guy.

80
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,218
There was an outstanding loan.

81
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:31,594
One second.

82
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:36,098
I don't know
where this story is going.

83
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:41,562
But there are a few ethical ground
rules we should get out of the way.

84
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,274
What you tell me here...

85
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,778
...falls under
doctor/patient confidentiality.

86
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,613
Except if I was...

87
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:55,910
If I was to hear, let's say,
a murder was to take place...

88
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,120
Not that it would, but if.

89
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:02,291
If a patient tells me a story
where someone's going to get hurt...

90
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,461
...I'm supposed to go
to the authorities.

91
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:07,964
Technically.

92
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,303
You said you were in waste management.

93
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:16,138
The environment.

94
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:19,225
Dr. Cusamano, besides
being your family physician...

95
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,978
...is also your next-door neighbor.

96
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,646
See what I'm saying?

97
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:27,233
I don't know what happened
with this fellow, I'm...

98
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,277
I'm just saying.

99
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,363
Nothing.

100
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:34,657
We had coffee.

101
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:36,742
Alex!

102
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,327
Help!

103
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,003
Security! Help!

104
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,963
Oh, shit.

105
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:09,692
Asshole!

106
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:15,197
Tony!

107
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:16,866
Wait up!

108
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,915
Security!

109
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,108
You all right?

110
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,736
My leg is broken.
The bone's coming through.

111
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,071
Let me see.

112
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:58,824
I'll give you a fucking bone,
you prick! Where's my fucking money?

113
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,243
So you had coffee.

114
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:02,912
Right.

115
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,831
You son of a bitch, motherfucker.

116
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:14,590
- What are you doing? Get over here!
- That's $3000 here. $3000.

117
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:15,883
Go ahead.

118
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:20,638
Where's the fucking money?

119
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:22,264
I'll get the money!

120
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:23,766
I know you will.

121
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:27,269
You should get a cork in your mouth
because you say I'm nothing...

122
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:30,272
...compared to the people
who used to run things. Prick.

123
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,274
I'm nothing.

124
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:39,782
Shut up.

125
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,120
What are you crying about? HMO.
You're covered.

126
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,080
You prick.

127
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,126
Degenerate fucking gambler.

128
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:51,877
Go on.

129
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:53,629
Next, I had a meeting.

130
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,425
I was called in to consult by
a garbage-hauling company I represent.

131
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,635
What's the story
with Triborough Towers?

132
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:04,640
The manager wants the contract
with Dick, but this Kolar Sanitation...

133
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,809
Another nationwide company.

134
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:10,813
The Kolar brothers. Czechoslovakian
immigrants or some shit.

135
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:14,024
These Polacks will haul
paper, plastic and aluminum...

136
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:15,943
...for 7000 a month less than Dick.

137
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,821
They pay us 40 times the monthly
for stealing a stop.

138
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:20,614
That's the thing. They won't.

139
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:25,327
Says if he can tell the commie bosses
in Czechoslovakia to fuck off...

140
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:27,329
...he can fucking tell us.

141
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,124
- I give up.
- Fucking garbage business.

142
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,543
Yeah, I know. It's all changing.

143
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,503
Let me see what I can do.

144
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,339
Sure? You over your stomachache?

145
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:39,508
- Oh, yeah.
- Good.

146
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,428
What are you doing here?

147
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,723
Gabriella sends me
down here for the capocollo.

148
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,434
Hey, T, let me ask you something.

149
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:51,979
Didn't you used to go to school
with Artie Bucco?

150
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:55,065
A situation came up.
It involves my uncle.

151
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,485
I can't go into details.

152
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:58,694
That's fine.

153
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:03,032
But I will say this. My uncle
adds to my general stress level.

154
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,701
It's none of my business...

155
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,829
...but down at the club,
the word is...

156
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,041
...your Uncle Junior
is gonna whack Pussy Malanga.

157
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,880
He's gonna do it
at Artie Bucco's restaurant.

158
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:30,518
Hey, boys. How are you?

159
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:34,063
Don't move.

160
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,732
- Uncle Junior, how you doing?
- Hey.

161
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:38,984
Hey, good to see you.

162
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:40,736
Hi there, Chris.

163
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:45,074
I was talking about you. It's Anthony
Jr.'s birthday tonight, right?

164
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:49,912
Don't buy him anything big,
we overindulge him. Okay?

165
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:52,581
Hey!

166
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,543
- Artie, how's your rash?
- It's itchy.

167
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:56,794
Come here.

168
00:13:57,796 --> 00:14:01,048
- Good to see you. You'll come over?
- Yeah, have a seat.

169
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,138
You know what it means, one of
these mutts gets wet in here?

170
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,599
It'll ruin his business.

171
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,060
You better sit down with your uncle.

172
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,649
Uncle Junior's my father's brother.

173
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:21,735
A good guy, just getting old, cranky.

174
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,615
He used to take me to Yankee games
when I was a kid.

175
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:28,617
I love my uncle.

176
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,621
At the same time, when I was young...

177
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:36,625
...he told my girl cousins
I would never be a varsity athlete.

178
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,753
Frankly, that was a tremendous blow
to my self-esteem.

179
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,361
Who's there?

180
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:05,821
It's me, Ma.

181
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,490
Who are you?

182
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:10,993
Ma, open the door.

183
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:18,125
- Anthony?
- Yeah, it's me. Open the door.

184
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,590
Hi, how are you?

185
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,677
Jeez, Ma. Get some air in here.

186
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,388
Did you lock the door?

187
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,017
- Yeah, I did.
- Somebody called here last night.

188
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:37,394
- After dark.
- Who?

189
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,230
You think I'd answer?
It was dark out.

190
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,358
Ma, I'll never understand that.

191
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,860
The phone is auditory.
Dark is an eye thing.

192
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:48,489
I could understand not going out.
You could get jumped.

193
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:49,865
But the phone?

194
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:54,828
Listen to him, he knows everything.
You want some lunch? I got eggplant.

195
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:58,374
No, no, I just ate.
Know who I just ran into?

196
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,541
Uncle Jun.

197
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:04,630
Oh, that one. You think he ever
comes to see his sister-in-law?

198
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,132
Remember Artie Bucco?

199
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:09,385
Kid I went to elementary school with?

200
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:13,180
Oh, yeah, I still see his mother.

201
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,433
She tells me...

202
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:20,020
...he calls her every day.

203
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,565
Well, Uncle Junior's gonna
make a problem for Artie.

204
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,192
Could affect his livelihood.

205
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:28,195
- What's that?
- CD player.

206
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,280
For who?

207
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:31,740
For me?

208
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,034
- I don't want it.
- You don't want it.

209
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:38,247
You love music, all the old stuff's
on CD. Your favorites.

210
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:40,582
"Pajama Game," Connie Francis.

211
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:41,917
Here.

212
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:46,755
Come on.

213
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,091
Move around a bit.
It's good for you.

214
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:51,385
What? No.

215
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:55,097
- Come on. Come on.
- Stop it.

216
00:16:56,766 --> 00:17:00,811
You need to occupy your mind. When
Dad died, you were gonna do things.

217
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:04,940
- He was a saint.
- I know he was. But he's gone.

218
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,068
You were gonna travel, volunteer.
You've done nothing.

219
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:11,280
Stop telling me how to live my life.
Just shut up.

220
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:13,282
I just worry...

221
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:16,452
And don't start with that
nursing home business again.

222
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:20,497
It's not a nursing home,
it's a retirement community!

223
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,418
You interact with seniors
your own age, go places, do things!

224
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,004
I've seen women in nursing homes...

225
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,965
...in these wheelchairs,
babbling like idiots!

226
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,967
Here, eat your eggplant.

227
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,303
I told you, I already ate lunch.

228
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:39,308
All right, listen.

229
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,270
You just speak to Uncle Junior
about Artie, okay?

230
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,314
He respects you.
He'll listen to you.

231
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:50,319
If your uncle has business with Arthur,
he knows what he's doing.

232
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:54,948
And I don't?

233
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:59,745
Well, all I know is...

234
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,873
...daughters are better at taking care
of their mothers than sons.

235
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:06,001
Yeah, and I bought CDs
for a broken record.

236
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:14,551
I expect to see you at Anthony Jr.'s
party with your baked ziti.

237
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,805
Only if I'm picked up
and I'm brought back home.

238
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:21,391
I don't drive
when they're predicting rain.

239
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,977
You're healthy.
It's good for you to drive.

240
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:26,396
Use it or lose it.
I gotta go to work.

241
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,023
Sure...

242
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:30,025
...run off!

243
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:34,696
And that night was
my son's birthday party.

244
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:37,699
My wife invites the priest.
He's always at the house.

245
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,159
- Hey, Tony.
- How you doing?

246
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:41,745
- You like crème anglaise?
- You bless it, I'll eat it.

247
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:42,913
She's not coming.

248
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:44,998
- Who?
- Grandma just called.

249
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,417
She started crying and hung up.

250
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:50,420
- She needs a purpose.
- She's tougher than you think.

251
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,090
- So, what? No fucking ziti now?
- Hey!

252
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:26,748
At first it felt like...

253
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,917
...ginger ale in my skull.

254
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:43,140
- Mom, Daddy just fell! Mom!
- Oh, my God. Tony!

255
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:47,561
Get back!

256
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,898
Daddy! Dad!

257
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:53,609
Anthony Jr., call 911.

258
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:10,918
Dr. Cusamano put me in the
hospital, gave me every kind of test.

259
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:22,638
Okay.

260
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,144
Hey! Carm.

261
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:35,943
- Thought you might want some company.
- Yeah.

262
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:39,488
6:30 in the morning.

263
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:45,118
- How are the kids?
- They're worried about you.

264
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:49,289
I told Anthony Jr.
we'd rain-check his birthday.

265
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:59,174
Think I got a brain tumor?

266
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,510
Well, we're gonna find out.

267
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:04,680
What a bedside manner.
Very encouraging.

268
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,556
What, are you gonna not know?

269
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:14,147
We had some good times.
Had some good years.

270
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:16,316
Here he goes with the nostalgia.

271
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:18,360
No marriage is perfect.

272
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:20,362
Having that goomar on the side helps.

273
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:24,199
I'm not seeing her anymore.
What about that priest?

274
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,826
Don't even go there.

275
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:29,746
Father is a spiritual mentor.
He's making me a better Catholic!

276
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:32,708
Well, we all got different needs.

277
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:36,712
What's different between us is,
you're going to hell when you die.

278
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:59,776
My nephew, Christopher, was
handling the garbage contract problem.

279
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,904
But on this I will also
not go into detail.

280
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:21,631
Emil Kolar.

281
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,884
Chris Moltisanti.

282
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:27,721
Hey, in Czech Republic too,
we love pork.

283
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,806
You ever have our sausages?

284
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:34,603
No. I thought the only sausages
they had was Italian and Jimmy Dean's.

285
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:38,106
See what you learn when you
cross cultures and shit?

286
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,277
My Uncle Evzen doesn't know I came.

287
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,946
If we make any progress,
I'll tell him.

288
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:49,159
Hey, we have to make progress, Emil.
We gotta stop the madness.

289
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,329
Business is changing,
we're the younger generation.

290
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:54,122
We have issues in common.

291
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:56,917
Emil.

292
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:01,296
Where'd you go to high school?
Was it Poland?

293
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:03,840
I'm not Polish.

294
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:07,135
Czechoslovakian,
that's a type of Polack, right?

295
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:10,764
We came here when I was 9.
I went to West Essex.

296
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:14,142
You used to play my cousin Gregory
in football, he...

297
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:17,437
- Where's the stuff?
- Yes, yes, yes.

298
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:23,610
The reason for the visit.
We got it all deployed for you.

299
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:26,822
Taste the wares, Emil.

300
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:28,990
Emil.

301
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:58,395
The doctors kept me hanging
about the tests, as doctors will do.

302
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:02,357
So my uncle and I played
a round of golf and had lunch.

303
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:06,027
You keep mentioning your uncle.
What's the problem?

304
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:07,696
Who do you think you are?

305
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:11,158
I'm the person who says
how things go, that's who.

306
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:15,203
Artie's dinner business is nice,
upscale people from the suburbs.

307
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:16,830
Don't ruin his life.

308
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,875
Vesuvio is where Pussy feels safe.

309
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:22,627
He's been eating here all his life.

310
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:24,713
You kill him someplace else.

311
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:28,049
You may run North Jersey,
but you don't run your uncle!

312
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:31,761
How many fucking hours did I spend
playing catch with you?

313
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:39,728
Can we focus more
on your immediate family?

314
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,690
My wife and daughter
were not getting along.

315
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:49,279
Darn, these laser discs
are incredible!

316
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:55,076
Tony watches Godfather II. He says
it looks just like the movie theater.

317
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:57,662
Gordon Willis.
Tony prefers II, not I?

318
00:24:57,914 --> 00:25:00,582
He likes where Vito
goes back to Sicily.

319
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:03,084
With III, he was like,
"What happened?"

320
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:04,669
Where does Tony rank Goodfellas?

321
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:09,090
What, do you have raccoons?

322
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,968
- Somebody's jimmying a window.
- What?

323
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,597
You have all these security
lights, who would try and?

324
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:19,267
Oh, no. Jeez, Louise!

325
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:21,269
Hold it!

326
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:22,938
Meadow.

327
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,610
I noticed the glass rattles every time
I walk to the laundry room.

328
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:30,612
Do we have any putty?

329
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,989
Don't give me that.
You snuck out!

330
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:34,449
What's going on?

331
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,077
You locked my bedroom window
so I'd get caught.

332
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:40,455
Normal people thought you were
upstairs doing your homework!

333
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:44,292
You have become a master
of lying and conniving.

334
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:46,127
I know I'm grounded.

335
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,089
Patrick's swim meet is tomorrow,
and he needed me!

336
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:52,467
Grounded for this?
Oh, no, you're not grounded.

337
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:56,846
You're not going to Aspen
with Hunter Scangarelo!

338
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:58,640
Yes!

339
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:00,767
But this shit I'm telling you...

340
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:03,144
...it'll all blow over.

341
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:10,235
Didn't you admit to Dr. Cusamano
that you were feeling depressed?

342
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:23,498
"Melfi."

343
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:26,835
What part of the boot you from?

344
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:29,004
Dr. Melfi.

345
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:32,465
My father's people were from Caserta.

346
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:34,175
Avellino.

347
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:37,512
My mother would have loved it
if you and I got together.

348
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:49,024
Anxiety attacks are legitimate
psychiatric emergencies.

349
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:51,526
Suppose you were driving
and you passed out.

350
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:53,194
Let me tell you something.

351
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:56,531
Nowadays, everybody's gotta go
to shrinks and counselors...

352
00:26:56,824 --> 00:27:00,327
...and go on Sally Jessy Raphael
and talk about their problems.

353
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:03,204
Whatever happened to Gary Cooper?

354
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:05,707
The strong, silent type?

355
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,375
That was an American.

356
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:10,295
He wasn't in touch
with his feelings.

357
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:14,215
They didn't realize once they got Gary
Cooper in touch with his feelings...

358
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:15,884
...they wouldn't be able
to shut him up!

359
00:27:16,177 --> 00:27:19,095
So it's dysfunction this and
that! And dysfunction va fangool!

360
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,390
You have strong feelings about this.

361
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,186
I had a semester and a half
of college...

362
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:29,898
...so I understand Freud.
I understand therapy as a concept.

363
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:32,817
But in my world, it does not go down.

364
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:36,738
Could I be happier?
Yeah. Yeah. Who couldn't?

365
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:39,407
Do you feel depressed?

366
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:44,454
Do you feel depressed?

367
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:52,212
Since the ducks left...

368
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:54,714
I guess.

369
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:58,593
The ducks that preceded
your losing consciousness.

370
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:01,137
Let's talk about them.

371
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,904
You can't blame T for being pissed.
You should have waited.

372
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:20,615
That's the last time I show
any fucking initiative.

373
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,951
Imagine how I felt?

374
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,744
T's running down the business...

375
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:27,288
...I fucking wet a guy
to keep one of our stops.

376
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:30,959
He's not running it down.
It's just getting harder in New York.

377
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:34,129
One.

378
00:28:34,422 --> 00:28:35,630
Two.

379
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,257
Three.

380
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,467
Come on!

381
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,303
- This is fucked up.
- What, Pussy?

382
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:46,099
The Kolar uncle is gonna find the kid
dead on one of his bins...

383
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:48,935
...and get out of our
fucking business? No way.

384
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:51,187
"Louis Brassi sleeps with the fishes."

385
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:54,607
Luca Brassi.

386
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:56,317
- Luca.
- Whatever.

387
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,404
There's differences, Christopher.

388
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:02,323
From the Luca Brassi situation
and this?

389
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:08,204
Look, if the Kolars know the kid is
dead, it hardens their position.

390
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:12,125
Plus, now the cops are looking
for a fucking murderer.

391
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:13,668
What do you want to do?

392
00:29:14,128 --> 00:29:17,005
He disappears.
He never comes home.

393
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,340
They know, but they don't know.

394
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,927
They hope maybe he'll turn up... if.

395
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:26,639
Come on. Let's get him.

396
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:28,475
Got him?

397
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:31,227
Take him to Staten Island,
I'll cut him up.

398
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,856
Pussy, you know, with T
collapsing at the birthday...

399
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:38,985
...what would you do
if he was, like, disabled?

400
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:40,987
Why would you even ask that?

401
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:45,700
Our lecture series in action.

402
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,744
Someone from the university
discussing...

403
00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:51,247
...the novels of, I believe,
Zora Neale Hurston.

404
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:55,668
Didn't you just read her
in school, Med?

405
00:29:56,879 --> 00:29:58,379
It's very nice.

406
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:06,721
You know, Grandma,
this place is neat.

407
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:08,890
You should really think about it.

408
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:12,227
This room was renovated last year.

409
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,978
What goes on behind there?

410
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:17,106
Those doors lead to our nursing unit.

411
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:20,235
This is a nursing home!

412
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:22,403
This is a residence,
but just in case...

413
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:25,740
No, you're not getting me
into a nursing home.

414
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,784
You're not listening
to what she's saying.

415
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:30,286
Women in wheelchairs,
babbling like idiots!

416
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,121
Ma, you're not listening.

417
00:30:32,373 --> 00:30:35,375
You think you're so high and mighty,
don't you?

418
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:38,086
With your fancy office.

419
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:41,548
Anthony, people come here to die!

420
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:50,265
Oh, my God! Somebody get a doctor.

421
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:03,111
So you've come back for help.
Don't look at that as a defeat.

422
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:06,322
She's one of those who grew up
during the Depression.

423
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:09,450
But the Depression to her
was a trip to Six Flags.

424
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,286
There's that "D" word again.

425
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:19,752
Stay with your mother.

426
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:27,760
Now that my father's dead,
he's a saint.

427
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:31,931
When he was alive, nothing.

428
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:39,647
My dad was tough, he ran his own crew.

429
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:44,444
A guy like that and my mother
wore him down to a little nub.

430
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:47,780
He was a squeaking little gerbil
when he died.

431
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:52,660
Quite a formidable maternal presence.

432
00:31:56,373 --> 00:32:01,502
I gotta be honest. I'm not getting
any satisfaction from my work, either.

433
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,004
Why?

434
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:06,341
Well, because of RICO.

435
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:09,802
- Is he your brother?
- No. The RICO Statutes.

436
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:11,346
Oh, of course, right.

437
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:12,513
You read the papers?

438
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:14,849
You know, the government's using
electronic surveillance...

439
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:19,604
...and various legal strategies
to squeeze my business.

440
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:27,153
Do you have any qualms about
how you actually make a living?

441
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,739
Yeah.

442
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,243
I find I have to be the sad clown.

443
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:37,622
Laughing on the outside...

444
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:39,499
...crying on the inside.

445
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,210
See, things are trending downward.

446
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:46,839
Used to be, a guy got pinched,
he took his prison jolt.

447
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:49,717
Everybody upheld a code of silence.

448
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:53,221
Nowadays, no values.

449
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:56,724
Guys today have no room
for the penal experience.

450
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:59,060
So everybody turns government witness.

451
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,942
I feel exhausted
just talking about it.

452
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:11,572
Well, with today's pharmacology,
no one needs to suffer...

453
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:15,368
...with feelings of
exhaustion and depression.

454
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:20,123
Here we go.
Here comes the Prozac.

455
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:29,966
Mahaffey doesn't have it.

456
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:31,926
What do you mean
he doesn't have it?

457
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:33,261
He doesn't have the money.

458
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:34,762
How can he not have the money?

459
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:37,265
The man does not have the money.

460
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:39,934
We ran the man over with the car.
T, himself.

461
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:43,479
The man has no wiggle room.
He's bled dry.

462
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:49,444
So...

463
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:53,239
...I hear Junior wants to
whack Pussy Bompensiero?

464
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:56,117
- Pussy Malanga.
- Oh, Little Pussy.

465
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:58,619
You think he's gonna
fuck with Big Pussy?

466
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:00,413
My Pussy?

467
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:02,457
Andrea.

468
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:07,295
Stay with drinks on the house
all night.

469
00:34:07,755 --> 00:34:10,131
- Sorry, Mr. Dante.
- It's okay.

470
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:15,303
So your uncle resents
that you're the boss.

471
00:34:15,596 --> 00:34:17,138
The sadness accrues.

472
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,141
Your uncle's had a hard-on
his whole life.

473
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,518
First, against your father,
his younger brother...

474
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,604
...because he was a made man
before him.

475
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:26,481
And now, you.

476
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:30,651
So, sure, he can't stomach
your telling him what to do.

477
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:33,154
Hesh, I love the man.

478
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:37,116
The man is driven in toto
by his insecurities.

479
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:39,619
I feel bad I was the messenger.

480
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:44,248
Your friend Artie,
with the restaurant.

481
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,125
Get him out of town.

482
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:50,755
That way the restaurant closes,
the hit goes down someplace else.

483
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:54,634
You old fucking Jew.

484
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:57,136
No wonder my old man
kept you around so long.

485
00:34:57,346 --> 00:35:00,848
So what about this fucking Jew's
250 on Mahaffey's 100?

486
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:07,772
Mahaffey has a new business partner...

487
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:09,273
...you.

488
00:35:09,525 --> 00:35:11,359
These HMOs pay out millions...

489
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:14,153
...to doctors, hospitals, whatever.

490
00:35:14,488 --> 00:35:17,490
That MRI I had,
$2000 a pop.

491
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,992
Now, we give this Mahaffey a choice.

492
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:22,578
Either his company pays out
phony claims...

493
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,039
...to fake clinics we set up...

494
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:29,710
...or he pays Hesh
the 250 grand he owes him...

495
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,171
...which we know he cannot do.

496
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,552
Or it's a rainy night in Lyndhurst.

497
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:42,098
Very smart.
Could be major.

498
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:44,559
Could be as good as garbage.

499
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:48,729
- Garbage is our bread and butter.
- Was.

500
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:01,117
Miss Meadow!

501
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,538
So, Med.

502
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:08,249
I'm not going.

503
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:12,587
Every year, on this date,
since you were itty-bitty...

504
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,922
...Mom and Meadow get all dolled up...

505
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:20,094
...drive into New York Plaza Hotel
for tea under Eloise's portrait.

506
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:21,971
Look, where's yours?

507
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:23,723
I have too much homework.

508
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:26,100
Meadow, its our little tradition!

509
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:27,935
We always have so much fun!

510
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:31,439
To tell you the truth,
I felt it was dumb since I was 8!

511
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:34,066
I just go because you like it.

512
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:41,782
Here I thought this was something we
would do long after you got married...

513
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:43,910
...with girls of your own.

514
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,870
Hopefully I won't be
living around here by then.

515
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:48,122
You've got mail.

516
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:54,921
Meadow, you can't just lie and cheat
and break the rules you don't like!

517
00:36:57,507 --> 00:37:00,134
What? You have something
you want to say?

518
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:05,598
Mom, do you have any idea how much
it means to go skiing in Aspen?

519
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:08,267
Do you think that'll
happen every year?

520
00:37:08,477 --> 00:37:11,938
Like lame tea and scones
at the Plaza Hotel?

521
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:17,485
- Goodbye.
- Close my door, please.

522
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:20,196
Artie.

523
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:25,159
Give me a drop. Oh! A drop,
not a spurt. Soave, a drop!

524
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:28,788
- How are you?
- All right. Stir the meatballs.

525
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:31,666
- Could you help me out?
- Yeah, what do you need?

526
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:33,834
Cruise. Caribbean.

527
00:37:34,044 --> 00:37:37,004
S.S. Sagafjord, 11th through the 29th.

528
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,423
Pair of tickets. I can't use them.

529
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:41,509
Can you take them off my hands?

530
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:43,803
- Where'd they come from?
- Comps.

531
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,222
Comps?

532
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:47,848
What does that mean?

533
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:50,851
As manager for the Kitchen
and Restaurant Workers Union...

534
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:54,480
...I administer the dental plan.
You listening to me?

535
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:58,359
A couple of dentists got together
and awarded me these tickets.

536
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:01,362
The problem is,
I can't get away those dates.

537
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:07,034
Here. When was your last vacation?

538
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:09,870
- Anthony, thank you.
- All right.

539
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:18,879
Mr. Soprano?

540
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:30,224
You cannot accept a gift
like that from Tony Soprano! No way!

541
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:31,726
Listen to me, Charmaine...

542
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:35,354
...if I stick my hand up the ass of
one more lobster without a break...

543
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:36,856
...I'm gonna go postal.

544
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:40,401
I don't even want to talk about it
anymore, please!

545
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:44,697
Art, Melissa, come on, honey.
It's time to go home.

546
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:49,243
You have to get away.
We have to get away for the marriage.

547
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:54,498
No! It's bad enough that these
mobsters patronize the place, okay?

548
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,500
So what? We're not connected.

549
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,712
Right. Because we just
turned down those tickets!

550
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:03,632
But the tickets were comps.
Tony is a labor leader.

551
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,551
Arthur, please. Grow up!

552
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:09,597
Does the mind not rebel at any
scenario under which dentists...

553
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:14,518
...are sending the don of New Jersey
first class on a Norwegian steamship?

554
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:18,606
Come on, Arthur, somebody donated
their kneecaps for those tickets!

555
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:22,818
Herman, there is no way I can
subvert my fucking company.

556
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:26,155
Have them pay claims for MRIs
that never happened?

557
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:29,909
- The paperwork will look real.
- How do I not get caught?

558
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:33,287
I hate to hear you knocking yourself.
You're a smart guy.

559
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:37,249
I'm depressed. I'm so fucking
depressed I can't eat, sleep.

560
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:40,294
- You on Prozac?
- Zoloft. It's similar.

561
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,838
- It's supposed to help with gambling.
- No shit.

562
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,341
This new generation
of antidepressants...

563
00:39:45,634 --> 00:39:48,594
...are supposed to be useful
against compulsive behaviors.

564
00:39:48,804 --> 00:39:50,096
That's a shame.

565
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:52,848
A medication comes along
after your gambling...

566
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:55,476
...gets your fucking hip
busted to shit.

567
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:57,937
I'm trying not to be cynical.

568
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:02,066
Your debt and the feelings surrounding
it is the source of all your problems.

569
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,819
I'm sorry I haven't paid you, Herman.

570
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,487
I know you are.

571
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:08,948
And I never meant to
denigrate Tony Soprano.

572
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:11,700
- Want to walk on the rocks?
- Crutches, I can't.

573
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:14,954
It's beautiful out there.
Come on, we'll help you.

574
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:16,831
I go out there to think.

575
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:33,180
Thanks, but no.

576
00:40:35,976 --> 00:40:37,351
Let's try it.

577
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:41,355
What you were saying before
with the MRIs and...

578
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:04,545
T!

579
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:08,132
Dick's looking for you!

580
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:12,887
Hey, Tony, I just heard
from Triborough Towers.

581
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,223
The Kolar brothers withdrew their bid.

582
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:17,725
That's good. That's good.

583
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:20,895
Listen, by the way,
Artie Bucco's here to see you.

584
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:23,439
- I gotta go, guys.
- Take care.

585
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,071
Artie!

586
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:33,365
Artie, you all right?

587
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:38,204
- I can't.
- What are you talking about?

588
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:41,290
We discussed this.
You gotta leave town.

589
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:42,791
I'm sorry.

590
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,301
This is unacceptable.

591
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:54,803
I made a reservation two weeks ago.

592
00:41:55,055 --> 00:41:59,058
Sir, people are not leaving, and there
are five parties ahead of you.

593
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:01,936
- So what would you like...?
- Can I help you?

594
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:06,440
I tore her a new one.

595
00:42:07,484 --> 00:42:10,444
Why don't we just go
to another restaurant and eat?

596
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:11,946
We're here.

597
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:14,615
Mr. Soprano, how you doing?
Good to see you.

598
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:16,283
How you doing?

599
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:18,202
- Signora.
- Hello.

600
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:20,287
This way. Excuse me.

601
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:29,004
Sweetie-pie, I'm hungry.
Tony, where you going?

602
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:30,965
Hey. How are you?

603
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:32,633
Good.

604
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:35,636
You come here?

605
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:37,596
When possible.

606
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:42,768
Those decorating tips you gave me,
they really work.

607
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:44,979
Good.

608
00:42:46,815 --> 00:42:47,982
How you doing?

609
00:42:52,821 --> 00:42:54,488
Nils, Nils?

610
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:56,282
Do you know who that was?

611
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:59,159
Well, I mean, obviously you do.

612
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:00,995
What, is he a patient?

613
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:02,621
You know I can't say.

614
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:09,378
Decorating tips, yeah, right.

615
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:11,672
Nils, shut the fuck up.

616
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:14,883
Mr. Borglund, they're setting up
your table now.

617
00:43:16,845 --> 00:43:18,012
Whoa.

618
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,849
Who was that woman at the restaurant?

619
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:23,517
My decorator.

620
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:26,186
What?
You're redoing the garbage dump?

621
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:29,690
That's funny. Hey, you better
not mess with that hat!

622
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:36,030
Come on, it's JFK's hat!
I bought it at that auction.

623
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:37,406
Give me that!

624
00:43:38,867 --> 00:43:40,367
Irina, Jesus.

625
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:44,705
I know there is something more
intimate between you and her.

626
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:47,207
Nothing intimate. We just talk.

627
00:43:57,427 --> 00:43:59,178
Mr. Soprano, buona sera.

628
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:01,388
We don't see you.
Where you been?

629
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,938
You know, sometimes...

630
00:44:11,066 --> 00:44:12,399
...life is good.

631
00:44:12,609 --> 00:44:14,568
Life is often good.

632
00:44:15,904 --> 00:44:18,072
Regaleali, for example.

633
00:44:19,908 --> 00:44:22,201
You've been in good spirits
the last couple days.

634
00:44:31,086 --> 00:44:35,089
Carmela, there's something
I gotta confess.

635
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,094
What are you doing?

636
00:44:40,345 --> 00:44:43,097
Getting my wine in position
to throw in your face!

637
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:44,598
You're always with the drama.

638
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:47,226
Confess already, please.
Get it over with!

639
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:53,774
I'm on Prozac.

640
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:56,610
Oh. Oh, my God.

641
00:44:57,404 --> 00:44:59,154
I been seeing a therapist.

642
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:02,116
Oh, my God.
I think that's great.

643
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:05,411
I think that's wonderful!
I think that's so gutsy!

644
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,414
- Take it easy.
- But I think that's very wonderful.

645
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:10,582
You'd think I was Hannibal Lecter.

646
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:13,419
I think it's great.
Psychology doesn't address the soul.

647
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:15,462
But this is a start.
This is something.

648
00:45:15,672 --> 00:45:17,589
Oh, I'm gonna shut up now.

649
00:45:18,133 --> 00:45:19,633
I'll shut up now.

650
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:21,927
You're the only person who knows.

651
00:45:22,137 --> 00:45:25,013
The only reason I'm telling you this
is because you're my wife.

652
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:28,642
You're the only person on this planet
that I'm completely honest with.

653
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:30,644
Oh, please.

654
00:45:30,812 --> 00:45:32,479
Hey, goddamn it, I'm serious.

655
00:45:32,814 --> 00:45:34,982
If the wrong person finds out,
I get a steel jacket...

656
00:45:35,275 --> 00:45:37,526
...of antidepressant
in the back of the head.

657
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,663
I didn't realize you were so unhappy.

658
00:45:53,668 --> 00:45:54,960
I don't know.

659
00:45:55,545 --> 00:45:57,171
My mother...

660
00:45:57,422 --> 00:45:59,214
You told him about your father, right?

661
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:02,176
- Who?
- Your therapist.

662
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:05,679
Yeah. Yeah, I told him.

663
00:46:05,847 --> 00:46:09,683
Good. But your mother is the one.

664
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:15,022
I don't know, I just feel like lately
my life's out of balance.

665
00:46:17,859 --> 00:46:21,361
Our existence on this earth
is a puzzle.

666
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:24,323
My own daughter hates me.

667
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:27,201
She doesn't hate you, Carm.

668
00:46:27,494 --> 00:46:29,203
We were best friends.

669
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:32,664
Mothers and their daughters.
She'll come back to you.

670
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:38,879
- Hello?
- Jesus!

671
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:41,048
What's the matter, no social life?

672
00:46:41,216 --> 00:46:42,716
Blow me.

673
00:46:44,052 --> 00:46:45,344
Dad.

674
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:48,889
I brought you my primavera.
It's your favorite.

675
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:51,892
- Who is it?
- Christopher.

676
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:54,520
- Hey.
- Our friend is back in town.

677
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:59,525
"Little Pussy" Malanga,
confused with "Big Pussy" Bompensiero...

678
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:01,610
...had just returned from Florida...

679
00:47:01,903 --> 00:47:03,862
So it's gonna go down soon?

680
00:47:04,072 --> 00:47:06,073
Don't worry.
I got a way to put it to bed.

681
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:09,535
Come on, Meadow.

682
00:47:10,245 --> 00:47:13,080
- Go, Falcons!
- Come on, let's go!

683
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:16,208
So when do you need this by?

684
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:17,876
Right away.

685
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:21,588
- Way to go, Meadow!
- Beautiful, beautiful!

686
00:47:22,257 --> 00:47:24,424
I think I can get a party
like that together.

687
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:28,262
- Side out? That ball hit the line!
- What are you doing, ref?

688
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:34,142
Mom didn't come?

689
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:36,436
Didn't think you wanted her to.

690
00:47:37,105 --> 00:47:38,772
The car's over there.

691
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:41,608
Hey, Mr. Dante.
See you, Heather.

692
00:47:42,819 --> 00:47:44,403
You guys played a good game.

693
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:46,446
Heather Dante.
Where'd she get that spike?

694
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:49,408
Don't you think it's
unfair what Mom is doing?

695
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:52,077
Making this little
movie scene out of it.

696
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:56,039
"The Sad Mom Who Can't Even Come
to Her Daughter's Sports Event."

697
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:03,797
Dad?

698
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:06,466
Don't you think it's
totally out there?

699
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:10,637
I mean, my Aspen trip.
What is she thinking?

700
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:13,098
Dad?

701
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:21,273
It's been years since I've been here.

702
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:24,067
Dad, please talk to her, please.

703
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,070
God, this is so stupid.

704
00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:29,489
Why are we sitting here?

705
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,369
Your mother thinks you have the
capacity to be a top student.

706
00:48:34,621 --> 00:48:35,829
And I agree.

707
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,831
What do you guys want, perfection?

708
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,669
What are you looking at?

709
00:48:43,171 --> 00:48:46,673
Your great-grandfather
and his brother Frank...

710
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:49,176
...they built this place.

711
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:51,094
Big whoop.

712
00:48:51,346 --> 00:48:54,514
Stone and marble workers.
They came over here from Italy...

713
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:57,517
...and they built this place.

714
00:48:58,811 --> 00:49:01,355
Yeah, right. Two guys.

715
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:07,527
No, they were two guys on a crew of,
you know, laborers.

716
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:12,616
They didn't design it...

717
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:15,035
...but they knew how to build it.

718
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:20,374
Now find two guys who can
put decent grout around your bathtub.

719
00:49:58,037 --> 00:49:59,413
So I feel good.

720
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:03,041
So I don't know if I'm
gonna be needing to come back.

721
00:50:03,543 --> 00:50:05,419
It's not the Prozac.

722
00:50:05,962 --> 00:50:07,254
Why not?

723
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:12,592
You said you're thinking clearer and
your wife says you seem to be better?

724
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:15,929
It's not the medication.

725
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:21,727
Prozac takes weeks to build up
effective levels in the blood.

726
00:50:23,271 --> 00:50:24,604
Well, what is it, then?

727
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:28,066
Coming here. Talking.

728
00:50:29,402 --> 00:50:31,778
Hope comes in many forms.

729
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:34,114
Well, who's got time for that?

730
00:50:34,741 --> 00:50:36,742
What is it you want to say to me?

731
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:48,295
I had a dream last night.

732
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:52,466
Uh...

733
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:57,012
My bellybutton was...

734
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:00,140
...a Phillips head screw...

735
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:03,310
...and I'm working unscrewing it...

736
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:05,979
...and when I get it unscrewed...

737
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:10,484
...my penis falls off.

738
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:19,159
You know, I pick it up and I'm holding
it and I'm running around...

739
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:22,829
...looking for the guy who used to
work on my Lincoln...

740
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:25,499
...so he can put it back on.

741
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:28,960
And you know, I'm holding it up...

742
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:33,131
...and this bird swoops down
and grabs it in its beak...

743
00:51:34,175 --> 00:51:35,967
...and flies off with it.

744
00:51:40,515 --> 00:51:42,015
What kind of bird?

745
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:46,186
I don't know. Sea gull or something.

746
00:51:46,354 --> 00:51:47,771
A water bird?

747
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:52,067
I saw The Birds last week.
Think that planted the idea?

748
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:54,194
What else is a water bird?

749
00:51:55,321 --> 00:51:58,198
Pelican, flamingo.

750
00:51:58,991 --> 00:52:00,534
What about ducks?

751
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:09,000
Those goddamn ducks.

752
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:12,212
What is it about those ducks
that meant so much to you?

753
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:21,096
I don't know, it was a trip...

754
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:25,684
...having those wild creatures...

755
00:52:26,435 --> 00:52:29,896
...come into my pool
and have their little babies.

756
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:38,822
I was sad to see them go.

757
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:43,910
Oh, Jesus, fuck. Now he's gonna cry.

758
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:54,421
Shit. Fuck me.

759
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:59,759
When the ducks gave birth to those
babies, they became a family.

760
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:05,640
You're right.

761
00:53:06,434 --> 00:53:08,935
It's a link. A connection.

762
00:53:09,729 --> 00:53:12,731
I'm afraid I'm gonna
lose my family...

763
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:14,900
...like I lost the ducks.

764
00:53:17,278 --> 00:53:19,905
That's what I'm full of dread about.

765
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:23,575
It's always with me.

766
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:26,119
What are you so afraid's
going to happen?

767
00:53:27,455 --> 00:53:28,872
I don't know.

768
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:36,379
You work so hard.

769
00:53:36,631 --> 00:53:40,967
You work so damn hard
and to see your life's dream...

770
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:44,095
...burn down.

771
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:47,265
Look at it this way,
you collect the insurance.

772
00:53:47,475 --> 00:53:50,602
You gotta say to yourself,
"It could have been worse."

773
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:54,522
How could it have been worse?
Fucking faulty stove!

774
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:57,817
Suppose people stopped coming,
ever think of that?

775
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:02,155
I don't know.
I don't know what the fuck.

776
00:54:04,617 --> 00:54:06,826
He's right.
There's no insurance for that.

777
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:11,706
Why would people stop coming to the
restaurant? It's just catching on.

778
00:54:12,959 --> 00:54:15,168
You know what I'm
figuring out lately?

779
00:54:16,629 --> 00:54:18,296
Talking helps.

780
00:54:18,506 --> 00:54:20,632
- That's right.
- He's right. He's right.

781
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:27,347
Hope... comes in many forms.

782
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:29,182
Absolutely.

783
00:54:29,642 --> 00:54:30,850
Come on.

784
00:54:32,687 --> 00:54:34,062
Here, hold this.

785
00:54:34,313 --> 00:54:35,563
Artie.

786
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:37,857
Artie, come on.

787
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:39,192
Hey, hey.

788
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:41,861
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

789
00:54:42,697 --> 00:54:44,531
I'll always help you.

790
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:47,200
Come on. Come on.

791
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:55,333
Go cook. Hey, let him cook.
He'll feel better.

792
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:11,224
Someday I'll tell him
we torched the restaurant.

793
00:55:16,731 --> 00:55:19,399
All right, enough of this shit.
What's wrong?

794
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:22,402
You know, a simple...

795
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:26,489
..."Way to go, Chris, on the Triborough
Towers contract!" would have been nice.

796
00:55:26,741 --> 00:55:28,074
That's it.

797
00:55:37,418 --> 00:55:38,626
You're right.

798
00:55:39,128 --> 00:55:40,503
You're right.

799
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:43,131
I have no defense.

800
00:55:43,758 --> 00:55:48,136
That's how I was parented.
Never supported. Never complimented.

801
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:50,555
My cousin Gregory's girlfriend...

802
00:55:50,765 --> 00:55:53,933
...is what they call a development
girl, out in Hollywood.

803
00:55:54,143 --> 00:55:56,895
She said I could sell my life story,
make fucking millions.

804
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:59,898
I didn't do that.
I stuck it out with you.

805
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:03,943
I'll fucking kill you.
Are you gonna go Henry Hill on me now?

806
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,280
You know how many mobsters are selling
screenplays and screwing things up?

807
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:09,657
She said I could maybe
even play myself.

808
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,451
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

809
00:56:15,331 --> 00:56:19,626
Forget Hollywood screenplays.
Forget those distractions, huh?

810
00:56:21,087 --> 00:56:23,171
What, you think I haven't had offers?

811
00:56:25,674 --> 00:56:28,802
We got work to do. New avenues.

812
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:33,181
Everything's gonna be all right
from here on in. Come on.

813
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:37,811
Look, it's a beautiful day.
What could be bad?

814
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:43,650
It's nice of you to pick me up
for the party, Junior.

815
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:47,946
- At least somebody cares about me.
- These kids today.

816
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:51,658
I suppose he thinks once he's
got me in a nursing home...

817
00:56:51,951 --> 00:56:56,663
...I'll die faster and then
he won't have to drive me anywhere.

818
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:59,082
If his father was still alive...

819
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:04,087
...you can bet he'd show more
decency and respect for his mother.

820
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:07,382
Well, my brother John
was a man among men.

821
00:57:08,843 --> 00:57:10,218
He was a saint.

822
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:14,180
Lots of things are different now
from Johnny's and my day.

823
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:15,515
What do you mean?

824
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:18,226
I'm not free to run my business
like I want.

825
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:19,853
Aw, isn't that awful.

826
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:21,896
Just this week, your son
stuck his hand in...

827
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:24,315
...and made it 100 times
more difficult for me.

828
00:57:24,525 --> 00:57:26,609
Plus, he thumbs his nose at New York.

829
00:57:27,695 --> 00:57:31,197
What are you gonna do?
He's part of a whole generation.

830
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:35,160
Do you remember the crazy hair?
And the dope?

831
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:36,703
Now it's fags in the military.

832
00:57:36,871 --> 00:57:39,747
Stop it, Junior.
You're making me very upset!

833
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:43,251
I don't like to, Livia,
but I'm agita all the time.

834
00:57:43,711 --> 00:57:47,213
And I'll tell you something else,
things are down all across the board.

835
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:49,757
A lot of friends of ours
are complaining.

836
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:53,511
We used to be recession-proof.
No more.

837
00:57:54,346 --> 00:57:57,265
You can't blame it all
on the Justice Department.

838
00:57:58,893 --> 00:58:00,643
Our friends say to me...

839
00:58:00,895 --> 00:58:05,565
..."Junior, why don't you
take a larger hand in things?"

840
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:11,905
Something may have to be done, Livia,
about Tony.

841
00:58:12,865 --> 00:58:14,157
I don't know.

842
00:58:21,749 --> 00:58:23,541
There they are.
Hey, Ma, Uncle Jun.

843
00:58:23,751 --> 00:58:28,588
You're using mesquite.
That makes the sausage taste peculiar.

844
00:58:28,797 --> 00:58:32,300
- Hi, Grandma.
- Happy birthday, my big boy.

845
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:33,927
Carmela, my mother's here.

846
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:36,679
Everybody, let's eat.


1
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:08,799
John Gotti, life in prison...

2
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:11,218
...no chance of parole.

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,724
We've seen prosecutions in Florida
and elsewhere of top Mob figures.

4
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,185
What are you doing?
Put that back.

5
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:27,359
What's the situation on the ground
today, right now, in the Mob?

6
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:28,527
Confusion...

7
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:30,612
...instability...

8
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:33,532
- ...vacuum at the top.
- What caused it?

9
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:35,617
Your sister's ass.

10
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,162
Policy over two decades...

11
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,080
...to behead the crime families.

12
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,750
But wasn't it, at least in part...

13
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,961
...a disregard
within the Mob itself...

14
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:50,049
...of the rules that served
the old dons so well?

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,342
- If the shoe fits.
- No doubt.

16
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,220
Sil. Cheer me up, babe.

17
00:00:56,222 --> 00:01:00,684
Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in.

18
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,730
Is that Pacino or is that Pacino?
Spitting image.

19
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,899
- Vincent Rizzo.
- Yes.

20
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,860
Former soldier in the Genovese family.

21
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,988
Government witness
turned best-selling author.

22
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,449
Do you agree with U.S. Attorney Braun?

23
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:16,909
The party's over.

24
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:20,704
- He is a wiseguy. Elaborate.
- It's not like it was.

25
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:23,373
- Cloning.
- Mexicans are huge in that.

26
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,585
- Fascinating.
- Because they work as parking valets.

27
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,630
Do I mean that organized crime...

28
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:34,009
...will go the way of the dodo bird?

29
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,847
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- Mexicans.

30
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,933
- What about them?
- Cell phones.

31
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,936
I'm not talking
about cloning cell phones.

32
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,730
I'm talking about fucking sheep!
Science.

33
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,358
I tell my kids,
"Only God can make a life."

34
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:53,403
A guy here asks, "What if they had
cloned Princess Di?"

35
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:57,366
But you know, the heydey?
You know, the Golden Age...

36
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,076
...or whatever, of the Mob?

37
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,702
That's gone.

38
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,122
And that's never coming back.

39
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,834
They have only themselves to blame.

40
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,461
They pay this chiacchierone
by the word?

41
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:11,046
Drug trafficking.

42
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,841
- Oh!
- I think it ruined everything.

43
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,386
You're looking at a mandatory
35 to life in prison.

44
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,806
Guys started to rat
so they could avoid prosecution.

45
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,433
What's going on
with that Princess Di?

46
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:27,187
Do you think the royal family
had her whacked?

47
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,107
Last time I take a limo in Paris.

48
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,984
Like you were ever in Paris.

49
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,735
I went for a blowjob.

50
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,115
Your mother was working the bonbon
concession at the Eiffel Tower.

51
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,618
You hear what I told him?
"I went over for a blowjob.

52
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,955
Your mother was working
at the Eiffel Tower."

53
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,624
I got a list of people
I wouldn't want cloned.

54
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:51,461
The mayor of New York, that's
the guy least likely to get cloned.

55
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:56,425
So the code of silence, the omertá,
or whatever, just went by the boards.

56
00:02:56,676 --> 00:03:00,762
You're always gonna have
organized crime. Always.

57
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:04,349
As long as the human being
has certain appetites...

58
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,227
...for gambling, pornography
or whatever.

59
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:11,190
Someone's always gonna surface
to serve these needs. Always.

60
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:15,861
Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in.

61
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,934
- You got DVD players?
- Don't hurt me.

62
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,854
Only people who get hurt
are the jerk-offs.

63
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,148
Now step down, nice and easy.

64
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,234
He's got the DVD players.

65
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,528
Quick and painless.
Not to hurt you.

66
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,196
You gotta tie me up.

67
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,241
- You gonna be a jerk-off?
- My boss'll think I'm in on it.

68
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:29,703
We look like we want a merit badge?
We travel with rope?

69
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,998
I've got some in the cab.
Please, I need this job.

70
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,458
Okay, get the rope.

71
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:39,046
I don't know who gave the route,
but there's no way I'd go unscathed...

72
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,340
- ...without being fired.
- You want to be scathed?

73
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,468
So it looks like I didn't
give up without a struggle.

74
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,391
- Oh!
- That's cool. Thank you.

75
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:53,894
That's enough.

76
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,854
No, wait.

77
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:57,939
Oh!

78
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,942
Ow! That's good!

79
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,194
- Scathed?
- Scathed.

80
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,695
He's scathed.

81
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,578
Mr. Miller, my science teacher,
he got his car stolen.

82
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,164
You're kidding.
From where? His house?

83
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,000
Mm-mm. His parking spot at school.

84
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,544
A Saturn. He only had it a year.

85
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,713
The security people are a joke.

86
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:26,051
Did you hear what A.J. just said?
Mr. Miller's car got stolen.

87
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,470
Refresh my memory. Who is he?

88
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,390
He's your son's science teacher.

89
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,644
You're up early.

90
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,063
He just bought that car a year ago.

91
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,731
So? Insurance will pay.

92
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,691
They don't give full value.

93
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,319
These poor teachers,
they don't make a lot.

94
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,030
So he can work his summer vacation.

95
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,533
You could help find it.

96
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:53,453
I thought I told you I changed my name
from LoJack to Soprano.

97
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,455
Laugh. I'd pee in my pants.

98
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,542
Pussy's got the body shop.
He couldn't ask?

99
00:06:58,793 --> 00:06:59,960
I'm late.

100
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:03,839
- What are you getting in science?
- D-plus.

101
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,218
- See what I can do.
- That's not what I meant.

102
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,679
He's gotta work for his grades.

103
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,024
I'm going back to bed.

104
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,026
- Bye, Dad.
- See you later.

105
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,947
Here, eat this.

106
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,624
Technology comes to the Bing!

107
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,918
Hey, where you been?

108
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,130
- Come on.
- Let's go.

109
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,299
- Hey, is the load here?
- Yeah.

110
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,512
If Serge calls, I'll be back.

111
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:56,600
These new phones, hold, conference,
sometimes I get confused.

112
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,768
How complicated is it?

113
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,437
Answer the phone, take the message.

114
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,273
Voice mail only comes on
if you let it ring.

115
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,066
Jesus Christ, Georgie.

116
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,620
I hear there's not as many titles
as on laser.

117
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:17,913
There's more coming.

118
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,082
My internist said the picture's
not that different.

119
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,502
But the sound...
Way improved.

120
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:28,632
Good. Nothing beats popping up some
corn and listening to Men in Black.

121
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,551
- Fuck it!
- It's the damn wires, that's all!

122
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:34,346
I'll hook it up.
I used to be an installer.

123
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,770
Why can't you be nice to Brendan?

124
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,647
We discussed that.

125
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,694
I was gonna come looking.
It's the guy.

126
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,154
It's Serge?

127
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,989
I'll take it over there.

128
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,705
Serge?

129
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,419
Press "hold" when you transfer a call.

130
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,004
I'm sorry, Tony.

131
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,094
Now he's not gonna call back.

132
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:17,931
Brendan's a good earner, T.
This jack was his plan.

133
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,350
He's a good kid,
but I don't like meth.

134
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,189
Fuck, I gotta call my mother.

135
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,115
- Hello?
- Hello, Ma?

136
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:38,577
Oh, look who calls.

137
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,746
- How you doing?
- I was wondering when you'd call.

138
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,542
You can stop wondering now.
This is it, I'm calling you.

139
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:49,254
I called yesterday.
You were supposed to call me back.

140
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,132
I phoned your house.

141
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:56,094
Some operator answered. I couldn't
understand a word she was saying.

142
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:59,598
That's not an operator,
that's an answering machine.

143
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,851
Oh, fancy, fancy.

144
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,396
Here, let me turn the heat off
under these mushrooms.

145
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,903
You and Mom are like peas in a pod.

146
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,741
She can't master the phone,
but she's 70. What's your excuse?

147
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,417
What is she doing now?

148
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,843
Oh, my God.

149
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,472
- Oh, my God.
- Ma!

150
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,725
Ma!

151
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,521
Hey, Ma!

152
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:54,444
- Oh, my God!
- Ma!

153
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:55,779
Where is she?

154
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,782
- Who is this?
- It's Anthony!

155
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,201
The mushrooms, they're on fire!

156
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,079
Get the fire extinguisher
under the sink!

157
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,457
Oh, my God!
The wall's getting all black!

158
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,584
Ma, hang up and call 911.

159
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,670
The guy's on the second line.

160
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,964
- Aren't you coming over?
- You press "hold," goddamn it.

161
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,509
I can't, I'm 40 minutes away.

162
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,595
You hang up and you call 911.
Leave the house.

163
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,431
Look at how I live!

164
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,433
Ma, hang up and call 911.

165
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,236
My mother's got a fire in the kitchen.

166
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,447
- Oh, my God.
- She's calling 911. Go there.

167
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,951
- I'm on my way.
- Thank you, baby. I know you're busy.

168
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,079
Serge, Serge.

169
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,414
I can't talk now.

170
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,542
I gotta go to an outside line.

171
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,754
All right. I'll call you back.

172
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,506
Is your mom okay?

173
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,383
Shit cannot go on like this.

174
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,345
Hey, T. Hey, T.

175
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:06,099
This teacher, his car,
you got a plate number?

176
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,810
Call my wife.

177
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,817
- Have a nice day.
- Thanks.

178
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,360
No problem.

179
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,119
Ma.

180
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:30,540
I wish you'd let me
get somebody to help you.

181
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:34,043
- You shouldn't be alone.
- Help me what?

182
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,339
- With the housework.
- I have my ways.

183
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:42,510
A stranger could care less
about doing it right.

184
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,182
Can I tell you something though, Ma?
You need company.

185
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,769
Don't start with that nursing-home
business again.

186
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,647
This is not a nursing home.
It is a retirement community.

187
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:05,325
You want me to make you pastina?
Something in your stomach?

188
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,332
Ma, now, I've told Tony...

189
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:16,169
...and I've told you many times.

190
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,505
You can come live with us.

191
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,591
I know when I'm not wanted!

192
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:28,014
I invited you to share my home.
If you want me to beg, that's different.

193
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:34,729
Leave this place
that my husband and I shared?

194
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,107
Well, change can be a positive.

195
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,194
He was a saint.

196
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:49,327
That son of mine, is he
still having those fits?

197
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:54,749
They're not fits, Ma.
They're anxiety attacks.

198
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,876
You know, he's on medication.

199
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,469
What BMW's charging us for paint?
O trippa di zia.

200
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,224
- It's been that way for six months.
- When was I last here?

201
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,352
Hey.

202
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,939
We maybe caught a break.

203
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,861
Watchung Avenue said some guys brought
a Saturn trying to load it for parts.

204
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,739
Are you saying this car's for Tony
and leave it all in one piece?

205
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,784
Yeah, sure.
It's for the kid's teacher.

206
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:35,540
My guy said one of those goofballs
had a uniform on from Buttfucks.

207
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,502
Whatever, the coffee shop.
I guess the guy works there.

208
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,004
Watchung and what?

209
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,551
I'm fucking Rockford here.

210
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:54,934
Decaf cappuccino Primo, non-fat
Magnifico, double espresso regulare.

211
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,269
I'll take you here.

212
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:02,942
I think I'll have an espresso.
Paul, you want anything?

213
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,694
They got any just coffee?

214
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,363
Our café du jour
is New Zealand Peaberry.

215
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,366
Madonna. Whatever.

216
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,327
That's $4.20. Pick up there.

217
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,246
One medium du jour,
one single espresso.

218
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,706
Here, keep it.

219
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,834
Honey, let me ask you.

220
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,713
My wife was in the body shop around
the corner the other day.

221
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:28,384
The guy in front of her leaves
and she sees he dropped...

222
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,094
...his money clip.

223
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,556
But he was already gone.
We'd like to give it back.

224
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:37,435
She said he was wearing
a uniform like that there.

225
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,480
Real black hair.
Tall? Little earring.

226
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,565
These stores are everywhere.

227
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,859
Yeah, tell me about it.

228
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,992
Fucking Italian people.
How'd we miss out on this?

229
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:56,579
- What?
- Fucking espresso, cappuccino.

230
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,124
We invent it and these
cocksuckers are getting rich.

231
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,668
Isn't it amazing?

232
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,170
It's not just money.
It's a pride thing.

233
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:08,591
All our food, pizza,
calzone, buffalo mozzarella...

234
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,801
...olive oil.

235
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,761
These fucks had nothing.

236
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,889
They ate puzzi before
we gave them our cuisine.

237
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:18,977
But this, this is the worst.
This espresso shit.

238
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,186
Take it easy.

239
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:25,525
She finally agreed
to have somebody come in days.

240
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:30,905
Carmela called an agency, and they
sent over this Trinidadian woman.

241
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,618
But no matter what I do,
I feel guilty.

242
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:36,911
Why?

243
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,501
The real reason is,
I can't let her live with us.

244
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:47,130
That doesn't seem practical,
given her personality.

245
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,843
Well, it's my wife.
She won't allow it.

246
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,178
Where are your sisters in this?

247
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:58,683
They cut it off with her long ago.
No way she's bunking with them.

248
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:03,312
So you're carrying all this guilt
when your mother is clearly someone...

249
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,899
...who has difficulty maintaining
any relationship.

250
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,195
But she's my mother.

251
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:15,491
You're supposed to take care of your
mother. She's a little old lady.

252
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,285
Not to you.

253
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,078
She's very powerful.

254
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,580
Bullshit.

255
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,291
You accord this "little old lady"...

256
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,544
...an almost mystical ability
to wreak havoc.

257
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:30,381
Let me tell you. You definitely
don't want to get her started.

258
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,511
There are some people who are not
ideal candidates for parenthood.

259
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,931
Come on. She's an old sweetie-pie.

260
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:43,728
What were some of the good
experiences you remember as a child?

261
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,688
The loving warm ones?

262
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,411
One time we were down at the shore.

263
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,873
About '68, '69, the whole family.

264
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:09,170
My father, he tripped and fell down
the stairs, and we were all laughing.

265
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:13,091
The whole family was laughing.
My mother was laughing.

266
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,261
Any other loving experiences?

267
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,722
Hey, she's a good woman.

268
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,558
She put food on the table every night.

269
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:27,313
I'm the ungrateful fuck.
I come here, complain about her...

270
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,858
...and I let my wife exclude her
from my home.

271
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,499
Hey, Ma!

272
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,046
- You Perrilyn?
- Yes.

273
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,214
Tony Soprano.

274
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,632
Ah.

275
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,593
- How you doing?
- I'm fine.

276
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:04,475
Oh, Livia, your son is here!
And isn't he a handsome thing.

277
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,562
And look what he brought.

278
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:13,442
All right, listen.
Let's get one thing straight.

279
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:18,614
In the hours you're here taking care
of my mother, no ganja. Okay?

280
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:22,160
Hey, Ma, fiori.

281
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:27,373
I'm not dead, unfortunately for some.

282
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,084
The tall ones are delphiniums.

283
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:33,045
You know, Frankie Valli
when he visits Jersey?

284
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,423
This is the florist he uses.

285
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,508
Aren't they beautiful?

286
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,927
Want me to put them on the table?

287
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,848
You make sure the bottom
of the vase isn't wet.

288
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,976
Mr. Tony, would you like
some tea or something?

289
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,478
Coke, thanks.

290
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,195
So how's it going today?

291
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,364
She's stealing.

292
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,366
Who?

293
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,702
That ditsoon, who.

294
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:10,124
That beautiful plate Aunt Settimia
took from that restaurant in Rome.

295
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,292
It's gone.

296
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,421
I don't know.
She seems like a nice person.

297
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,174
She doesn't fool me for a second.

298
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,264
You sure she stole it?

299
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,310
You didn't give it
to one of the relatives?

300
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:33,898
You keep forcing your possessions
on people, thinking you're gonna die.

301
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,108
I wish it was tomorrow.

302
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,031
And she's so forward too.
Who does she think she is?

303
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,493
She's happy, Ma. She's singing.

304
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,162
Anthony, I don't want her around here.

305
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,581
I can manage somehow.

306
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,209
No, I'm not giving in
to you this time.

307
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,378
She stays.

308
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,595
Your uncle called here
looking for you.

309
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,180
Uncle Jun?

310
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,391
He sounded agitated.

311
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,939
Jackie, tell them to leave
Comley trucking alone.

312
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,900
Didn't know it was a Comley truck.

313
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,697
For 21 fucking years, Comley's put
food on my table, protection money.

314
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,866
- Chris didn't know going in.
- Bullshit.

315
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,911
Want my DVD?
You can watch Grumpy Old Men.

316
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:31,497
- You gonna be a fucking funny boy now?
- Hey!

317
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,749
You Sopranos.

318
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:38,838
You hope you and your uncle can settle,
not be invited to a fucking sit-down.

319
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,465
You got a crew of cowards
you don't control.

320
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,175
Here we go.
Here we go.

321
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,635
You got a ruling?

322
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,435
The kids make restitution to Junior.

323
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,020
Done. It's done.

324
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,319
Christopher Moltisanti's
a fucking loose...

325
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,195
You get him out of a sick bed?

326
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,697
Hey, fuck that shit.

327
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:11,912
Giacomino, how you feeling?

328
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:16,334
I may be acting boss while your old
man's a guest of the government...

329
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,837
...but I wish somebody'd tell
my bowels. They don't obey.

330
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,382
Ah, the fucking chemo.

331
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,179
Maybe I should name a successor.

332
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:31,015
This day and age?
Who wants the fucking job?

333
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:36,520
Your mom tells me you got
a girl coming in to help.

334
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:38,814
That's good.

335
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:43,194
All right, I gotta go.

336
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,113
I'll see you soon.

337
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,701
We okay?

338
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,161
All right.

339
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,417
The smoke he hires for his own mother.

340
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,256
Hey, Mikey, how's the boy?

341
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,342
- What boy?
- The one you sleep with.

342
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,219
Oh.

343
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:09,595
I'm just kidding.

344
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,180
How's Jun treating you?

345
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:15,726
We're covering our nut. Your nephew
retarded? Likes to play with trucks?

346
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,646
What if Jerry Lewis heard
you talking like that?

347
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,565
No, that's muscular dystrophy, Tony.

348
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:26,153
Too bad they don't have a telethon
for fuckface-itis. They find a cure?

349
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,280
I'm just kidding you.

350
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:31,158
Come on, you're a good sport.
You all right?

351
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,077
- Yeah.
- You all right?

352
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,329
- Yeah.
- I'll see you later.

353
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,253
- Double cappuccino suprema.
- Double cappuccino suprema.

354
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,382
Thanks. Excuse me.

355
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:50,970
A guy fitting the description
does work in this branch.

356
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:54,849
His name is Edguardo Arnaz.
Him and his gay lover both work here.

357
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,809
And I got the address.

358
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,397
- Paulie, are you listening to me?
- Yeah.

359
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,108
Again with the rape of the culture.

360
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:07,695
Can we go find these Spice Girls
and get this over with?

361
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,658
Two small café du jours.

362
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,672
That's it!

363
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,466
What happened?

364
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,051
Beats me.

365
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,095
Did you say something to her?

366
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,140
I know how to talk to people.

367
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,267
These blacks.

368
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:41,228
Who knows what they'll
take the wrong way.

369
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,855
So she's gone!

370
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,819
Traffic and weather
on this Tuesday morning.

371
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:55,534
There's a delay as you
get out of the Lincoln Tunnel.

372
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:59,371
About a 25-minute delay if you're
approaching near Deer Route 3.

373
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,791
The queue beginning just before
the Bergen Viaduct.

374
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,795
You had orders. Why didn't you
pay his restitution?

375
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:11,091
Restitution, okay. But you
know how much your uncle wants? $15.

376
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:14,386
You got the wrong truck,
that's what happened.

377
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:21,936
I didn't notice you rushing
to give back your fucking DVD player.

378
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,938
I'm enjoying it very much.

379
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:27,816
I screened The Bank Dick last night.
"Did you warble, my little wren?"

380
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,527
I'm not gonna pay it.

381
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,321
- Oh, yeah?
- I'm serious.

382
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,157
Serious is what happens
if you don't pay, by me.

383
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:40,037
In my thoughts, I use the technique
of positive visualization.

384
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:42,373
How come I always feel undermined?

385
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:47,753
By what I did on the Triborough Towers
alone, I should've been made. Boom!

386
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:49,463
Hmm.

387
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,465
I'm fucking serious, Tony.

388
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,008
The books are closed.

389
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,261
Did you talk to Jackie about me?

390
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:59,098
They're not accepting
any new members, okay?

391
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:04,228
You know, you got a reputation
for immaturity...

392
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:08,274
...and it's not helping, not paying
the tributes the acting boss demands.

393
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,276
Acting boss, my ass.

394
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:14,863
Everybody knows you really run things
since Jackie became the "chemo-sabi."

395
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,868
Open the fucking door.
Open the fucking door!

396
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:26,208
Ow. Oh.

397
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,713
All right.

398
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,715
All right. Fuck it.

399
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,466
But 15 grand is too much!

400
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,135
I'll tell you what.

401
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,556
You give me the 15K,
I'll talk to Uncle Junior...

402
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:43,225
...and maybe I can get it
to around 10.

403
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,235
One more thing.

404
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:57,615
You leave Comley Trucking and every
other item that belongs to Jun...

405
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:01,785
...including his hemorrhoid doughnut,
the fuck alone. Got it?

406
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,079
Yeah.

407
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,759
"Did you warble, my little wren?"

408
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,094
What will his commission will be?

409
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,597
Two, three grand. Ten to Junior.

410
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,933
We're lucky we net 500 bucks
from the whole thing.

411
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,227
Ah!

412
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,280
Who is it?

413
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,283
What?

414
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,044
Mr. Arnaz?

415
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,629
What do you want?

416
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,840
You seen a schoolteacher's
Saturn around here?

417
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,637
Come here!

418
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,099
Anybody else here, Desi?

419
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,893
- Eddie, I'm ready.
- Yep.

420
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,228
Here comes Lucy.

421
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:12,231
Those people at the airport
shuttle are always late.

422
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,191
- Uh!
- Eddie!

423
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,819
You boys drove off in the wrong car.

424
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,988
We ain't saying shit
until there's an attorney.

425
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,741
Well, go ahead. Make a statement.

426
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:25,035
I got fucking Johnny Cochran here!

427
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,633
You boys put a crimp in my week.

428
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,720
- Ah, mannaggia!
- Get over there.

429
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,890
Hey, Puss, here's the fucking set.

430
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:49,351
Look.

431
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,438
Fucking car's been chopped. Useless.

432
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,731
That's not it.

433
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:57,234
Then why is that car inside there?
That Dodge?

434
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:01,780
Why is that motherfucker wearing the
fucking plate number I had all week?

435
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:04,575
- I don't know.
- Here's what's gonna happen.

436
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:08,704
The two of youse are climbing over that
fence and shagging those plates.

437
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,497
But the razor wire.

438
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:15,878
Then one of you stays with us while
the other goes and gets another Saturn.

439
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:27,806
- On the lookout for ducks?
- Know the old man pretty good.

440
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:31,935
Don't look so sad. Remember how
pissed you were about the pool filter?

441
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:37,149
They were special, them coming here,
huh? Don't you think?

442
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,650
I wasn't into it.

443
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,907
What time's Grandma getting here?

444
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,409
She had to drive
Fanny to the doctor's.

445
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,996
Then she is picking up my parents
and they're coming here.

446
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,249
They're each bringing
some antipasto.

447
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:59,296
I complain about my mother,
about how she just sits at home...

448
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,964
...and feels sorry for herself.

449
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:06,011
But she's always ready to drive those
friends of hers that can't drive.

450
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,432
I'm proud of her. It gives me hope.

451
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,622
It's getting chilly out here.

452
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:37,543
Make plenty of noise
before you open the front door.

453
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,920
You never know who's in there.

454
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:43,924
There's my Star-Ledger. Thanks.

455
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:48,929
Oh, this street,
another pain in the ass.

456
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:56,228
She broke her wrist
on the steering column.

457
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,063
A minor concussion.

458
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,649
What about the other woman?

459
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:03,861
Hip.

460
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:10,617
We were at the hospital till 2 a.m...

461
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:15,998
...talking to her doctor
and the staff gerontoligist.

462
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,750
They say she shouldn't
live alone anymore.

463
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:24,172
She can't manage the telephone.

464
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:28,844
Yet you say she's healthy and alert.

465
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,263
Like a bull.

466
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:33,765
Why?

467
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,268
I'm just thinking.

468
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:41,398
I know there are other doctors there,
but you know from your own life...

469
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:46,111
...that depression can cause
accidents, poor performance or worse.

470
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:48,155
So, what are you saying?

471
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,657
Unconsciously she tried
to whack her friend?

472
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:55,245
It's interesting that you would even
take that from what I said.

473
00:31:57,123 --> 00:32:01,168
Either way, she could need a change
in her living situation...

474
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:02,711
...be around more people.

475
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,297
We were looking at Green Grove.

476
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:06,965
It's a beautiful facility.

477
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:12,054
It's more like a hotel
at Cap d'Antibes.

478
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,265
Yeah.

479
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:21,146
- But to her it's a nursing home.
- She needs to see the distinction.

480
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:25,484
That, in fact, she's embarking
on a rewarding chapter.

481
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:30,572
I know seniors who are inspired
and inspiring.

482
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,413
You're not forgetting us, buddy?

483
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,167
Ladies.

484
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,759
Hey, Kenny Portugal said
to say hello.

485
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,594
Oh, yeah. Kenny.

486
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,267
The fuck is with this cocksucker?

487
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,604
Back up! Mr. Scorsese, good evening.

488
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:05,482
Whoa! Wow!

489
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,401
Marty!

490
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,528
Kundun! I liked it.

491
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,790
So my boy at Comley...

492
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,710
...said there's a load
of Italian suits.

493
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:28,672
Those unload fast.
Mario'll take the whole load.

494
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:32,217
He says shipment moves
Thursday at 6 a.m.

495
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:38,682
Give me one good reason
I should not jack this truck.

496
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:43,645
It's Junior's own fault. He gives us
no choice except to do it again.

497
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,689
Taking that outrageous tribute.

498
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:50,193
He shits on our heads, we're
supposed to say thanks for the hat.

499
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:54,489
I'm getting nowhere playing
by the rules. Fuck Tony.

500
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,867
"The books are closed." Blow me.

501
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,326
That's some true shit.

502
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:01,621
They're not confirming any
new made guys. How come?

503
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:05,542
Fucking chaos. Nobody knows
who's running things anymore.

504
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:10,380
Guys don't know who to make payments
up the ladder to in some cases.

505
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:14,009
I'm talking about the year 2000.
The millennium.

506
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,636
Where do we go from here?

507
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:26,938
Oh.

508
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:29,900
Ma, this Virginia ham...

509
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,486
Go on, get yourself some more.

510
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:34,488
No, I'm full.

511
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,239
It's good, though.

512
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,076
You never let me feed you.

513
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:45,040
So getting back
to what we were talking about.

514
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,084
- You want that lamp?
- Lie down.

515
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:52,089
That lamp, that's real ormolu. You
know what that's worth when it's new?

516
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,591
We're fixed good lamp-wise, thank you.

517
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,968
Take it and take the Barcalounger.

518
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:01,890
Somebody's gotta take
this stuff before I die.

519
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:05,602
Otherwise there's gonna be
a lot of stuff here...

520
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,897
...that the junkman's gonna
have to cart off to the dump.

521
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:14,152
Mom, you're not gonna die. Your
stuff won't be hauled off to the dump.

522
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:18,782
Plan for the future. The most rewarding
chapter of your life's coming up.

523
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:23,161
- You know my good jewelry?
- The stuff Dad gave you.

524
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,915
Some of those pieces came right
out of Cartier's window.

525
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,835
Listen, Carm doesn't want it.

526
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,628
Not now.

527
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:36,967
We want you to live long and wear your
sparklers to grandkids' graduations.

528
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,928
I gave it all
to your cousin Josephine.

529
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,848
The fuck?
The good jewelry?

530
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,058
She always admired it.

531
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,977
They don't have much.

532
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:51,148
You gave her Cartier rings,
and you give me a vibrating chair?

533
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:55,110
Your wife never showed
any interest in my jewels.

534
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:58,864
She never complimented me
on any of it, as I remember.

535
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:04,244
Before you do more damage to yourself
or your grandchildrens' inheritance...

536
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:06,204
...you'll stop living alone.

537
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,707
I'm not going to that nursing home.

538
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:12,919
Green Grove is a retirement community!
It's like a hotel at Captain Teeb's!

539
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,337
Who's he?

540
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:18,008
A captain who owns luxury hotels
or something.

541
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:22,888
I talked to Mrs. DiCaprio, and she's
got a corner suite available.

542
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,056
It's available. It'll go fast.

543
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,642
Of course it's available.
Somebody died!

544
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:33,231
You gotta stop with this black poison
cloud all the time. I can't take it!

545
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,650
Oh, poor you!

546
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:39,112
I got problems at work,
problems at home.

547
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,823
I got a friend diagnosed with cancer.

548
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:45,702
Most parents would be grateful
if their children did this!

549
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:47,746
I'm not going to that place.

550
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,875
I will go to court and get power
of attorney and place you there.

551
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,293
Then kill me now.

552
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,921
Go on, go into the ham...

553
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:59,549
...and take the carving knife
and stab me here.

554
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,930
Here! Now please, it would hurt me
less than what you just said.

555
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,390
I know seniors that are inspired!

556
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:20,987
Yo, money, we said we'd meet out
front, and you're not even dressed!

557
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:22,948
I'm taking a pass.

558
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:27,452
What? It's Italian suits, Christopher.

559
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:31,957
There was a time when being with
Tony's crew was all I ever dreamed of.

560
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,251
So what am I doing?

561
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,628
This is some fucking note here.

562
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:37,921
Don't wake her up.

563
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:40,298
Come on, it's 5:15.

564
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:45,178
Maybe one reason things are so fucked
in the organization these days...

565
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:49,182
...is guys running off not listening
to middle management.

566
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,269
"Fuck Tony." That's a quote.

567
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,771
We have to stick together.

568
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,190
Why be in a crew?

569
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,733
Why be a gangster?

570
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,402
Hey, coach?

571
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:01,778
Suck my dick.

572
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:02,946
Yeah.

573
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:21,923
Yo! Hey! Yo!
We need some help over here!

574
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:29,389
Okay, let's be very cool, yo!
Get down out of the cab!

575
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,266
You heard the motherfucker.

576
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:34,644
I'm a friend of Billy's.
Your friend on the inside.

577
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:37,856
Yeah, cool. "Increase the peace,"
that's our motto.

578
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:42,110
- I'm gonna take my lunch, okay?
- Yeah, whatever. Come on.

579
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,451
Hold up, man.
You can't drive a Fisher Price.

580
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,916
What's with the gun pointed sideways?

581
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:06,843
Get out! Come on, get down!
You drive, I'll direct you.

582
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,141
Jesus!

583
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,685
Control your shit, fool!

584
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:21,941
Fuck, I'm fucked! Fuck!

585
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:24,903
Fuck!

586
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:30,367
Fuck! Junior-fucking-Soprano's
gonna go ape-shit. Fuck!

587
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,789
You excited about coming
to live with us, hon?

588
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,209
You will be. Trust me.

589
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,587
Look, Ma, here's your stuff.

590
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,715
- Wow, they made good time.
- Yeah.

591
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:50,929
You got your own bed and your dresser.

592
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:54,933
You know, when my grandmother
went to live... elsewhere...

593
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:58,019
...they weren't allowed
personal effects.

594
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,901
All right, Ma, sign right here.

595
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:16,996
Yes?

596
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:20,208
Mr. Soprano, do you have
an Uncle Junior?

597
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,001
He tracked me down here?

598
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,838
Line two? Here you go.

599
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,631
I'll call him back.

600
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:29,717
He'll return the call. He did?

601
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:35,140
It's urgent. She said he sounded
upset. He'll call back.

602
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:43,106
Livia, did you ever hear the old
Italian saying? My aunt used to go:

603
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:46,317
"Col tempo la foglia
di gelso diventa seta."

604
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,575
What's that mean, Bonnie?

605
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:57,745
Time and patience change
the mulberry leaf to silk.

606
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:13,761
You gonna be all right?

607
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,139
Yeah, sure.

608
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,433
Thanks for all your help.

609
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,312
I'll make us a nice lunch.

610
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:25,315
I've got some fantastic
prosciutto in there.

611
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:29,694
Hello?

612
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,113
Yeah. It's Christopher.

613
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:34,532
Yeah.

614
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,494
I've been calling for hours.
Call me on an outside line.

615
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:55,094
T, don't get mad.
There's been a little shit.

616
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,514
- I had nothing to do with it...
- Spit it out!

617
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,099
Brendan hit Comley again.

618
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,060
He what?

619
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:07,815
- And the driver, you know...
- No, I don't know.

620
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:12,403
He caught some friendly fire
or something and he's gone.

621
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,031
Oh, fuck!

622
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,450
What do we do, T?
Brendan didn't fence the load.

623
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:21,037
He's thinking it was Mario
who dimed us to Junior last time.

624
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,622
Fuck!

625
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,475
Hey, Ton.

626
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:45,603
Sorry you have to wreck
your Saturday like this.

627
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:51,442
You boys. You boys, I'll tell you.

628
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,781
It's beautiful stuff, though.

629
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:58,866
- Ton, I'm so sorry.
- Shut up.

630
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:01,869
Just so you realize I had
nothing to do with this.

631
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,622
- Ton, that's true. He stood home.
- Shut up.

632
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:06,874
Stood home?

633
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:12,922
Did you do anything to stop it?
Did you offer any guidance?

634
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,593
What do we mean when we say
leadership, hm?

635
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:20,888
Part of it's the crank. But I'm
going into detox, swear on my mother.

636
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,809
Brendan, shut the fuck up.
You want to get me clipped?

637
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,105
What are we gonna do?

638
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,444
You're gonna put these suits back
in the truck and give them back.

639
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:35,903
Fuck!

640
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,406
Then call my uncle
and tell him it's done.

641
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,492
What about the dead guy?

642
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:45,079
Prod him with a stick.
Light a candle to St. Anthony.

643
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,956
But I think you're fucked.

644
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,294
Ton...

645
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:55,590
...what if this didn't go back?
Would it be a problem?

646
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:02,347
I don't see you assholes putting
that rack, and that rack...

647
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,849
...and this rack here
back in the truck.

648
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:17,737
Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in.

649
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,030
Hmm!

650
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:23,117
Hey, Mr. Miller, your car is back.

651
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:27,163
My wife dropped me off
and there it was, in my parking spot.

652
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,499
My Uncle Pussy
helped my dad locate it.

653
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,125
Uncle Pussy?

654
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,836
He's in the car business.

655
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:38,007
I don't know what to say to your
dad, I mean, thanks of course.

656
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,093
It's nice and clean too.

657
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,387
Whoa, different keys!

658
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:47,600
It's probably too much to hope my
papers are still inside the trunk.

659
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:49,894
It's a different color.

660
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,397
Whoa. Ooh.

661
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:56,567
My dad's a hero.

662
00:45:56,879 --> 00:46:00,381
Did you actually lose
consciousness like with the ducks?

663
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,008
No.

664
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:08,264
Just a shortness of breath and
the white spots in my field of vision.

665
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:10,224
Improvement.

666
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,685
Because I'm sad to put my mother away?

667
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,938
Sad is good. Unconscious isn't.

668
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:21,444
She'll be in very good hands.
You've done the best for her.

669
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:25,281
She won't speak to me.

670
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:30,077
That is sad.
But whose choice is that?

671
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,538
Somehow that doesn't make it
any better.

672
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:37,293
Can you admit to yourself that yes,
you're sad...

673
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,421
...but you're angry and full of rage?

674
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:41,923
I'm sad.

675
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,383
It's hard to admit that...

676
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:48,346
...you may have feelings of hatred
towards your mother, isn't it?

677
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,431
You're out of your tree.

678
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:54,685
Listen carefully.
Of course you love her.

679
00:46:55,729 --> 00:47:00,441
What I'm trying to say is, own
the anger instead of displacing it.

680
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:04,862
Otherwise it defines your life.
It needs to be acknowledged.

681
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:08,658
It's a good thing time is up.
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

682
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,159
"Hate your mother."

683
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,732
Shit.

684
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:45,278
A what do you call it? A menu.

685
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:49,866
Press two if you know
your party's extension.

686
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:52,994
Is that an operator
or an answering machine?

687
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,872
Let's see. Hello? Hello?

688
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:57,874
Hello?

689
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,876
Hello?

690
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,296
Press zero. Hello?

691
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,591
Hello? Hello?

692
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:11,345
Ooh.


1
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:46,898
You should've rang
the doorbell, Brendan.

2
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:50,443
Hey, you! Yeah, you!
What are you doing?

3
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:52,737
We found this truck
on the side of the road.

4
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:56,282
There might be transmission trouble.
You should check it out.

5
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:58,868
What's going on?
Hey, that's the truck.

6
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,079
The one that was stolen in Newark?

7
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,997
What are you doing with the truck?

8
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:07,710
It's a gift from Tony Soprano.

9
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:13,883
Let's call the cops.
Those guys killed Hector.

10
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:17,929
I don't believe it. We just returned
the biggest score of my year.

11
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,681
Listen, you fuck.

12
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,184
Uncle Junior's breaking Tony's
balls since you hijacked that truck.

13
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:26,229
You're lucky Tony doesn't shove
the cab up your ass.

14
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,650
What else did Comley say?

15
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,153
Nothing much.

16
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,864
There was stuff missing
from the truck...

17
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:39,200
...but he didn't give a fuck
as long as the thing's back.

18
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:43,496
Then he said to tell Tony thanks,
and if Tony needs anything, to call.

19
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,165
Tony?

20
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,168
Those junkie fucks work for Tony.

21
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:51,588
They hijack Comley's truck,
I get it, and he thanks Tony?

22
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:57,135
Well, I think you should've taken care
of this Christopher Moltisanti thing...

23
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,637
...the minute it first happened.

24
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:03,391
You should've sent a clear signal:
"You fuck with Junior Soprano..."

25
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:06,978
Take it easy.
We're not making a Western here.

26
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,401
Fucking family.

27
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,988
I bought his kid
a $400 surfboard for his birthday.

28
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,474
Mr. Soprano?

29
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,351
How you doing?

30
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,525
Is that a trick picture out there?

31
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:57,237
Which?

32
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:58,655
The barn.

33
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:02,408
And the old tree
all rotted out inside.

34
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:05,745
It's just a picture I bought.

35
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:08,998
I remember, in a little gallery
in Provincetown.

36
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,418
That is a special-made
psychological picture.

37
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:15,380
Like that what-do-you-call-it test.

38
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,092
The Korschach.

39
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,344
You think I want to trick you?

40
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,846
- Oh, no.
- What does that picture say?

41
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:26,599
"We're from Harvard,
and what do you think of...

42
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:30,019
...this depressing barn
and this rotted-out tree here?"

43
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:32,397
It's depressing and scary to you?

44
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,107
Not to me.

45
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,110
But it's got that built right into it.

46
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:39,821
How are things?

47
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,406
Good.

48
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,117
I had a real good week.

49
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,495
A friend's in the hospital.

50
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,747
That's never pleasant, but...

51
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:52,542
Otherwise, I'm having a good week.

52
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:55,211
- What's he in for?
- They thought it was an ulcer.

53
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:57,297
You know, then this, then that.

54
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,507
- You're worried about him?
- Jackie?

55
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:03,052
Jackie's so fucking mean,
he'll scare that cancer away.

56
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,096
Your friend has cancer?

57
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:12,312
Jackie, when they hook you up,
do you make sure they don't have...

58
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:14,897
...air in your veins,
or is that just bullshit?

59
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:16,232
What do you mean?

60
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:20,862
This is a good hospital, sweetheart.
Nothing like that's gonna happen here.

61
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:24,365
Air in the line'll kill you.
You know who else...?

62
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:25,616
Hey!

63
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,745
You know who else has cancer?

64
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:31,039
Tommy DiPalma.

65
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,417
He's got it much worse.
It's eating his brain away.

66
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,003
Hey, somebody having a baby or what?

67
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,630
- How you doing?
- All right.

68
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:41,507
- How you feeling?
- Good.

69
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,010
Hesh, how you doing?
Good to see you.

70
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,845
Thanks for coming.

71
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:48,056
Jackie, looking well, pal.

72
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,640
Here, Ro, for you.

73
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,559
You're beautiful.

74
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:55,396
Mikey, nice to see you again
in men's clothing.

75
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,648
I should grab a fire extinguisher.

76
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:02,320
I heard your friend had a spontaneous
combustion in his restaurant.

77
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:05,031
I'm going to the cafeteria.
Want anything?

78
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,574
A plate of braciole.

79
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:11,204
- They got grappa in this thing?
- Oh, I wish.

80
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,873
See you later. I got some errands.

81
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,709
- Give Junior my love.
- I will.

82
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:18,586
Hey.

83
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:22,799
Tell my uncle I sent back the truck.
Give me the vinegar peppers he owes me.

84
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:28,721
Thank God he left.

85
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,641
He's a nice guy,
but he's like the Grim Reaper.

86
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:35,520
He knows every guy with cancer,
and he can't wait to tell you.

87
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:39,148
Jackie, you might be a candidate
for clinical trials.

88
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,526
These stem cell therapies...

89
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:45,154
Paulie, he don't want to hear
no more cancer talk.

90
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:47,073
Get the fuck out of here!

91
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:52,120
Trust me, you caught a break being
Jewish. See what I gotta deal with?

92
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,123
Jews, that's right.
I knew there was something.

93
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,083
Tony, you know Teittleman?

94
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:00,711
Owns property. Owns the motel
down the street from the club.

95
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:04,173
The Jew with the black clothes
and the curls.

96
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:05,925
They're called Hasidim.

97
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,802
"Hasidim" but I don't believe them.

98
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:11,931
- What does Teittleman want?
- A divorce for his daughter.

99
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:13,433
What do you mean?

100
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:17,103
His son-in-law will not give
his daughter the consent...

101
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:20,440
...unless Teittleman gives him
50% of his motel.

102
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,525
They call it a get.

103
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,444
Why don't he just?

104
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:27,488
It's taboo for their religion.

105
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:29,073
You know about this shit?

106
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:33,411
Run. Trust me. You don't want
to do business with these people.

107
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,956
He said there's 25 large in it
if we can get him this get.

108
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,499
There's a saying amongst Jews:

109
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,794
"When a Jew gets a divorce,
even the altar sheds tears."

110
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,838
All right, I heard enough.

111
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,757
Look, I'm getting kind of tired.

112
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,802
Let's go get a cup of coffee.

113
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,513
See you later, Jackie.
Take care.

114
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,876
That crash was Meadow Soprano
jumping her cue.

115
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:26,672
Miss Marris, we're exhausted from
studying for SATs. We were up past 2.

116
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:28,925
- Are you her lawyer?
- No.

117
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,552
Why they'd schedule SATs
the same week...

118
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:33,721
- Same day.
- What?

119
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:40,311
If we're kicked out of Concert Singers,
we lose our best extracurricular.

120
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:43,105
Goodbye, Berkeley.
Hello, Glassboro State.

121
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:48,319
I cannot wait until all of North America
is between me and Tony and Carmela.

122
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:49,820
New Jersey blows.

123
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:52,114
I want to go to Berkeley so bad.

124
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,492
The whole East, I can't deal anymore.

125
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:57,078
So we don't sleep till after the SATs.

126
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,997
Don't mind the mess.
I wasn't expecting company.

127
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:02,291
I couldn't wait.
I had to see the new house.

128
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:05,419
- Where's King Arthur?
- Downstairs. This plumbing!

129
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:07,088
- Here?
- Yeah.

130
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,093
Oh, I love the coziness.

131
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,012
Welcome to the neighborhood.

132
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,974
Well, the school district, anyway.

133
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,851
Carm, you did not have to do this.

134
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,772
I mean, we don't see each other
like we used to...

135
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:27,108
I want that to change.

136
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,281
- Could this be Artie Bucco?
- Hey, capitano!

137
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,824
The place looks good.

138
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,577
It needs a little work,
but we'll get there.

139
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:41,581
You need some cash until the
insurance on the restaurant comes...

140
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,335
There'll be an Italian president
before I see any insurance money.

141
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,212
I thought that was settled.

142
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:51,757
Join the club. They're doing
a second arson investigation.

143
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,468
They think you're Mobbed up?
You're a working stiff.

144
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,640
It doesn't make any sense. Who would
burn down a perfectly good restaurant?

145
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:01,934
It's stupid.

146
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,228
Insane.

147
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:10,192
- Sorry, Artie.
- Life goes on, no?

148
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,361
I could always be a plumber, no?

149
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:14,905
Only one concept to master:
Shit runs downhill.

150
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:19,118
Yes, it does. Come in the kitchen.
I'll buy you a beer.

151
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,424
- Mr. Soprano.
- Mr. Teittleman.

152
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,343
- My pleasure.
- Have a seat.

153
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:37,803
- Thank you.
- Silvio you know.

154
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:39,513
Paulie.

155
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:41,015
How are you?

156
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,017
This is my son.

157
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,479
Does he have a name?

158
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,731
Oh, I'm sorry. It's Hillel.

159
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,986
You know about
my daughter and her husband?

160
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,488
Yeah, he knows.

161
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,406
Do you have a daughter, Mr. Soprano?

162
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:00,493
Yes. Call me Tony.

163
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:03,871
What would you do if she was
abused by her husband?

164
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,164
Talk to him.

165
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:07,291
Yeah, in ball-peen hammer.

166
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,168
I think you understand my anger.

167
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:13,506
He's harming my daughter,
and he's mocking our laws of marriage.

168
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:17,259
Look, let's understand each other
from the get-go here, okay?

169
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,136
I'm in waste management.

170
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:23,307
I'm only here because I'm Silvio's
friend, you're Silvio's friend.

171
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:26,268
You may be having a problem
I can help you with.

172
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,813
If I can do it,
that will make me happy.

173
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,022
Ha!

174
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,816
What's your problem, Hil?

175
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:43,744
Please finish.

176
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:46,539
You're being shaken down
for 50% of your motels.

177
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:47,748
Correct.

178
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:52,044
The goon squads who smacked these
husbands around to get the divorce...

179
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:54,088
...were put out of business
by the D.A.

180
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:59,343
All right, 25%.
He wants 50, we get 25.

181
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,053
I don't understand.

182
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:02,680
I'm not talking to you.

183
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:17,111
You get me what I want, Mr. Soprano,
and you have a deal.

184
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,529
It's done.

185
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:23,117
You let them in our motel,
you'll never get them out.

186
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:26,412
That's a commercial, isn't it?

187
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:37,298
Julio, before lunch
I want you to do bedding inventory.

188
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:40,426
Half-hour, and no cervezas, please.

189
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,515
Yes, may I help you?

190
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,976
That depends. Are you Ariel?

191
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:51,979
That also depends.
Are you a bill collector?

192
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:55,149
What is this, the Catskills?
Shecky Greene we got here.

193
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,151
Let's talk about your father-in-law.

194
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,986
I'm sorry. He's not here.

195
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,197
We know he's not here.

196
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:05,701
But we want to talk to you
about him and you. And him.

197
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,953
This problem that you're having.

198
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:10,080
Look, I don't know who you are...

199
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:14,835
...but any problem I may be having
with my family is none of your matter.

200
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,337
So get out of here.

201
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,799
No, no, look.
Shlomo is a friend of mine.

202
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,509
And you're bragging this?

203
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:23,969
This guy...

204
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:27,348
You couldn't possibly understand
what's going on here.

205
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:31,769
Shlomo is an arrogant,
ignorant control freak.

206
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,273
Look, I know him since before I had
hair on my pitzl. I made this place.

207
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:40,277
The flyers, the car rental drop-off,
the business breakfast.

208
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,196
It was me, not him.

209
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,533
So I sweated blood into this place,
and he owes me.

210
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:48,118
And I intend to get what's mine.

211
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:52,164
So, please, don't embarrass yourself
any further. Just leave.

212
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:55,125
I'm not embarrassed. You embarrassed?

213
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,045
Listen to me, you weirdo fuck.

214
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:02,216
You give Shlomo whatever he wants
and you forget this 50% shit.

215
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,553
You got nothing coming to you.
Understand me? Nothing!

216
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:07,012
Fuck you!

217
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:09,807
Bupkes. Say bupkes, Paulie.

218
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,767
That's how they say "nothing."

219
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,354
Fuck that.
This is how I say "nothing."

220
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:18,440
How's that for nothing?

221
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,280
- You know what?
- Probably not.

222
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,365
The fundraiser for Pediatric Hospital?

223
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,910
I'm gonna hire Artie and Charmaine
to cater it.

224
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:35,082
Since when do we
open our house to strangers?

225
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:38,252
Oh, you're right.
Let's just move back to Italy.

226
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:42,548
We'll live in a hill town like
our ancestors, put a wall around it...

227
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:45,759
...and throw burning oil on all
travelers that knock at the gate.

228
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:49,096
Come on!

229
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:56,228
Poor Charmaine. I tried to find
nice things to say about that house.

230
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,815
Ain't that bad. Just needs
a little work, that's all.

231
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:03,360
Those two are so broke.
And that fire.

232
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,488
If that insurance would
get off its ass.

233
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:09,241
- Could it have been arson?
- What's the matter with you?

234
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,747
Hey!

235
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,169
I can't believe you guys
didn't get enough for us.

236
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:22,671
Yeah, put Matt on.

237
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:25,007
Hold on.

238
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:27,927
What's going on?
You trying to damage your inner ears?

239
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:29,386
We're studying.

240
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:32,139
These are practice tests
and they're brutal.

241
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:34,391
Your parents know you're here,
cacciatore?

242
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,727
- They don't care.
- She's sleeping over.

243
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:42,107
Can Hunter please sleep over?

244
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:44,944
Start sleeping, then.
Study time's over.

245
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,237
We still have six more chapters left.

246
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:53,118
Then can you keep the decibel level
down, please? For my husband.

247
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,999
Matt, I'm serious, you guys.

248
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,710
If we can't score some crystal,
we're dead.

249
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,631
With this budget, we can do
three waiters for the hors d'oeuvres...

250
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,341
...two for the champagne.

251
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:11,512
It's such a load off.
This party has me at sixes and sevens.

252
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:14,807
Pediatric Hospital's
such a worthy cause.

253
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,100
Oona!

254
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:23,023
There's fingerprints on the breakfront.
I want this place to sparkle.

255
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:28,487
She's usually very good. From Poland.

256
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,449
Please get in the car, sir.

257
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:37,538
Like the cop would be calling him
"sir" if the cameras weren't around.

258
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,498
I saw this one.

259
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,251
Then call Tony
so he can call Junior...

260
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,670
...and see if we can
change the channel.

261
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,588
Get that, will you, babe?

262
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:49,258
Sure. I'm the only one
who has to go to work.

263
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,052
Yeah, restaurant hostess.
Real tough work.

264
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,013
It's your little cousin.

265
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,890
- What's up?
- How are you?

266
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,226
- What are you doing here?
- Hello to you too.

267
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:01,020
Hunter, what are you doing?

268
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:03,731
Don't mind him. His brain is fried.

269
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,524
You want a soda or something?

270
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,860
- How about a beer?
- Yeah, right.

271
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:11,196
Just kidding. I'll have a Coke
if you have one.

272
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:12,781
What do you want, Meadow?

273
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,825
She wants something from me.

274
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,577
In your dreams, Brendan.

275
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,204
So, what do you want?

276
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,417
I wanna cop.

277
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,171
Here you go.

278
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,715
What do you mean, "cop"?

279
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:32,259
Score. We want to score some crystal.

280
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:33,552
You got money?

281
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:36,013
- You ain't giving them shit.
- Why not?

282
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,932
Your father'll put a bullet
in my head.

283
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,894
Since when do you take speed, anyway?

284
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,104
She doesn't. I need it to study.

285
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:47,399
Yeah, right. Hunter needs it.

286
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,069
Forget about it. No fucking way.

287
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:53,989
What?

288
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,908
He just craves attention.

289
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:01,622
Just thought I'd ask you
before we went to Jefferson Avenue.

290
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:05,584
Those melanzane will rob you,
rape you and leave you on the road.

291
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,088
What do you see in him?

292
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,924
Money. What do you think?

293
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:13,383
Fuck you.

294
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:15,886
- See you, Christopher.
- I got my own money.

295
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,931
What about me?
Nobody's gonna say goodbye to me?

296
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:22,893
Bye.

297
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,646
- Bye.
- Bye, guys.

298
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,986
You can't let her go to Jefferson
Avenue. They'll sell her Ajax.

299
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:36,657
She won't go there. She just wants
me to give her some speed.

300
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:40,494
Isn't it better if she gets it from you
with all that poison around?

301
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:45,249
Kids. You think you can protect them.

302
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:47,459
But you can't.

303
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:52,089
With the rainy season,
chicks alter their eating habits.

304
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,675
Are you watching
that nature shit again?

305
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:56,218
What are you doing here?

306
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,929
My kid stepped on a nail.
I had to get him a shot.

307
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:00,639
Yeah, where is he?

308
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,224
At the ER with Carmela.

309
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,394
So whatever happened
with the Jew at the motel?

310
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,230
They reached out to him,
he wasn't receptive.

311
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,149
They're going back.

312
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:17,406
- Want me to leave?
- Just looking for my nurse's pen.

313
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,868
You got the wrong room
because you are not my nurse.

314
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,911
I know, but I made up the bed.

315
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:26,456
No, sweetheart. I have not been
out of this bed all day.

316
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:31,170
- Sorry, I need to check some vitals...
- What are you doing?

317
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:33,130
That seems to be working fine.

318
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:36,300
Nobody sends flower arrangements
like New York.

319
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:38,302
Let me just check his...

320
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,220
Oh!

321
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:44,016
This damn IV.

322
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:45,976
Damn!

323
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:47,728
I got it.

324
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:57,112
I seem to be having a problem. Do you
mind if I borrow one of your gowns?

325
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,324
It's okay.
It's a private party.

326
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:05,621
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Have a nice night.

327
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,080
Oh, Madonna!

328
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:20,219
I got you, you prick!
You should've seen your face!

329
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:23,180
- You prick!
- "I haven't been out of bed."

330
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,098
Look at your face.

331
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:26,558
Who the hell is this?

332
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:32,147
Relax, Mr. Aprile.
It's time for your sponge bath.

333
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:40,489
She's a friend of mine
from the club. Nice girl.

334
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,868
I joined them later on.
We got a little booze.

335
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:50,666
You were nice to have a party
for your friend.

336
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:52,376
Yeah.

337
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:00,259
"Tufts Medical School."

338
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:06,556
You're a doctor.

339
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,977
What do you think? About Jackie?

340
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,021
I'd have to know more about
his condition.

341
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:15,774
I told you about his condition.
He's got cancer.

342
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:17,401
What kind of cancer?

343
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:19,069
It's in the intestines.

344
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:23,198
There was a tumor
and they took it out.

345
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,784
And it's recurred.

346
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:29,037
But you said he might go home.
They're not operating?

347
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:32,374
It's next to something vital.

348
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,835
- I see.
- You see?

349
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,087
From what you're saying,
it doesn't sound good.

350
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:38,880
From what I'm saying?

351
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,174
What do I know? I'm not a doctor.

352
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:43,510
- You're angry. Who with?
- I'll tell you.

353
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:47,556
This man has had chemo every day
for three weeks.

354
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,183
He still has every last hair
on his head.

355
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:54,146
Every last hair on his head,
and he's got a beautiful head of hair.

356
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:57,149
So don't tell me how it sounds.
You don't know him or me...

357
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,026
...or what you're talking about.

358
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:02,487
We're getting closer to you
confronting your true feelings...

359
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:04,656
...about what's really going on.

360
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:07,492
Wait a minute.
I just told you my true feelings.

361
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:09,661
You tell me what's really going on.

362
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:12,664
The tree in the painting rotted out,
you said.

363
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:14,750
Nothing indicates that.

364
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:17,294
I knew that was a fucking scam.

365
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:20,297
I knew that painting was
a fucking scam!

366
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:23,675
You remember your dream? The ducks?

367
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:26,219
It took on another meaning.

368
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,723
What happens to a tree
that's rotted out?

369
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:32,184
Trees, ducks.
What are you? Ranger Rick?

370
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:35,604
Some job you shrinks got.
You think everybody's lying...

371
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:39,566
...while you're pulling scams on them!
Fuck you!

372
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:46,698
There's 37 definites.
We got another 13 maybes...

373
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:49,576
...plus the whole
Pediatric Hospital Board.

374
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:51,453
Right.

375
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:54,164
Are you sure we ordered
enough champagne?

376
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,458
Right.

377
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:59,836
Gene says they shouldn't be too sober
for the auction.

378
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:03,340
If anyone ever finds out
you got this from me...

379
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:06,468
Look at me. This is no joke.

380
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:10,013
We don't always get along,
but you don't want to see me dead.

381
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:12,140
I gotta call Hunter.
You're the best.

382
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:16,520
Hey, I'm serious. Just this once,
okay? I'm no drug dealer.

383
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:20,357
I don't want to see you get poisoned.
Your father ever finds out...

384
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:22,734
God, doesn't anyone ever knock?

385
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:26,530
Tell Brendan that Hunter would
rather die than go out with him.

386
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:28,156
Brendan?

387
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:31,410
Christopher, keep that asshole
away from that child.

388
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:33,995
He asked me to do him a favor,
I did it.

389
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:37,749
All right, you delivered the message.
Now let Meadow study.

390
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:45,048
Two goombahs
from the old neighborhood.

391
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:49,761
What, they think they're gonna name it
the Soprano Wing in the new hospital?

392
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:52,472
I think you're just
jealous of their money.

393
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,141
- Me?
- Yeah.

394
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,143
Okay, but explain to me this.

395
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:59,479
He offers us two tickets to the
Caribbean out of friendship.

396
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,356
You say no, they're tainted.

397
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:04,734
But for some party,
I take his money to clean his toilets.

398
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:09,072
First of all, Arthur, this is
a paying job and not some cruise.

399
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:11,741
And why do you always
have to exaggerate?

400
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,952
You're not cleaning his toilets.
You're a chef.

401
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:18,707
Good. So you don't mind that he
fronts me money for a new place...

402
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,542
...because he offered.

403
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:23,670
Look at that face.

404
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,716
Oh, God, don't tell me that you
took money from Tony Soprano.

405
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:32,095
How is it different?
I'm a chef. I need a place to cook.

406
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:35,307
How? I'm giving Carmela my support,
that's how.

407
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:37,767
And it's for a very reputable cause.

408
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:42,189
But to have that man as a partner,
trust me, that would be insane.

409
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,316
It'd mean the end of everything.

410
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:46,067
At least he made the gesture.

411
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,113
Name me another person who offered us
anything except the Sopranos?

412
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:53,658
Watch what you're doing.
You're squeezing the quail.

413
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,834
Should we turn on the air?

414
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:05,253
It's going okay.
Do you like the food?

415
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:08,381
I was so busy schmoozing,
I barely had a bite.

416
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:11,176
Don't miss those
little veal tonnatos.

417
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:12,844
Charmaine!

418
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:14,221
Sure. Wow.

419
00:25:14,472 --> 00:25:15,555
Charmaine!

420
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:26,024
Not in the car! Please!
Not in the car!

421
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:27,901
Shut up! Shut up!

422
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:30,320
Shut up and get in
the fucking car!

423
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,324
Get in there, you miserable
fucking prick!

424
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,167
I can't get used to
strangers in my house.

425
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:45,502
Why'd you invite them?

426
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,007
Try one of these.

427
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:56,721
You're a fucking great cook.

428
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:59,349
I cook like this...

429
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,561
...it reminds me of what I lost.

430
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,899
To have my restaurant ripped from me.
I can't tell you...

431
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,776
It was like losing a limb.

432
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:15,198
- Sometimes I lay in bed...
- Statti zitto! Enough already.

433
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:17,909
Forget about the past.
Look to the future.

434
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,289
I'm sick of hearing of your restaurant.
Shut up, you depressing jerk!

435
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,583
What the fuck do you know about it?

436
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:28,587
You motherfucker.

437
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:38,597
You fucking jerk!

438
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:41,266
Come on. Give it up.

439
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:48,023
See what you get when you...

440
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:51,985
Fucking son of a bitch!

441
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:56,281
- Get up, you stubborn fuck.
- Please!

442
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:00,076
Too late. All this because
you won't say yes to a divorce?

443
00:27:00,328 --> 00:27:01,453
It's not that simple!

444
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:05,582
Why not? You sign your fucking name
to a piece of paper!

445
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,250
I don't like you.

446
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:10,337
Well, I don't like you.
You believe this prick?

447
00:27:10,755 --> 00:27:14,549
What do I get, huh? You work
for nothing? I don't think so!

448
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:16,968
I say we force-feed him his sombrero.

449
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:20,263
She wants to go to Israel,
I send her. I pay.

450
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:23,433
I feed her, I clothe her,
I put a roof over her head.

451
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:26,770
I worked for her father for 20 years
and took his abuse.

452
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:28,313
So I get nothing?

453
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:30,315
- Stand up!
- We don't care.

454
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,692
Tough fucking luck, ain't it, pal?

455
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:35,654
You mother...!

456
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:37,947
Silvio!

457
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:45,288
Motherfucker.

458
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,374
This guy's a bull.

459
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:51,628
Paulie, if we don't kill this prick...

460
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:53,880
...we should put him to work.

461
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:01,221
Time's a-wasting.

462
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:04,683
I was lucky I could get out at all
with that party tonight.

463
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:10,563
Shit!

464
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:20,031
- Hello.
- Tony.

465
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:23,785
Sorry to bother you.
This isn't working out how we hoped.

466
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:26,579
With our friend
with the funny sideburns.

467
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:28,873
Don't say no more on the phone.

468
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,793
I'm coming down.

469
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:34,087
Shit!

470
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:36,589
I gotta go.

471
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:40,093
You just got here.

472
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:42,637
Yeah, I know, but I gotta go.

473
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:57,652
What's that painting mean to you?

474
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:03,074
Nothing. It just reminds me
of David Hockey.

475
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,137
You want something to munch on?

476
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:26,931
Are you kidding me?

477
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:30,518
Most guys I know would be happy
to get rid of their wife.

478
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:33,146
I tried explaining the realities here.

479
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:36,065
This guy's as stubborn
as a fucking mule.

480
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:38,109
He says it's principle.

481
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:42,322
I think we gotta... you know.
That's why we called you.

482
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,616
I promised the father-in-law
I wouldn't.

483
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,451
I don't know what else to do.

484
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:53,875
You're a stupid fucker,
you know that?

485
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:55,877
I've heard it said.

486
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:57,837
What are you, proud of it?

487
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:02,967
You kill me and a dark cloud goes over
Shlomo's house.

488
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:07,096
Either way, they'll be no get
unless restitution is made.

489
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:11,059
You really would let me kill you,
you sick fuck.

490
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:15,355
You ever heard of the Masada?

491
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:20,610
For two years, 900 Jews
held their own...

492
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,863
...against 15,000 Roman soldiers.

493
00:30:25,074 --> 00:30:27,992
They chose death before enslavement.

494
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:31,663
And the Romans, where are they now?

495
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:35,124
You're looking at them, asshole.

496
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:43,383
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

497
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:46,344
...I fear no evil
for Thou art with me.

498
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,388
Yeah, hold that thought.

499
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:01,401
Yeah?

500
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:05,613
I'm with my non-shellfish-eating
friend, and I'm tapped out.

501
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:07,782
This guy won't listen to reason.

502
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:10,952
Didn't I tell you, huh?

503
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,246
I warned you to keep away
from them.

504
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:14,914
He left me no options.

505
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:17,584
He's willing to go down with the ship.

506
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,129
Here's a thought.

507
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:23,840
Maybe he's willing to go to
the world to come...

508
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:26,050
...but if he's stuck here
on this earth...

509
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:30,054
...I know one thing that no man
wants to go through life without.

510
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:31,556
What?

511
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:33,683
Oh.

512
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:36,728
That's a brilliant idea.

513
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,480
Make like a mohel, huh?

514
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:41,107
Finish his bris.

515
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:42,525
Yeah.

516
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:48,031
Paulie, get the ball cutters
from out of the truck.

517
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:51,159
Ariel, we're going to plan B.

518
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,912
The phone has been ringing
all morning.

519
00:31:54,163 --> 00:31:57,123
The Rotellis, the Trillos.
He has to do with computers.

520
00:31:57,374 --> 00:32:00,126
They're wonderful.
She invited us to brunch.

521
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:02,462
- Really?
- Yep.

522
00:32:03,297 --> 00:32:06,549
But it was the food, Mainie.
Everybody raved about it.

523
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:11,721
Cynthia said, "I love those rice balls,"
like she never had arancini before.

524
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:16,100
Really, Mainie, I couldn't have
done it without you.

525
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,603
It meant so much to me,
having you here.

526
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:21,189
It just made it so much fun for me.

527
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:25,151
Mainie, is something wrong?
You got something on your mind?

528
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:26,736
What could be wrong?

529
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,739
Listen, sweetie.

530
00:32:30,366 --> 00:32:34,661
It may not seem like it right now,
but you'll get back on your feet again.

531
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:37,872
Carmela, I'm fine where I am.

532
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,125
I know. That's not what I meant.

533
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:44,462
Carmela, I never wanted
to tell you this.

534
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:49,092
It happened so long ago.
You and Tony weren't even married.

535
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:52,679
It's probably silly for me
to even bring it up now.

536
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,180
What?

537
00:32:56,684 --> 00:32:58,726
You were at the shore
with your parents.

538
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:01,479
You and Tony were on the outs.
He called me.

539
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:02,772
He did?

540
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:06,651
One thing led to another,
we started dating each other and...

541
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,028
Carmela, I slept with him.

542
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,699
You slept with Tony?

543
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:16,202
Really, it wasn't for me.

544
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:20,873
Carmela, what I'm trying to say is,
stop worrying about me.

545
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:25,837
Really. I mean, we both made
our choices. I'm fine with mine.

546
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:46,858
I'd like for you to consider this.

547
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:48,151
Don't give me that.

548
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:50,445
What's going on? Why'd you page me?

549
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:53,239
This guy's trying to pull
some bullshit.

550
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:56,242
Hey, ZZ Top. The guy gave you
the get, didn't he?

551
00:33:56,493 --> 00:34:00,413
But not because of you.
You threatened him with castration.

552
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:05,626
It was business that brought him around.
He wanted 50%, you wanted 25%.

553
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:08,379
So I split the difference.
I gave him 15%...

554
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,257
...he gives my daughter
the divorce...

555
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:15,053
- It's business. It worked out.
- You gotta walk with me, Shlomo.

556
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:17,096
Listen, don't worry.

557
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:20,433
I'm taking good care of you here.

558
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:21,726
What's that?

559
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:25,480
For your considerable trouble.
As the Talmud says...

560
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:29,025
I don't give a shit
what he says, okay?

561
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:32,528
You want to give your son-in-law
15% of the motel?

562
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,239
You go ahead.
It comes out of your end.

563
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:39,744
Now, we got you your get.
You get us our 25%. Got it?

564
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:41,537
My son was right.

565
00:34:41,789 --> 00:34:44,832
You're mud. Godless clay!

566
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:48,836
I created a living golem!

567
00:34:49,088 --> 00:34:50,505
What the fuck is a golem?

568
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:52,799
It's a monster! Frankenstein!

569
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,634
- Get out of here...
- Living dead!

570
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:58,179
...before I take your asshole son
and shove him up your ass!

571
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,847
Shut up!

572
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:12,568
Hey.

573
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:15,905
Hey, how you doing?

574
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:18,199
One second.

575
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:25,498
I got some good news. We're in the
motel business. How do you like that?

576
00:35:32,256 --> 00:35:33,464
Read this.

577
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,262
102.7.

578
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:43,933
They should take my temperature
with the other machine.

579
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:46,519
Paulie broke his hand
on the guy's head.

580
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:48,771
- Digital.
- We're waling on this guy.

581
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:51,774
- I'm gonna cut his dick off.
- I'll call the nurse.

582
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:55,069
He's mumbling and praying.
I'm getting his pants off.

583
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:57,321
They should take my temperature again.

584
00:35:58,031 --> 00:35:59,824
Yeah, yeah, call them.

585
00:36:19,303 --> 00:36:20,761
Poor Jackie.

586
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:25,308
God has his reasons.

587
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:28,311
Livia, he looked twice as old as me.

588
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,314
So, what's really on your mind,
Corrado?

589
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:34,192
This Christopher Moltisanti.

590
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:36,986
Christopher? What about him?

591
00:36:37,613 --> 00:36:39,989
Him and his little friend.

592
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,076
They're slapping me in the face,
and they're hiding behind Tony.

593
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:48,164
Well, Tony always loved Christopher
like a son.

594
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:50,750
And so do I, Junior.

595
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:54,045
He put up my storm windows for me
one year.

596
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:57,673
Good.

597
00:37:04,348 --> 00:37:05,806
But what do I do?

598
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:09,560
I just let him and this Filone kid
piss on me in public?

599
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:13,231
And how far do I go before I light
a frigging match...

600
00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:16,025
...under that hotheaded son of yours?

601
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:21,489
Maybe Christopher could use
a little talking to.

602
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:23,115
You know.

603
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,618
The other one...

604
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,120
...Filone?

605
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:34,877
I don't know.

606
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:43,469
You got a lot of sense for an old gal.

607
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:47,265
No, I'm a babbling idiot.

608
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:51,644
That's why my son put me
in a nursing home.

609
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:55,856
He didn't even care I was there.

610
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:00,236
It was just him
and that fucking cancer.

611
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,284
It's like he's already gone.

612
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:08,577
Yes.

613
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:12,957
Ah.

614
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:20,047
Somebody called me
a Frankenstein today.

615
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,382
Really?

616
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:24,927
This Hasid I'm doing business with.

617
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:28,681
These Hasids, I mean,
they're out there...

618
00:38:29,308 --> 00:38:31,684
...but they got their beliefs,
you know?

619
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:36,522
They're not afraid of death.
This one guy wasn't.

620
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:40,109
Maybe they have the belief
because they are afraid.

621
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:41,944
I'm not afraid of death.

622
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:46,615
Not if it's for something.

623
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:49,869
You know? A war, something like that.

624
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:52,371
A reason.

625
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:53,998
But Jackie...

626
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:57,376
To see this strong...

627
00:38:58,462 --> 00:38:59,879
...beautiful man...

628
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:04,258
...just wither away to nothing...

629
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:10,514
And you can't do nothing about it.

630
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:14,894
You can't fight it.

631
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:18,606
You envy the Hasids and their beliefs?

632
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:20,733
All this shit's for nothing?

633
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:27,239
If it's for nothing,
why must I think about it?

634
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:29,700
That's the mystery, isn't it?

635
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:35,331
The mystery of God,
or whatever you want to call it...

636
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:38,876
...and why we're given
the questionable gift...

637
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:41,504
...of knowing that we're gonna die.

638
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:52,181
Do you feel like Frankenstein?

639
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:57,228
A thing?

640
00:39:58,105 --> 00:40:00,147
Lacking humanity?

641
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:03,109
Lacking human feelings?

642
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,769
Thank you. That's for you.

643
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,230
Say hello to Freddy, all right?

644
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:53,826
Let go!

645
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:10,176
Let me go!

646
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:11,677
Let me go!

647
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:16,182
You're friends of
Tony's goomar, right?

648
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:18,601
Meadow wanted the crystal.

649
00:41:18,852 --> 00:41:22,229
If I didn't get it to her,
she would've went to Jefferson.

650
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:25,441
You tell Tony.
They would've beat her and raped her!

651
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:27,276
I don't want to die now!

652
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:30,613
I didn't mean it. I am sorry!

653
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:34,033
Listen to me!
I was trying to save her!

654
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,285
Listen to me! You speak English?

655
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:38,537
Don't shoot me! Don't shoot!

656
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:57,765
Fuck!

657
00:42:58,034 --> 00:42:59,952
Hi, Jack. Bye, Jack.


1
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,703
You gonna say something, or what?

2
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:03,206
It's your dime.

3
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:09,212
What's he doing here?

4
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:12,882
A friend of mine walked by.

5
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:15,718
Heshie. He has a 3:00.

6
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,867
Yeah, baby.

7
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:59,762
- What the hell's going on?
- Thunderstorms.

8
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,684
- Jackie.
- You smell it?

9
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,936
That's rain.

10
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:11,566
Dr. Melfi, what the hell
are you doing to me?

11
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:23,036
Go back to sleep.

12
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:45,391
What are you doing up?
You got school tomorrow.

13
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:47,518
Working on a high score.

14
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,313
- Did your mother go to bed?
- Yeah.

15
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:51,814
Where were you?

16
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:55,276
The compactor went down
at Barone Sanitation.

17
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,490
Move over.

18
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:05,787
- Ready?
- Yeah.

19
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,163
Go!

20
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:10,083
Watch out for the ghosts.

21
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:14,796
This ain't steering right.

22
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,673
Yeah, kicking your butt.

23
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,592
So how're things going with you?

24
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,012
How's school?

25
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:33,439
Dad, you have to concentrate.
New game.

26
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,447
- No fair.
- It's called a handicap.

27
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:43,908
Come on, stop!

28
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,201
I'm kicking your ass!

29
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:47,620
- One hand, look at that!
- I can't see.

30
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,709
Get off!

31
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,044
Ow! Stop! Come on!

32
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,508
You lose.

33
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:04,554
Focus through distractions.
There's your lesson.

34
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,723
I want you in bed in 10 minutes.

35
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,727
Andretti, you listening to me?

36
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,272
Good night, Dad.

37
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:15,690
Good night.

38
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:20,903
Where'd you park?

39
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,406
In the parking lot.

40
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:27,410
- No one followed me.
- Adriana, you wouldn't know it.

41
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,413
Oh, yeah. Like Tony Soprano's
hiding in my back seat.

42
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:33,916
- You are so paranoid.
- Bring the car right here.

43
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:38,254
I know, he's in disguise.
That could be him.

44
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:42,091
Hey, Tony! Or maybe he's
in the trash can.

45
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,677
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

46
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,638
Ow! Let go of me!

47
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:52,101
It could be anybody, anytime.
I don't even know if it's Tony.

48
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:54,437
You gave crystal meth
to his daughter!

49
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,439
Which I'm not sure he knows.

50
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,524
Look at my wrist. It's all red.

51
00:05:58,776 --> 00:05:59,776
I'm sorry!

52
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:03,613
But I got dragged out to
the fucking Meadowlands by my neck!

53
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:05,907
Mock execution!

54
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
What?

55
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,953
- What?
- Nothing.

56
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,706
- No, what?
- You don't want to know, trust me.

57
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,541
Know what?

58
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:19,379
I heard the nurse say you made
number two in your pants.

59
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,546
Is that what happens?

60
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:24,217
Get the car! Please, can we
just go to Brendan's...

61
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:27,595
...score some shit and find out
what's going on?

62
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:28,971
Please!

63
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,979
Brendan, let's go. Wake up, man.

64
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,318
The fool leaves his door open.

65
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,320
- I gotta pee.
- Go for it.

66
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,448
You should have seen me at the
hospital. Three nurses...

67
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,496
You will comply with the orders.

68
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,353
Yeah. Yeah.

69
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,356
That's the message. Thanks.

70
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:22,692
Way to go, Anth!

71
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:26,946
Hear it in five, four, three, two...

72
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,408
Yo, check it.

73
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:43,880
You think this is funny?

74
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,715
What? What's funny?

75
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,008
I didn't do nothing.

76
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,385
You beep me again, you'll be sorry.

77
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,846
We don't know what
you're talking about.

78
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:55,516
"Your mother blows."
That's a real original message.

79
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,810
- Maybe she does, right?
- Yeah.

80
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:01,189
Then why'd you eat all the
doughnuts she sent us at camp?

81
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,401
And then cry on her shoulder:
"I'm so homesick, Mrs. Piocosta."

82
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,153
Why don't you shut up?

83
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:10,239
Have another doughnut,
you fat fart-knocker!

84
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,370
I'm gonna kill him!

85
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,667
Dickwad!

86
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
Hey, break it up!

87
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,297
Break it up!

88
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,259
I want a 5-minute
cool-down period, now.

89
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:39,185
See you next week, doc.

90
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:40,937
Mr. Dante, you forgot something.

91
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,730
Thank you, baby.

92
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:46,108
- Don't forget to floss.
- You saved my life.

93
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,611
All right. See you next week,
all right?

94
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,450
Can I help you, sir?

95
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:56,577
Sir?

96
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,412
Sir?

97
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,104
Oh, my God.

98
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,441
- I'm having second thoughts.
- About?

99
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,319
This whole thing,
this whole arrangement.

100
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,031
Security.

101
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:37,994
I come here, I tell you things,
I don't know how safe it is.

102
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,454
I understand your concerns.

103
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:42,707
But I told you what
the ground rules are:

104
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,001
As long as I don't hear anything
incriminating...

105
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:48,504
You don't fucking get it.
Just my being here incriminates me!

106
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:52,675
Somebody sees me, they tell somebody
else, all of a sudden I'm a celebrity!

107
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:56,012
I thought we made some progress
on your narcissism.

108
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:58,889
Who are you?

109
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:03,519
Why is that so important
for you to know?

110
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:07,857
My mother told me never to
answer a question with a question.

111
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,069
So your mother did
teach you something.

112
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:16,490
If I asked you about your life,
who you talk to, who you trust?

113
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,368
I'd have to take the Fifth.

114
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,080
That's cute.

115
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:25,875
Oh!

116
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:31,505
I'm sorry, I wasn't aware of
what I was saying.

117
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:34,133
I'm sorry.

118
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,227
- Why are you here?
- Chris sent me for you.

119
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,314
Chris? Did something happen?
Must be my dad, right?

120
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,232
Why else would Chris send you?

121
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,526
Did Brendan get my poem?

122
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:57,114
Another search warrant? Calls them the
Federal Bureau of Annoying Bullshit.

123
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:58,658
You told your old man!

124
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:01,202
You scared me!
What happened to you?

125
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:05,373
We're moving to Florida because you
couldn't keep your mouth shut!

126
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:06,666
What are you talking about?

127
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:08,501
Did Brendan ask about me?

128
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,920
Get us out of here! Get us out!

129
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:15,966
- Did you tell your old man?
- About the meth? Are you insane?

130
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,094
Don't you get it? This is serious!

131
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:20,388
Let go of me!

132
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:22,723
Stop this shit!

133
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:26,227
He's worried about you. He's been
asking about you, asshole.

134
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,022
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

135
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,817
I hate my life, being a Soprano.

136
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:33,984
Hey...

137
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:37,321
...don't ever say you hate life.
That's blasphemy.

138
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:39,073
Fuck you!

139
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:41,075
Okay, let's go.

140
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,119
Remember when you were little?

141
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,705
I'll buy you one of those
Happy Meals, all right?

142
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,832
Where the fuck are you?

143
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,308
This is a new shirt your grandmother
bought. It's in the trash?

144
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:09,311
It's a Westport.
It's not even cool anymore.

145
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,313
What did you just say?

146
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,482
I got in a fight.

147
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:17,361
Hope you did as much damage
to his wardrobe. Who with?

148
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:20,656
I didn't get caught. No demerits.

149
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,324
Anthony, who?

150
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,660
Jeremy.

151
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:26,704
Jeremy Piocosta?

152
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:29,832
You were together at camp.
I thought you were friends.

153
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,837
If that's all the information I get,
I'll call Mrs. Piocosta.

154
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,672
No, Ma, wait! Don't call!

155
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:39,675
You kids are gonna learn
the value of a dollar!

156
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:42,636
- I'll wash your car.
- You never put any effort in.

157
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:45,139
I will, I promise.
I'll do it really good.

158
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,641
Just don't call, I'll get the money.

159
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,518
Forty dollars, Anthony.

160
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,729
I know, I know.

161
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:00,946
Ma!

162
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:02,782
How you doing?

163
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,658
What brings you here?

164
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,787
Remember that pastry place?
Ferrara's?

165
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:10,247
Brought you some macaroons.

166
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,627
They're too sweet!

167
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:17,588
What do you mean?
They're your favorites!

168
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:25,262
The activities director,
Rosie, says...

169
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:28,516
...they're organizing a trip
to the city.

170
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,476
Dinner and a show.

171
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,646
And you don't want to go.

172
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,691
- I don't like the people here.
- You don't know them.

173
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,486
And that city.

174
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,696
Grown men soiling themselves.

175
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,866
- It's not like that anymore.
- That Giuliani...

176
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:47,910
Let's stick to the field trip.

177
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:51,872
Mothers throwing their babies out of
skyscraper windows.

178
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:55,000
You're always with the babies
out the windows.

179
00:13:57,212 --> 00:14:02,258
You don't mix with the other ladies
or talk to the nice gents I see around.

180
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:05,928
- You're not taking opportunities.
- What do you care?

181
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,764
Out of sight, out of mind.

182
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:10,975
We don't think like that.

183
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,435
Not me, or Carm, or the kids.

184
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:16,438
I wish the Lord would take me now.

185
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:23,362
I came to get cheered up.
Think that's a mistake?

186
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,240
You being sarcastic?

187
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,617
You can't put your problems on me.

188
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,829
This is the most expensive
retirement home in New Jersey.

189
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,206
If you wanted to, you
could be happy here.

190
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:35,916
You're pissing it all away.

191
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,836
What beautiful language
for your mother.

192
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:49,972
You want the macaroons?

193
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,099
I don't care.

194
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,569
Leave some out for the lunatics.

195
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,377
Goodbye, Ma.

196
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:28,093
They're saying it might rain today.

197
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:41,649
What the hell are you doing?

198
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,360
This place is an hour from my office.

199
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:48,447
Are you a woman? Get a bladder
transplant. My mother lives here.

200
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,407
It's not real convenient for me.

201
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:54,411
It's not convenient?
Why don't we meet at your precinct?

202
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:58,332
The government would love a few
pictures of us for the scrapbook.

203
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,167
What do you got for me?

204
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,338
Here.

205
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:09,176
- "Jennifer Melfi, M.D."?
- Her background, daily routine.

206
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:11,679
And your personal relationship
with her is?

207
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,347
None of your fucking business.

208
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,975
You can't blame a guy for trying.

209
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:17,726
Are you bored with your life?

210
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:21,063
Oh, yeah, sure!
Busting whores and junkies.

211
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:25,067
Plus, it's a thrill to pay two
alimonies on a $40,000-a-year income.

212
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:26,443
All right, listen.

213
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:28,612
I don't want her touched or bothered.

214
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,407
I want to know the who,
when, why. That's it.

215
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,242
Usual fee?

216
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:36,578
The Knicks lost, lieutenant.

217
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:38,872
You're down two large.

218
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:42,626
- Lay off the vig.
- We'll see what kind of job you do.

219
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:45,713
Okay. See you in a few days.
What you got in the box?

220
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:47,631
Macaroons.

221
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,599
This is awful.

222
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:00,019
I can't deal with this.

223
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:04,606
What kind of God?

224
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,986
Christopher!

225
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:10,362
Where you been?

226
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,450
- What happened to you?
- Brendan's dead.

227
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:15,868
What are you talking about?

228
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,037
The fish is in my pocket.

229
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,456
Brendan's brains are floating
in his bathtub.

230
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:22,416
Message job. Through the eye.

231
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:23,667
Moe Greene special.

232
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,837
- Uncle Junior.
- What do you mean, Moe Greene?

233
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,005
In one.

234
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:32,134
Moe's eyes got too big for his stomach,
so they put a caliber in his eye.

235
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:33,969
Mikey Palmice does their hits.

236
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,473
- In his glasses, you mean.
- Glasses, eyes. Why quibble?

237
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:40,225
I'm at the World Trade Center.

238
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,566
What are you doing?
Palmice's a made guy.

239
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:49,902
He didn't have the balls
to do it himself.

240
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:52,821
Contracted these Russians,
and he killed my friend.

241
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:56,784
Our response should suit the message.

242
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,162
In the mouth means he was a rat.

243
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:04,166
It's just how Francis framed
the shot, for the shock value.

244
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:06,835
Brendan didn't deserve it.
Don't talk me out of it.

245
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:08,837
Listen, you can't touch Mikey.

246
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:12,758
Your uncle's pissing on your head,
what do you expect me to do?

247
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:17,554
I'm on it, T. I know where Mikey's
house is, over by Route 10.

248
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:22,351
No. He tries to leave,
you break his other neck.

249
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:58,220
Hey, Mr. GQ. Got a ticket.

250
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:01,181
- How you doing, Mikey?
- How you doing?

251
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:08,564
Son of a...

252
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:12,568
Your suit's wrinkled. Here, let
me fix it up for you.

253
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:15,445
Why are you screaming?
Free alterations.

254
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,031
Missed a spot.

255
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:23,120
This is overdue.

256
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,257
Hear about the Chinese godfather?

257
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,218
He made them an offer
they couldn't understand.

258
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:41,263
We gonna stop before
it gets out of hand?

259
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:44,600
- Not even a hello?
- I'm here because I love you.

260
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,143
And I respect you.

261
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:48,562
Don't pretend you're
paying me respect.

262
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,898
A son who throws his mother
in an asylum.

263
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:52,858
She lives like a poveretta.

264
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,154
That's none of your business.

265
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:01,074
Your friends get in my business,
expect me to turn the cheek.

266
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:03,160
The truck was made good to you.

267
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:08,040
I'm sitting here like patience
on a monument, waiting for discipline.

268
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,792
Your boys were warned,
and still they embarrass me.

269
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:14,463
I run my crew my way.
What you did was extreme.

270
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,298
Now you're my judge?

271
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,134
I answer to bigger people
than you, my friend.

272
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:21,303
Like Jackie?

273
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,513
Want to take this to his deathbed?

274
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:29,645
That nephew of yours we gave
a high colonic...

275
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:31,521
...he earns good?

276
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,108
- He's coming up.
- Okay.

277
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:37,110
He works for me now.

278
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,447
Excuse me?

279
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:43,325
Maybe he gives you agita for a change.

280
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:48,664
You got some set of balls, you know that?
Absolutely not.

281
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:52,918
I show you my hand,
and you slap it away.

282
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,090
What's the matter with you?

283
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:01,551
Why can't we talk
like adults anymore, huh?

284
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,428
Out.

285
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:06,765
Next time you come in,
you come heavy or not at all.

286
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,979
You don't mean that.

287
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:39,881
By the time I get to take the sergeant
exam, the pay scale is frozen by law.

288
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,050
Why are we following these people?

289
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:45,595
They grabbed a meal, saw a movie.
So what?

290
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,931
Luckily they stopped at
that package store.

291
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:49,683
I got a juice.

292
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:52,519
Yeah, I can smell the potatoes.

293
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:54,313
Hey, listen, asshole.

294
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:58,608
Same make and model left the scene
of a homicide on Long Island.

295
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,152
Stay fucking current.

296
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:07,576
You broke it off
with the shlub after a week?

297
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,454
I know. I feel for you males.

298
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:14,249
It's our goddamned fault
you don't know how to act.

299
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:15,959
Admitting mistakes.

300
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,839
We tell you to be more sensitive,
you join Promise Keepers.

301
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:26,470
We say, "Get in touch with your
feelings." You run into the woods...

302
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:30,474
...gunking yourselves with bear fat,
beating a drum.

303
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,476
Don't ruin my evening.

304
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:34,311
- You know what I mean.
- Sure.

305
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,397
You want someone who's
sensitive to your needs...

306
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:41,026
...but still decisive enough for
a grope in the closet.

307
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:42,319
Yeah.

308
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:44,863
Something like that.

309
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,284
Oh, shit! That's all I need.

310
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,329
We were speeding?

311
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,331
I wasn't looking.

312
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:56,124
Pull over.

313
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,481
License and registration, please.

314
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:25,987
I'm sorry, officer.
Did I do something wrong?

315
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:28,407
Detective.

316
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:32,119
You crossed the double line,
have you been drinking?

317
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,037
We had wine with dinner.

318
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,914
Step out of the car, please.

319
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,999
I don't believe this.

320
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:42,129
Just relax, Randall,
and do what he says, okay?

321
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:49,219
I need you to walk a straight line
to me, sir. Heel to toe.

322
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,054
Look...

323
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:53,223
I applaud your vigilance.

324
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:55,600
But this is unnecessary, all right?

325
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:58,103
I'm a lawyer.
I know I'm under the limit.

326
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,147
- Open the trunk, please.
- What?

327
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:02,774
- You want to search my golf...?
- Open it!

328
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:04,151
I will not!

329
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:06,278
You ever hear of probable cause?

330
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:09,030
Oh, yeah, that's a real good legalese!

331
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:11,032
Are you resisting arrest?

332
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:12,868
Hey!

333
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:15,162
Vin, fucking cool it!

334
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:18,165
He can't do that!

335
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:21,251
- Back in the car!
- He didn't do anything wrong!

336
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:23,378
Back in the car, now!

337
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,714
Come on, let's go!

338
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,302
I perceived what I thought
was a weapon.

339
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,679
What the hell's wrong with you, Vin?

340
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:36,099
Take him. DUI, resisting arrest,
assaulting an officer.

341
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:38,518
- What's he...?
- Do it!

342
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,312
Jesus Christ!

343
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:45,525
Don't you touch me!

344
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:49,988
You got prime rib at home.
Don't be going out for hamburgers.

345
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:53,408
What? What are you talking about?

346
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,076
Randall!

347
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:57,329
Randall, I'll follow you!

348
00:24:57,497 --> 00:25:01,041
I'm gonna call my lawyer,
you fuck, you!

349
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,252
She's seeing a Randall Curtin,
tax lawyer.

350
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:06,254
He lives at...

351
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:10,050
...1242 Rennsalaer Road.

352
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,761
He's divorced, got two kids.

353
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:15,472
He's the country club type.

354
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,391
Not much in the balls department,
I might add.

355
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:19,851
What about her?

356
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:23,396
The good doctor, in her
office at 8 a.m., leaves at 6.

357
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:25,565
Orders a tuna sub and Diet Coke.

358
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:30,153
She's got a three-bedroom condo
in Essex Fells. Shops at Pathmark.

359
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:32,989
She's divorced, one kid, 19.

360
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:35,450
Outside of schmucko,
she don't get out much.

361
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,410
But she does see a shrink.

362
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:39,454
She what?

363
00:25:39,664 --> 00:25:43,875
Yeah, she sees a shrink, once a week.
His name is Elliot Kupferburg.

364
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:46,461
Fuck me!

365
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:49,631
She don't fuck anyone,
from what I can tell.

366
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,925
It's not because she don't
got the goods.

367
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:55,178
She left her blinds up, I got some of
them Victoria Secret-type snaps.

368
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,138
If you're interested.

369
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,848
A little a this?

370
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:01,643
- Good enough, then?
- Yeah.

371
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,353
You got any Advil?

372
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,355
What am I, a fucking pharmacy?

373
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:10,360
What you got on Friday's game?
I got three bills on Rutgers.

374
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,737
That'll solve all your problems.

375
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:23,665
Thank you.

376
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,002
With a stapler?!

377
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,255
I heard Mikey had to give up
that nice suit.

378
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:33,174
He got too attached to it.

379
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:38,513
Michael Palmice's been a disease since
he was 5, he had it coming.

380
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:40,599
It don't make things any easier.

381
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:44,019
- My uncle's stubborn.
- Stubborn enough to go to war?

382
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:51,192
What kind of a word is that?

383
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:54,112
There hasn't been a war
since the Columbo thing.

384
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:55,614
Everybody decided.

385
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:58,658
No one's going to the mattresses
these days.

386
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:02,537
I got a top-of-the-line Posturepedic
at my house. Fuck it.

387
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:06,958
If Jackie wasn't sick,
this wouldn't have happened.

388
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:08,376
You're right.

389
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,879
So one of us captains gotta step up.

390
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:13,006
Lack of control
is fucking up this family.

391
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,258
- That's true.
- You can say that again.

392
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:20,055
If the old man were here, instead
of in that cell in Springfield...

393
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:23,224
...he'd say, "Raymond,
this is your moment."

394
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:26,061
Go easy with the grease gun, okay?

395
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:30,899
You're the Boy Wonder. Him and Jackie
both had you picked from day one.

396
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,234
You got the age, the seniority.

397
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:36,571
I also got an 18-year-old
with MS, okay?

398
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:39,240
I told Nucci I'd be doing less,
not more.

399
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:43,578
All due respect to your crippled kid,
you don't want a wire up your ass.

400
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:46,748
That's why you should be boss,
you're so fucking smart.

401
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:50,210
And it's "physically challenged."

402
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:51,628
Absolutely.

403
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:55,757
Why don't we run it like a council?

404
00:27:56,008 --> 00:28:00,553
Larry, the old guys set this up
as a paramilitary organization.

405
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:04,391
We need a supreme commander,
not the fucking Dave Clark Five.

406
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:09,979
Face it, T. You and Junior
are gonna have to duke it out.

407
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:11,815
You've gotta be boss.

408
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:13,942
Number one, I'm not the man.

409
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:17,237
Number two,
he's got New York behind him.

410
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:19,948
Not for anything,
God bless your uncle...

411
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:23,201
...but he's living in the wrong
century. New York knows it.

412
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:28,081
You want it, T,
you'll get there okay.

413
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:31,543
It's the right thing.
It's inevitable.

414
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:34,087
I don't want no disturbance.

415
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,645
Hey, what's up?

416
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:52,397
Nothing.

417
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:55,650
Bet you told your mom what happened.

418
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,277
What are you, high?!

419
00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:02,323
Well, you owe me $40 for the shirt.
The collar was ripped.

420
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,492
You still owe me for 4th of July.

421
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:06,453
Bottle rockets? I paid for them.

422
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:10,498
Not for the M-80s. Remember,
the ones we blew up the frogs with?

423
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:13,001
Oh, yeah. That was pretty cool.

424
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:14,586
Yeah.

425
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:17,630
Just give me the money.

426
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,591
That thing was gay!
I did you a favor.

427
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:21,134
You're gonna do it!

428
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,261
Make me, fatty!

429
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,264
- Dickwad!
- Asshole!

430
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:28,141
Whoa!

431
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:33,062
Shithead!

432
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:36,191
Bitch! Come on.

433
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:39,068
Let's go, shithead!

434
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:42,071
- Let me go!
- So I can kick your ass again?

435
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,032
I was kicking your ass!

436
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,533
Nobody won, it was a draw.

437
00:29:45,743 --> 00:29:48,870
The Pit, tomorrow, 3:00.

438
00:29:50,873 --> 00:29:53,875
Help me with the chinch bugs,
they're killing my corn.

439
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:57,045
This stuff works pretty well.
It's safe for the environment.

440
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:58,713
I tried that.

441
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:01,674
You got any DDT back there?

442
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:04,010
That stuff's illegal,
it's been banned.

443
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,554
Maybe you have a little surplus
back there.

444
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:08,181
I'll meet you back there.

445
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:10,099
If I could help, I would...

446
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:14,062
Mr. Piocosta! Right?
How you doing?

447
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:20,109
You remember, our boys
went to Camp Aheka together?

448
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,403
- Of course, Tony. How are you?
- Good.

449
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:25,114
Your kid still got that killer
crossover dribble?

450
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:26,825
Yeah, I guess so.

451
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:28,576
That'll get him a scholarship.

452
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:30,036
So how's Anthony?

453
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:34,123
He's moody, you know.
For a kid that age, you know.

454
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:36,876
Nice seeing you, Tony.

455
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:40,129
Why don't we get together
and cook dogs for the boys?

456
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:45,552
Tony, I don't even know if
these guys are close anymore.

457
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,554
Did Anthony say anything?

458
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,056
I'll have Carmela call Joanie.

459
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:52,517
Linda.

460
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:57,438
That's great. Tony, that's great.
I'll see you around.

461
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:35,310
- Tony!
- Yeah?

462
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,479
Oh, my God! Tony!

463
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:46,821
I thought the medication was supposed
to help your panic attacks.

464
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:52,243
It does.
It's the first one in a while.

465
00:31:53,037 --> 00:31:57,040
What does your therapist say?
He should increase your dosage.

466
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,378
He's got more degrees than a
thermometer. Don't worry about it.

467
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:08,426
Does your therapist ask questions
about our marriage?

468
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:12,013
I know personal feelings
are hard for you to talk about.

469
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:14,265
That's all we do is talk.

470
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,645
Carm, I'm gonna quit.

471
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:24,275
- Did you bring this up with him?
- Yeah. He knows.

472
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:26,361
I guess.

473
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:32,659
I forgot to take my Prozac
this morning.

474
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:35,620
It's up in the bathroom,
can you get it?

475
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:42,043
I know with Jackie sick,
you're under tremendous pressure.

476
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:46,589
But I feel if the therapy didn't hurt,
it wouldn't be helping!

477
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:51,260
- You don't understand.
- That's why you're in therapy.

478
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:53,680
Because I don't understand!

479
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:58,267
I'm telling you, if you give up now,
I'll have to re-evaluate things.

480
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:00,645
What is that, huh?

481
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,482
I got a sensitive job,
I'm not an average Joe on the block.

482
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:06,359
It's our marriage, Tony!

483
00:33:06,694 --> 00:33:08,611
Therapy is too much exposure!

484
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:11,698
Fine!
You live with the results then.

485
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:14,742
What's that, a threat?

486
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:19,831
No, Tony, it's a rave review.
Get your own fucking pills.

487
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,422
How long did the attack last?

488
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:29,841
About 30 seconds.

489
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:35,430
I was dizzy, out of breath.
That's it, I never lost consciousness.

490
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:36,931
Anything since?

491
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:44,063
I'll write you a scrip for Xanax,
just for a couple of days.

492
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:47,775
It'll get you over
the short-term stresses.

493
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:54,699
My uncle's got me in a box where I
gotta do something I don't want to do.

494
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:01,789
Then there's my mother.

495
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:06,419
Four grand a month and she acts like
I'm an Eskimo, pushing her out to sea.

496
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:12,759
She's testing.

497
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:15,970
Same as your uncle.

498
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:19,140
Like little kids.

499
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:22,310
There's a good book about this.

500
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,645
No, I read, I go right out.

501
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,816
It's Strategies for Coping
with Elder Family.

502
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:32,987
You can't fucking spank them.

503
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:37,158
Would it hurt to let your mother
think she's still in charge?

504
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:40,119
You have children,
you know what they're like.

505
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:45,500
Sometimes it's important to let them
have the illusion of being in control.

506
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,013
Chris, my man!

507
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:00,431
Surprised to see me?

508
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:03,976
Heard they took you for a ride.
Tour of the Meadowlands.

509
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:07,647
Heard you had a little b.m.

510
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,441
- You got my cut?
- They came and took it.

511
00:35:11,235 --> 00:35:13,152
- Who?
- Junior Soprano's boys.

512
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:15,613
They said it's their corner now.

513
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:17,198
You let them?

514
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:19,700
I don't argue well
sucking on a Smith & Wesson.

515
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:22,161
- You didn't beep me?
- Word on the street...

516
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:25,832
...you out of commission.
Sorry, man, business.

517
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:32,088
You know, there's no one I'd rather
give my 10 points to than you.

518
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:36,175
It's all right. It's not your fault.

519
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:38,594
I'm glad to hear you say that, man.

520
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,721
Sneaky motherfucker.

521
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:44,100
Shit!

522
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:51,274
I don't care if they shove
a scud missile up your ass.

523
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:55,903
It's my corner. Pay anyone but me,
I'm coming back for your thumbs!

524
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,906
And that didn't happen, what you said!

525
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,581
I'm gonna kill you!

526
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:13,588
Good luck, A.J.

527
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:16,591
If you get in trouble,
go for the takedown.

528
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,136
Sweep kick and steamroll,
the game is over.

529
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:22,263
All you're doing is making me nervous.

530
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:25,391
- Want a Nitro bar?
- Would you shut the fuck up?

531
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,937
- He's coming!
- It's the moment of truth.

532
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:06,265
- Here.
- What the hell is that?

533
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:08,351
Just take it.

534
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:10,811
I'll fight you for it.

535
00:37:11,355 --> 00:37:12,605
I can't!

536
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:15,858
- What do you mean, can't?
- Just take it!

537
00:37:20,948 --> 00:37:22,406
I knew you'd chicken out.

538
00:37:28,205 --> 00:37:30,039
He chickened out, he's scared.

539
00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:32,250
He's real scared of you.

540
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:34,293
What's that supposed to mean?

541
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:36,837
You won, man!
Yeah, Tonio, you won!

542
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:38,297
I'm leaving.

543
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:20,423
One of gangland's
youngest alleged leaders...

544
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:23,759
...died late this afternoon
at St. Isaac's Hospital.

545
00:38:24,011 --> 00:38:25,928
Turn it off! Turn the music off!

546
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:28,222
One of the state's
top Mafia figures...

547
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:30,766
...was first hospitalized last year.

548
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:36,230
Authorities called Aprile the acting
boss for 74-year-old "Eckley" DeMeo...

549
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:40,234
...currently serving a life sentence
in Springfield Penitentiary.

550
00:38:40,444 --> 00:38:42,236
Authorities say he was made
acting boss...

551
00:38:42,446 --> 00:38:45,281
...for the North Jersey Mafia
two years ago.

552
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,908
Aprile was 44 years old.

553
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:54,957
Damn it, I was just there.
He told me he wouldn't go today.

554
00:38:57,753 --> 00:39:00,546
I'll never forget
where I was this day.

555
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:09,221
- Sorry, T.
- He was a good man.

556
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:15,394
Let's do a toast, give me a toast.

557
00:39:18,065 --> 00:39:20,941
To a great man.
To a great leader.

558
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:23,444
A great friend.

559
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:27,323
To Jackie.

560
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,659
Buon'anima.

561
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:37,875
T!

562
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,754
- You hear what happened?
- Just now.

563
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:46,217
That's not all! I go to make a pickup
from Yo Yo Mendez...

564
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:49,011
...he says it ain't my corner anymore.
It's Junior's.

565
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:51,013
Christopher, this ain't the time.

566
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:52,473
They're moving in!

567
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:55,601
I say we go to Def Con 4.

568
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:58,979
I gotta assess this, all right?

569
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:00,898
What are we, politicians?

570
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:03,109
Does this look like the Senate?

571
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,319
This is about respect of our thing!

572
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:07,488
Shut the fuck up!
It doesn't concern you!

573
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:12,159
I represent you, and I'm tired
of putting my tail between my legs!

574
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:14,328
This ain't negotiation time!

575
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:18,124
This is Scarface, final scene,
fucking bazookas under each arm.

576
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:20,000
"Say hello to my little friend!"

577
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:22,086
Always with the scenarios.

578
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:26,006
You don't do something,
I gotta question your leadership!

579
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:28,717
You ungrateful little fuck!

580
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,679
Where'd you get the balls
to question my leadership?

581
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,681
I'm just saying how it is!

582
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,851
I'll rip your fucking head off
and finish the job!

583
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,853
- You're the boss!
- That's right...

584
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:42,898
...I am. And you're lucky
a man I loved died today.

585
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:57,705
Here we go, war of '99.

586
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,206
We should go.

587
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:02,084
You do what you're told,
when you're told!

588
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,254
Adiós, Junior.

589
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:35,242
Uncle Junior...

590
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:37,828
...I need to talk to you.

591
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:45,419
I came in heavy, like you said,
but I don't want to use it.

592
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:05,147
Our friend Jackie has died.

593
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:08,651
I heard.

594
00:42:09,236 --> 00:42:10,986
And we need a leader.

595
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,365
We do.

596
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,580
I don't want any confusion
or misunderstanding.

597
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:23,249
Yes.

598
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:28,921
Sopranos have been waiting a long time
to take the reins.

599
00:42:34,928 --> 00:42:37,388
That's why I want it to be you,
Uncle Jun.

600
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:45,813
This is your decision?

601
00:42:46,273 --> 00:42:47,481
It is.

602
00:42:47,983 --> 00:42:49,650
You speak for the captains?

603
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:52,111
I can.

604
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,197
Come here.

605
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:58,492
You crazy cetriolo.

606
00:42:58,702 --> 00:43:00,452
You had me worried there.

607
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:03,080
You think I'm gonna mess
with a guy like you?

608
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:05,833
You been pumping iron?
Strong as a bull.

609
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:08,836
Call Parcells,
give this guy a tryout.

610
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:11,672
- Come here.
- Always the bullshitter.

611
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:14,091
Just one thing, one thing.

612
00:43:14,426 --> 00:43:17,469
You know I can't be perceived
to lose face, right?

613
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:20,014
So...

614
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,684
...Bloomfield...

615
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,062
...and the Paving Union.

616
00:43:27,314 --> 00:43:29,315
That's my asking price.

617
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:37,323
Congratulations.

618
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:42,494
You know the rules.

619
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,001
I almost got in a fight today.

620
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:50,461
Fight?

621
00:43:50,712 --> 00:43:52,713
With Jeremy Piocosta.

622
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:55,507
I take French with his brother,
he's such a poser.

623
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:59,553
- Who won?
- No one. He backed out.

624
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:02,431
Phil Litto said,
"Yeah, he's real scared of you."

625
00:44:02,641 --> 00:44:04,642
When I asked what that meant,
they all laughed.

626
00:44:04,893 --> 00:44:07,478
- Duh.
- What do you mean?

627
00:44:08,355 --> 00:44:10,606
Sometimes you're so naive.

628
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:12,900
What does Dad do for a living?

629
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:14,568
Waste management.

630
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,404
Do you know any other garbage men
who live like this?

631
00:44:17,656 --> 00:44:18,906
Uncle Jackie.

632
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:22,201
Why do we call him "uncle"
when he's not related?

633
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:26,080
He's in Dad's other family.

634
00:44:28,917 --> 00:44:30,250
Come here.

635
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:42,930
I'll print it out for you.

636
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:25,848
Hi!

637
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:27,641
Jennifer.

638
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,977
I tried calling.

639
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:33,480
Yeah, the phone's off the hook.
Come on in.

640
00:45:39,821 --> 00:45:42,448
I guess we won't be going to dinner.

641
00:45:43,116 --> 00:45:44,908
I'm worried, Jennifer.

642
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:51,039
I think I'm starting to lose it.

643
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:54,251
I was standing in line
in the doughnut shop.

644
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:56,211
A man in a booth looked at me.

645
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:59,673
All of a sudden,
I started shaking uncontrollably.

646
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:02,259
The lady says "next," I ran away.

647
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:06,597
Hey...

648
00:46:07,474 --> 00:46:11,602
You've been through a very
traumatic experience.

649
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:15,355
I hate to admit this...

650
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:18,859
...but I'm afraid to go outside.

651
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:26,033
I got this crazy idea
that I'm being followed.

652
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:30,162
And this song keeps
running through my head.

653
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:33,290
"People are Strange," The Doors.

654
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:38,670
Where, "faces look evil
when you're alienated."

655
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,172
Randall...

656
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,301
Dead at 27 in a Paris bathtub.

657
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:47,679
I think you should go
and talk to Mel Gelbar.

658
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:51,225
He specializes in post-traumatic
stress disorder.

659
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:54,436
You couldn't prescribe something?

660
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:56,897
I'm your date, not your doctor.

661
00:46:57,482 --> 00:47:00,651
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah. No.

662
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,893
Saw my first dead body
when I was about 15.

663
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:36,812
Maybe 16.

664
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:40,816
I won't tell you about how he
got clipped because it was...

665
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:45,654
Sorry.

666
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:47,406
You okay?

667
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:50,117
I was thinking...

668
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:54,580
I guess I live a sheltered existence.

669
00:47:54,831 --> 00:47:56,206
How so?

670
00:47:59,127 --> 00:48:01,712
I'm in this room for 10 hours a day.

671
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:07,801
I guess I'm out of touch with the
climate of rage in American society...

672
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:12,723
...the casual violence.

673
00:48:14,142 --> 00:48:16,143
Your voice is all tight.

674
00:48:20,607 --> 00:48:24,651
This week my, my friend got beat up...

675
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:27,321
...by a policeman, no less.

676
00:48:29,616 --> 00:48:30,824
Oh, yeah?

677
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:33,452
It was a nightmare.

678
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:37,247
Wow.

679
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:43,462
I mean, I don't know if this cop
was crazy or drunk or what.

680
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:48,842
But he was raving, "prime rib,
hamburger," it was surreal.

681
00:48:50,011 --> 00:48:51,887
Fucking moron.

682
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:59,102
I mean, it sounds like this guy
is a fucking moron.

683
00:48:59,354 --> 00:49:02,522
My friend's filing suit
against the city.

684
00:49:02,774 --> 00:49:06,652
The worst part of it is, our
relationship will never be the same.

685
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:08,362
Sorry.

686
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:10,656
Oh, it wasn't your fault!

687
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:14,910
Hey, this is your session.

688
00:49:15,203 --> 00:49:17,371
I'm, I'm sorry, this is...

689
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,414
...very unprofessional.

690
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:22,876
It's all right,
you had your wits scared out of you.

691
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:25,671
Is the Xanax helping?

692
00:49:27,006 --> 00:49:29,049
It's fine, no more attacks.

693
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:33,845
But you still have your doubts?

694
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:38,809
About therapy? No, no, no, no.

695
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:43,063
Giving it another chance.
Get a lot of good ideas here.

696
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:46,066
Okay.

697
00:49:46,401 --> 00:49:48,068
On how to cope.

698
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:57,369
Tell me why this was a smart move,
to make Junior the Big Willie.

699
00:49:57,578 --> 00:50:01,873
Look at him. He's content.
Thinks he's the king of kings.

700
00:50:04,252 --> 00:50:06,628
Truth is, every decision
is made by me.

701
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:08,880
I still worry about the money end.

702
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:11,425
That's what you do, you worry.

703
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:14,428
He doesn't know what
we kick back to Jackie.

704
00:50:15,722 --> 00:50:17,180
We're gonna do good.

705
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:22,394
The point is, he's got the title.
He's a happy fucking camper.

706
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:24,229
The house is secure.

707
00:50:24,856 --> 00:50:28,442
Now we got a brand-new lightning rod
on top to take the hits.

708
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:30,610
Smart. Very smart.

709
00:50:30,862 --> 00:50:34,239
Yeah, and now you got Bloomfield
and the union chair.

710
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:37,325
Otherwise you'd fuck me, but you
wouldn't respect me in the morning.

711
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:41,788
As long as you guarantee to keep
the old fart in line.

712
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:45,250
I still love that man.
I'm his favorite nephew.

713
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:48,045
Look at him, over there with my ma.

714
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:50,922
Those people
went through World War II.

715
00:51:19,452 --> 00:51:22,704
T, check out the government.

716
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:28,627
Shooting right to left.

717
00:51:29,087 --> 00:51:31,004
They got Uncle Jun's good side.


1
00:01:53,532 --> 00:01:54,741
How'd it go?

2
00:01:54,992 --> 00:01:58,161
They've got a 48 to 52 male/female
ratio, which is great.

3
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:01,873
A strong liberal arts program
and the Olin Arts Center for music.

4
00:02:02,082 --> 00:02:04,375
The usual programs abroad
are China, India...

5
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:06,878
You're just applying.
Already you're leaving?

6
00:02:07,087 --> 00:02:09,714
It's an option, Dad. Junior year.

7
00:02:09,923 --> 00:02:13,426
What'll you study in India?
How not to get diarrhea?

8
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:17,263
They don't require SAT scores,
but mine are high.

9
00:02:17,473 --> 00:02:18,973
Socially, I don't know.

10
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:20,892
I heard there's a saying:

11
00:02:21,101 --> 00:02:24,687
"Bates is the world's most expensive
form of contraception."

12
00:02:25,272 --> 00:02:26,522
What kind of talk is that?

13
00:02:26,774 --> 00:02:29,108
The girls at the other
colleges put out?

14
00:02:29,652 --> 00:02:30,694
Oh, my God.

15
00:02:34,532 --> 00:02:35,949
It's pretty, huh?

16
00:02:36,785 --> 00:02:38,077
Yeah.

17
00:02:39,621 --> 00:02:41,163
Two to go. Colby up.

18
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,210
Dad, how come you
didn't finish college?

19
00:02:46,503 --> 00:02:48,712
I had a semester and a half
at Seton Hall.

20
00:02:49,422 --> 00:02:50,714
Yeah, and?

21
00:02:52,008 --> 00:02:54,134
My parents
didn't stress college.

22
00:02:54,344 --> 00:02:56,303
They were working-class people.

23
00:02:56,554 --> 00:02:58,806
How come they were
anti-education?

24
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,225
They weren't "anti."

25
00:03:01,935 --> 00:03:04,144
You can't lay it all off on them.

26
00:03:04,646 --> 00:03:06,897
I got into trouble
when I was a kid.

27
00:03:07,148 --> 00:03:09,024
- I heard.
- You did?

28
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:11,693
In Waterville,
dine at the Stone House.

29
00:03:11,945 --> 00:03:14,530
Serving the freshest
Maine lobsters.

30
00:03:14,823 --> 00:03:17,991
Come see our new salad bar,
featuring a wonderful...

31
00:03:29,504 --> 00:03:30,754
Are you in the Mafia?

32
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:34,299
Am I in the what?

33
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,718
Whatever, organized crime?

34
00:03:39,597 --> 00:03:41,515
That's crap. Who told you that?

35
00:03:41,684 --> 00:03:43,685
I've lived in the house
all my life.

36
00:03:43,936 --> 00:03:46,980
I've seen police come,
I've seen you go out at 3 a.m.

37
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:50,608
You never seen Doc Cusamano
go out at 3 a.m. on a call?

38
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,361
The Cusamano kids
ever find $50,000...

39
00:03:53,612 --> 00:03:56,281
...and a.45 while hunting
for Easter eggs?

40
00:03:56,532 --> 00:04:00,285
In the waste management business,
everybody assumes you're mobbed up.

41
00:04:00,536 --> 00:04:03,204
It's a stereotype, and it's offensive.

42
00:04:03,497 --> 00:04:05,540
You're the last person I want
to perpetuate it.

43
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,208
Fine.

44
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:12,046
There is no Mafia.

45
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,515
All right, look...

46
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:25,560
...Med, you're a grown woman.

47
00:04:25,853 --> 00:04:27,270
Almost.

48
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:30,565
Some of my money...

49
00:04:31,692 --> 00:04:34,569
...comes from illegal gambling
and whatnot.

50
00:04:41,118 --> 00:04:42,702
How does that make you feel?

51
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:46,706
At least you don't keep
denying it like Mom.

52
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,375
Kids in school think it's neat.

53
00:04:49,585 --> 00:04:51,169
Seen The Godfather, right?

54
00:04:51,587 --> 00:04:54,923
Casino we like. Sharon Stone,
'70s clothes, pills.

55
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:58,344
I'm not asking about those bums.
I'm asking about you.

56
00:04:58,762 --> 00:05:01,222
Sometimes I wish you were
like other dads.

57
00:05:01,431 --> 00:05:04,934
But then like, Mr. Scangarelo,
for example.

58
00:05:05,227 --> 00:05:09,438
An advertising executive
for big tobacco. Or lawyers? Ugh.

59
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:12,066
- So many dads are full of shit.
- I'm not?

60
00:05:12,526 --> 00:05:14,944
You finally told the truth about this.

61
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:24,119
Look, Med, part of my income
comes from legitimate businesses.

62
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:25,579
The stock market...

63
00:05:25,872 --> 00:05:29,750
Look, Dad, please.
Don't start mealy-mouthing.

64
00:05:37,092 --> 00:05:38,300
How's my sweetheart?

65
00:05:38,552 --> 00:05:41,303
I'm so pissed, I can hardly see.

66
00:05:41,555 --> 00:05:42,805
You getting the flu?

67
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:45,307
No. That's my cousin, Svetlana.

68
00:05:45,475 --> 00:05:46,475
The amputee?

69
00:05:46,643 --> 00:05:50,604
Two months she's only in America,
and she's already getting married.

70
00:05:50,897 --> 00:05:54,316
You knew the deal. I got two kids.
We talked about this.

71
00:05:54,568 --> 00:05:59,154
Yes, and a wife whenever you want.
What do I have in my life?

72
00:05:59,406 --> 00:06:00,698
Am I glad I called.

73
00:06:00,865 --> 00:06:03,325
Fuck you, then! Hang up!

74
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:05,537
How are the whirlpool jets?

75
00:06:05,746 --> 00:06:08,665
Don't throw up in my face
things you buy me.

76
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:12,669
Her prosthetic leg fell off
in a Gap store...

77
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,214
...and he carries her
out like a knight...

78
00:06:16,424 --> 00:06:18,466
...in a white satin armor.

79
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:21,845
I gotta go, my daughter's coming.

80
00:06:24,056 --> 00:06:25,724
Jesus!

81
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,275
How you feeling?

82
00:06:35,484 --> 00:06:40,196
Better, actually. Fever just broke.
I miss you two.

83
00:06:40,448 --> 00:06:43,742
- How's the interviews going?
- Good, real good.

84
00:06:43,951 --> 00:06:45,201
Did she like Bates?

85
00:06:46,245 --> 00:06:49,456
Anything to get her
off of this Berkeley kick.

86
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,250
What the fuck?

87
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,878
Tony?

88
00:06:55,463 --> 00:06:56,755
Yeah. Yeah.

89
00:06:57,048 --> 00:06:59,257
Look, I'll call you from the motel.

90
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,400
Meadow! Come on!

91
00:07:25,118 --> 00:07:29,121
- Come on, get in.
- Okay, okay, what's the rush?

92
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,125
Jesus, Dad!

93
00:07:39,174 --> 00:07:40,675
What's going on?

94
00:07:41,885 --> 00:07:43,552
I think I saw an old friend.

95
00:07:43,762 --> 00:07:45,680
You know that guy?

96
00:07:46,264 --> 00:07:48,474
Maybe not. Probably not.

97
00:07:48,725 --> 00:07:50,309
Then what?

98
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,104
Dad, slow down!

99
00:07:57,776 --> 00:08:00,444
- Jesus, what's with you?!
- It's all right.

100
00:08:00,696 --> 00:08:02,530
Fucking maniac!

101
00:08:03,323 --> 00:08:06,117
- What's going on?
- Just fooling around.

102
00:08:11,748 --> 00:08:13,457
Colby! Turn!

103
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:15,543
Colby! Turn left, it's left!

104
00:08:17,921 --> 00:08:19,547
Dad!

105
00:08:20,507 --> 00:08:22,466
That's because you're talking.

106
00:08:29,934 --> 00:08:31,977
This gets us to Colby anyhow.

107
00:08:36,357 --> 00:08:37,649
Dad, that's our motel.

108
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,777
Our motel's right there.

109
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:49,244
- Did you know that guy?
- It wasn't him.

110
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:02,674
Bada-bing.

111
00:09:02,925 --> 00:09:04,342
Take this number down.

112
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:05,886
Now? It's pouring.

113
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:09,097
207-555-0185.

114
00:09:12,101 --> 00:09:16,688
Bonjour. Room service est arrivé.

115
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:23,612
Why, thank you, kind sir.

116
00:09:29,118 --> 00:09:31,119
What? You said poached eggs.

117
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,123
You're not eating,
after all that work?

118
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,959
My eyes were bigger than my stomach.

119
00:09:45,928 --> 00:09:48,888
Why don't you go over to Jason's,
play Nintendo.

120
00:09:50,974 --> 00:09:54,268
Nope, no kisses. Cooties.

121
00:09:54,478 --> 00:09:55,937
I'll be back in an hour.

122
00:09:56,146 --> 00:09:57,563
Okay.

123
00:10:10,953 --> 00:10:13,246
Oh, motherfucker.

124
00:10:14,957 --> 00:10:16,958
Motherfucking shit.

125
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:23,673
I'm not sure, but I think
I saw Fabian Petrulio.

126
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:26,175
- Refresh my memory.
- Before your time?

127
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:29,971
Made guy, flipped 10 years ago.
He got busted for peddling H.

128
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,806
Took out a lot of people.

129
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:33,683
People from our outfit.

130
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:36,978
My old man was sick. He never
recovered when he heard.

131
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:38,563
You saw this guy?

132
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:41,190
I'm saying I think I did,
but I'm not sure.

133
00:10:41,483 --> 00:10:43,276
Up in Maine? What the fuck?

134
00:10:43,485 --> 00:10:46,195
He was in the witness-protection
program. Then they kicked him out.

135
00:10:46,405 --> 00:10:48,698
He goes to colleges and gets paid...

136
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,993
...to talk about what
a big Mafioso he was.

137
00:10:51,202 --> 00:10:52,286
Piece of shit.

138
00:10:52,495 --> 00:10:55,289
We partied, but Jackie Aprile
knew him good.

139
00:10:55,498 --> 00:10:57,541
They did time in Lewisburg.

140
00:10:57,792 --> 00:11:00,752
You know that bust
in his rec room with Sinatra?

141
00:11:00,962 --> 00:11:02,963
Febbie made it
in a prison workshop.

142
00:11:03,298 --> 00:11:06,967
That was Frank? I always
thought it was Shaquille.

143
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,261
Fucker needs to practice on lips.

144
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,306
I know. Anyway, run these
plates for me.

145
00:11:13,641 --> 00:11:14,975
Go ahead.

146
00:11:15,143 --> 00:11:19,980
"Maine, DX66920," call you back
tonight at 10, all right?

147
00:11:23,776 --> 00:11:25,777
What's wrong with the phone
in your room?

148
00:11:25,987 --> 00:11:30,324
Nothing. Just taking a walk, saw it,
figured I'd call Christopher.

149
00:11:30,575 --> 00:11:31,783
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

150
00:11:31,993 --> 00:11:33,285
Everything okay?

151
00:11:33,494 --> 00:11:35,996
They got a leak in the roof,
all right?

152
00:11:41,294 --> 00:11:44,379
- Who is it?
- Father Phil.

153
00:11:44,797 --> 00:11:48,675
Just a second. Oh, Jesus.

154
00:12:12,493 --> 00:12:16,996
- Oh, my God. Look at you!
- I hope I'm not barging in.

155
00:12:17,289 --> 00:12:19,499
No. I was watching TV.

156
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:23,086
I was at the clothing drive.
I thought you were in Maine.

157
00:12:23,337 --> 00:12:26,965
Your Moschino peddle-pusher
suit, it flew out of there.

158
00:12:27,257 --> 00:12:29,092
Good, good, good!

159
00:12:29,301 --> 00:12:31,761
Anyway, Jean Cusamano
said you were ill.

160
00:12:31,971 --> 00:12:34,597
Yes, I was.
The flu that was going around.

161
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:38,393
- Yipes!
- Yeah, I still have a little fever.

162
00:12:38,602 --> 00:12:41,771
I also have a confession to make, Carm.

163
00:12:45,943 --> 00:12:48,987
I have a jones for your baked ziti.

164
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:52,490
I have some in the freezer.
I can reheat it.

165
00:12:52,741 --> 00:12:54,742
It's so much better that way.

166
00:12:55,202 --> 00:12:58,121
- The mozzarella gets nice and chewy.
- I like that.

167
00:12:58,372 --> 00:13:01,416
I was having some Fernet.
Would you like something?

168
00:13:01,917 --> 00:13:03,292
Some wine, if it's open.

169
00:13:04,336 --> 00:13:06,754
So how's Med and Tony's trip going?

170
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:11,467
I should know? He doesn't have time
to talk to me for two minutes.

171
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,852
Stop staring.
Why are you doing that?

172
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:22,312
It's an exciting time.

173
00:13:23,273 --> 00:13:25,107
I can't tell you how proud I am.

174
00:13:25,358 --> 00:13:27,985
A real student at Casa Soprano.

175
00:13:28,611 --> 00:13:31,572
And she looks like a model
out of Italian Vogue.

176
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:34,450
Italian, Italian, Italian.
Thank you.

177
00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:38,287
You're up to something.

178
00:13:39,706 --> 00:13:41,665
How'd you get so cynical?

179
00:13:47,464 --> 00:13:50,716
That stuff we talked about.
How's that sitting with you?

180
00:13:51,384 --> 00:13:53,469
Not like I wasn't 90% sure already.

181
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,180
What about your brother?
Does he know?

182
00:13:56,473 --> 00:13:58,015
I think so.

183
00:13:59,225 --> 00:14:02,978
There was a time when Italian people
didn't have a lot of options.

184
00:14:03,772 --> 00:14:06,065
You mean like Mario Cuomo?

185
00:14:06,941 --> 00:14:08,150
Sorry.

186
00:14:11,154 --> 00:14:12,988
I put food on the table.

187
00:14:13,281 --> 00:14:16,325
My father was in it,
my uncle was in it.

188
00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:19,495
Maybe I was too lazy
to think for myself.

189
00:14:19,746 --> 00:14:23,165
Considered myself a rebel.

190
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:27,337
Being a rebel in my family would
have been selling patio furniture.

191
00:14:29,882 --> 00:14:32,342
In college, nothing interested you?

192
00:14:33,177 --> 00:14:34,886
I barely got in.

193
00:14:35,888 --> 00:14:38,515
Well, I kind of liked history.

194
00:14:38,766 --> 00:14:39,891
Yeah?

195
00:14:40,726 --> 00:14:43,186
Napoleon, The Roman Empire.

196
00:14:43,354 --> 00:14:45,522
The Potsdam Conference,
that stuff.

197
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:47,065
The Potsdam Conference?

198
00:14:47,691 --> 00:14:51,111
- Potsdamned if I know now.
- Oh, my God.

199
00:14:56,534 --> 00:14:58,409
I have something to tell you.

200
00:14:59,703 --> 00:15:01,121
Yeah?

201
00:15:03,874 --> 00:15:05,166
You're not?

202
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:07,043
No. Jesus.

203
00:15:10,881 --> 00:15:15,844
A couple of weeks ago, me and some
friends, we were doing speed.

204
00:15:16,053 --> 00:15:18,555
- We did a lot for a while.
- You what?

205
00:15:19,557 --> 00:15:24,060
It was just between homework and SATs
and the general pressure of life...

206
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,520
We needed something.

207
00:15:25,729 --> 00:15:27,772
- That crap'll kill you!
- I know.

208
00:15:28,065 --> 00:15:30,525
I ought to slap you.
Where'd you get it?

209
00:15:30,734 --> 00:15:33,194
If I knew I'd get a lecture,
I wouldn't have told.

210
00:15:33,487 --> 00:15:36,990
Reality check! What do you think
I'd say? Where did you get it?

211
00:15:37,284 --> 00:15:40,161
I'm not telling.
Especially after this reaction.

212
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,871
Why did you tell me?

213
00:15:43,915 --> 00:15:46,167
You were honest with me today.

214
00:15:46,376 --> 00:15:48,544
I won't do it again.
It got too scary.

215
00:15:49,754 --> 00:15:52,173
Jesus, right under my nose.

216
00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:54,008
You'd think you'd know.

217
00:15:55,552 --> 00:15:57,303
No, Dad. You won't.

218
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:07,521
Well, I'm glad you told me.
In spite of everything.

219
00:16:08,106 --> 00:16:11,942
I'm glad too. I'm glad we have
that kind of relationship.

220
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:22,369
Tony hates building fires.

221
00:16:22,662 --> 00:16:26,790
We have this beautiful fireplace
with logs from when Lincoln split them.

222
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:30,127
Fear of fire is good
to keep out of hell.

223
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:33,631
Well, maybe there is hope for him.

224
00:16:34,466 --> 00:16:38,677
I got something for you.
It's what we were talking about.

225
00:16:38,887 --> 00:16:41,138
The chapter on Buddhism
is spectacular.

226
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:43,682
But I don't want you
going over to them.

227
00:16:43,934 --> 00:16:48,145
Fat chance. I could never just
sit on the floor and think of nothing.

228
00:16:48,356 --> 00:16:50,315
- Thank you.
- Sure.

229
00:16:50,566 --> 00:16:55,737
You'll see how Islam has gotten
a bad rap in current culture...

230
00:16:56,155 --> 00:16:59,699
Boy, this Chianti, though,
is beyond reproach.

231
00:16:59,909 --> 00:17:01,493
Word up.

232
00:17:05,957 --> 00:17:07,999
- Dad.
- I thought you fell in.

233
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,337
This is Carrie and Lucinda.

234
00:17:13,047 --> 00:17:14,339
They go to Colby.

235
00:17:14,507 --> 00:17:16,341
Why not hang out with them?

236
00:17:16,842 --> 00:17:17,842
Dad.

237
00:17:18,135 --> 00:17:20,178
What better way to
learn about the college?

238
00:17:20,763 --> 00:17:22,514
Yeah, maybe.

239
00:17:22,765 --> 00:17:24,349
No, that'd be cool.

240
00:17:24,642 --> 00:17:25,850
Please excuse him.

241
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,645
No, really, we love
to dish the school.

242
00:17:29,981 --> 00:17:32,357
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

243
00:17:32,525 --> 00:17:35,902
No drinking. Girls, you see
that she sticks to Cokes.

244
00:17:36,862 --> 00:17:39,531
I'll come back in an hour and a half.
Be good.

245
00:17:47,373 --> 00:17:49,374
- What have you got?
- Wet shoes.

246
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:52,544
Don't want to work in the rain,
try out for the Yankees.

247
00:17:52,753 --> 00:17:55,130
The car is registered
to Fredrick Peters...

248
00:17:55,381 --> 00:17:58,174
...38 Washington Street,
Waterville, Maine.

249
00:17:58,385 --> 00:18:00,553
It's off Route 201.
I looked it up.

250
00:18:01,054 --> 00:18:05,224
Fredrick Peters, Fabian Petrulio.
Good match, huh?

251
00:18:05,434 --> 00:18:09,061
I guess, I don't know.
T, what are you going to do?

252
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:13,024
I don't know. I got Meadow here.

253
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:14,525
Jesus.

254
00:18:14,735 --> 00:18:17,320
If you want, I'll fly up
and take care of it.

255
00:18:18,238 --> 00:18:19,530
Ah, you're a good kid.

256
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,116
You stay put.
Call Pussy or Paulie.

257
00:18:22,326 --> 00:18:24,910
- They can but I can't?
- Don't be sensitive.

258
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,371
They had a friend die in prison
due to him.

259
00:18:27,664 --> 00:18:28,873
I'll let them know.

260
00:18:29,082 --> 00:18:32,126
I gotta do my homework
and positively I.D. this guy.

261
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:33,836
I thought it was him.

262
00:18:34,087 --> 00:18:36,130
I haven't seen him in 12 years.

263
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,884
I'll call you around midnight.
Sit tight.

264
00:18:47,142 --> 00:18:49,060
You think I'm a schnorrer?

265
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:50,728
A who?

266
00:18:50,937 --> 00:18:55,691
Yiddish. Means somebody who always
shows up in time for free grub.

267
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,985
No, you're here a lot.

268
00:18:58,278 --> 00:19:00,654
But you're a man, you like to eat.

269
00:19:02,699 --> 00:19:04,950
I can't get over you
with that Yiddish.

270
00:19:05,202 --> 00:19:10,039
My neighborhood in Yonkers was mixed
Jewish and Italian, you know?

271
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,292
A heady brew.

272
00:19:12,502 --> 00:19:14,044
What does that mean, "heady"?

273
00:19:14,295 --> 00:19:18,256
You know, melting pot. Vigor.

274
00:19:24,013 --> 00:19:25,263
Hello.

275
00:19:25,515 --> 00:19:27,057
I'm calling for Tony Soprano.

276
00:19:27,308 --> 00:19:28,725
Cajun stuffed olives?

277
00:19:29,018 --> 00:19:30,268
Who can I say is calling?

278
00:19:30,478 --> 00:19:31,895
This is Dr. Melfi.

279
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:33,313
His nurse?

280
00:19:33,564 --> 00:19:36,358
No, is this Mrs. Soprano?

281
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:38,568
That's right, and you are?

282
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,737
Jennifer Melfi. Dr. Melfi?

283
00:19:40,988 --> 00:19:43,323
Jennifer, lovely name.

284
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,742
He's not home.

285
00:19:45,993 --> 00:19:49,162
Could I impose on you to tell him...

286
00:19:49,372 --> 00:19:53,500
...I need to reschedule Monday's
appointment? I'm down with the flu.

287
00:19:53,709 --> 00:19:55,085
Does he have your number?

288
00:19:55,336 --> 00:19:56,962
Let me give it to you.

289
00:19:57,171 --> 00:19:59,673
I lost my pencil, up his ass.

290
00:19:59,924 --> 00:20:01,591
I'll tell him you called.

291
00:20:09,767 --> 00:20:11,768
Why does he have to lie?

292
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,564
Why couldn't he tell me
his therapist is a woman?

293
00:20:15,773 --> 00:20:18,775
Maybe he did tell you,
and you didn't hear him.

294
00:20:19,862 --> 00:20:22,697
Why wouldn't he tell me,
unless he's screwing her?

295
00:20:23,031 --> 00:20:25,116
Carmela, please.

296
00:20:26,118 --> 00:20:27,743
I thought he was changing.

297
00:20:28,203 --> 00:20:32,540
I thought therapy would help clear up
the fucking freak show in his head.

298
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:35,418
I'm sure you're wrong
about them.

299
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,296
Therapy is a start.
It's a good start.

300
00:20:38,547 --> 00:20:41,716
But, yes, it doesn't fix the soul.

301
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:45,094
He'll need help
from other sources to repair that.

302
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:47,722
Then you talk to him!
You help him!

303
00:20:47,931 --> 00:20:50,016
But, well, there you go.

304
00:20:50,225 --> 00:20:52,143
I mean, will he listen?

305
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,731
He must be a very unhappy man.

306
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:01,486
He's unhappy?!
Sleep is my number one... Ah, shit!

307
00:21:03,071 --> 00:21:04,780
Why go into it?

308
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:30,097
- Mommy!
- Yes, bear?

309
00:21:30,349 --> 00:21:32,517
Would you put me to bed? I'm scared.

310
00:21:32,727 --> 00:21:34,353
Sure, honey, hold on.

311
00:21:34,812 --> 00:21:37,773
- I thought she was sleeping.
- Well, she woke up.

312
00:21:37,982 --> 00:21:41,026
Daddy's gonna come too.
We'll both put you to bed.

313
00:21:41,236 --> 00:21:43,028
- Hurry, Daddy.
- Yeah, yeah.

314
00:22:18,106 --> 00:22:21,275
These red pepper flakes
make all the difference.

315
00:22:21,693 --> 00:22:22,985
Spicy.

316
00:22:23,194 --> 00:22:28,323
As good as Willem Dafoe was, I cannot
picture that Jesus looked like him.

317
00:22:28,741 --> 00:22:30,409
Could you pass the cheese?

318
00:22:31,286 --> 00:22:33,161
Not that he didn't do well...

319
00:22:33,329 --> 00:22:35,205
...but the story's confusing.

320
00:22:35,415 --> 00:22:37,916
He gets down off the cross?

321
00:22:40,503 --> 00:22:42,671
Originally, Bobby D.
was to have that role.

322
00:22:42,923 --> 00:22:44,173
Really?

323
00:22:45,134 --> 00:22:46,342
Different picture.

324
00:22:46,635 --> 00:22:48,386
Oh, totally.

325
00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:51,931
"You talking to me, Pilate?

326
00:22:52,141 --> 00:22:55,435
You must be talking to me.
I don't see nobody else here...

327
00:22:55,686 --> 00:22:58,187
...except Barabbas, here."

328
00:22:58,689 --> 00:23:00,440
You know what's remarkable?

329
00:23:00,691 --> 00:23:03,568
If you take everything Jesus
ever said, add it up...

330
00:23:03,861 --> 00:23:05,862
...it amounts
to two hours of talk.

331
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,280
No!

332
00:23:07,531 --> 00:23:10,033
I heard the same thing
about the Beatles.

333
00:23:10,284 --> 00:23:13,870
Except if you add up all their
songs, it comes to 10 hours.

334
00:23:17,374 --> 00:23:19,000
Yes.

335
00:23:21,879 --> 00:23:24,505
It wasn't just what Christ said,
it was his deeds.

336
00:23:25,257 --> 00:23:27,091
See, that's my question.

337
00:23:27,301 --> 00:23:31,012
I understand what he did, but a lot
of what he said, I don't get.

338
00:23:31,555 --> 00:23:36,267
Like, "The sun rises on the just
and the unjust alike?" Why?

339
00:23:36,518 --> 00:23:39,062
Because, Christ was saying
that we're all...

340
00:23:39,313 --> 00:23:41,898
Whores will go to Heaven
before the righteous?

341
00:23:42,733 --> 00:23:44,108
That's not right.

342
00:23:44,318 --> 00:23:47,320
Father, we got
some major contradictions here.

343
00:23:49,531 --> 00:23:51,908
It's about love.
See it that way.

344
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,743
What does that mean?

345
00:23:54,037 --> 00:23:55,704
It means...

346
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:59,917
...hopefully someday
we will learn to tolerate...

347
00:24:00,126 --> 00:24:03,295
...accept and forgive
those that are different.

348
00:24:07,467 --> 00:24:09,134
Change through love.

349
00:24:17,977 --> 00:24:19,269
Well.

350
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,481
I better get going.

351
00:24:22,691 --> 00:24:24,358
Where you going?
You just got here.

352
00:24:24,651 --> 00:24:26,110
It's getting late.

353
00:24:26,569 --> 00:24:28,362
Well, it's pouring rain out.

354
00:24:28,613 --> 00:24:31,990
I know you love the DVD player.
I got Remains of the Day.

355
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:36,203
See, do I know you?

356
00:24:36,705 --> 00:24:38,706
Anything with Emma Thompson.

357
00:24:38,915 --> 00:24:40,874
I didn't know you looked.

358
00:24:41,126 --> 00:24:42,376
What?

359
00:24:43,128 --> 00:24:46,088
To take in through the eyes
a beautiful woman...

360
00:24:46,548 --> 00:24:51,176
...is that different than a sunset?
A Douglas fir?

361
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,721
Or any of God's handiwork?

362
00:25:44,815 --> 00:25:47,025
- Hey, Fred.
- Tanky, what do you say?

363
00:25:47,276 --> 00:25:49,402
You gonna give away
homemade cheese this year?

364
00:25:49,695 --> 00:25:52,113
For what they get for cream,
I don't know.

365
00:25:52,364 --> 00:25:56,493
Tank, anybody been looking for me
or asking any questions about me?

366
00:25:56,702 --> 00:25:58,369
Big guy, New York sounding?

367
00:25:58,537 --> 00:26:00,121
Is there a problem?

368
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:05,543
No. Dipshit hit me with his boat
while I was tubing on Caribou Lake.

369
00:26:05,878 --> 00:26:07,462
Claims it was my fault.

370
00:26:07,713 --> 00:26:10,298
If he shows up,
do you want me to call?

371
00:26:10,883 --> 00:26:13,301
Yeah, I wouldn't mind.
Do that, thanks.

372
00:27:17,284 --> 00:27:19,368
No one's asking for you, Fred.

373
00:27:19,661 --> 00:27:21,495
All right, Vitus. Thanks.

374
00:28:06,208 --> 00:28:07,459
Hello, rat.

375
00:28:45,499 --> 00:28:47,249
Please leave me alone.

376
00:28:47,501 --> 00:28:49,877
Why won't you show me your book?

377
00:28:50,087 --> 00:28:52,546
This is my private time.
You're invading it.

378
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:54,382
Oh, is that so?

379
00:28:54,716 --> 00:28:57,551
- I'm invading your private time?
- Yes.

380
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,556
What's in that book?
Come on, let me see.

381
00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:06,936
Or are you protecting me,
is that what you're doing?

382
00:29:08,021 --> 00:29:09,647
Would I be shocked?

383
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,401
Would it ruin my character?

384
00:29:16,863 --> 00:29:18,239
Let me see it.

385
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:41,971
Father, turn it off.
I can't handle it.

386
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:45,349
What? What is it?

387
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,185
Oh, Father, I'm a terrible person.

388
00:29:48,729 --> 00:29:53,441
Oh, no. You're a wonderful woman.

389
00:29:53,693 --> 00:29:56,903
It's been building in me.
I need to get it out.

390
00:29:57,155 --> 00:29:58,864
There's so much in me, I...

391
00:29:59,782 --> 00:30:04,494
- I want to...
- Carmela, if I can help, please.

392
00:30:08,082 --> 00:30:09,499
How?

393
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:17,924
How long since you last confessed?

394
00:30:21,387 --> 00:30:23,096
I, uh...

395
00:30:23,347 --> 00:30:25,182
If you'd like, I can do this.

396
00:30:28,311 --> 00:30:29,728
You mean here? Now?

397
00:30:30,146 --> 00:30:34,941
The whole world is God's house.
He hears and sees everything.

398
00:31:00,468 --> 00:31:03,678
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

399
00:31:04,264 --> 00:31:08,768
It has been four weeks since my last
confession... What am I talking about?

400
00:31:09,061 --> 00:31:10,478
That's a lie.

401
00:31:10,687 --> 00:31:14,524
I haven't truly confessed
in 20 years.

402
00:31:17,528 --> 00:31:19,320
Go on.

403
00:31:20,155 --> 00:31:22,198
I have forsaken...

404
00:31:24,535 --> 00:31:28,329
...what is right for what is easy.

405
00:31:32,167 --> 00:31:35,753
Allowing what I know is evil
in my house.

406
00:31:37,923 --> 00:31:39,632
Allowing my children...

407
00:31:39,842 --> 00:31:43,511
...oh, my God, my sweet children,
to be a part of it.

408
00:31:44,304 --> 00:31:46,305
Because I wanted things for them.

409
00:31:46,557 --> 00:31:49,934
Wanted a better life. Good schools.

410
00:31:50,144 --> 00:31:52,436
I wanted this house.

411
00:31:52,771 --> 00:31:57,441
I wanted money in my hands,
money to buy anything I ever wanted.

412
00:31:57,734 --> 00:31:59,402
I'm so ashamed.

413
00:32:08,287 --> 00:32:10,079
My husband...

414
00:32:11,582 --> 00:32:15,084
I think he has committed
horrible acts.

415
00:32:17,297 --> 00:32:20,591
I think he has...
You know all about him, Father Phil.

416
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,927
I've said nothing.
I've done nothing about it.

417
00:32:26,139 --> 00:32:28,682
I got a bad feeling.

418
00:32:30,518 --> 00:32:33,478
It's a matter of time
before God compensates me...

419
00:32:33,688 --> 00:32:35,772
...with outrage for my sins.

420
00:32:52,832 --> 00:32:54,750
All right, come on.

421
00:32:57,045 --> 00:32:59,755
Oh, tequila breath.

422
00:32:59,964 --> 00:33:00,964
Sorry, Dad.

423
00:33:01,257 --> 00:33:03,467
It's all right.
Just hang on to me.

424
00:33:03,968 --> 00:33:06,970
Throw up on that dress,
I'll have to tell Mom.

425
00:33:07,472 --> 00:33:10,933
This guy was giving me
tequila shooters.

426
00:33:14,479 --> 00:33:17,606
Oh, God, everything is spinning.

427
00:33:18,191 --> 00:33:20,859
- You're not mad, are you?
- A little bit.

428
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:23,320
- Where are the keys?
- I gave them to you.

429
00:33:23,488 --> 00:33:24,905
Supposed to be.

430
00:33:25,324 --> 00:33:27,825
- I love you, Dad.
- I know.

431
00:33:38,712 --> 00:33:40,797
You must truly repent.

432
00:33:41,006 --> 00:33:43,883
Genuinely and honestly.

433
00:33:45,427 --> 00:33:50,348
In the future you must renounce these
actions, and God will absolve you.

434
00:33:53,852 --> 00:33:56,354
I don't know, Father.
I'll try.

435
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:00,358
But I still love him.

436
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,028
I believe he can be a good man.

437
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,657
Then you help change him
into a better man.

438
00:34:07,866 --> 00:34:10,285
Then you will have done good
in God's eyes.

439
00:34:14,957 --> 00:34:16,499
You should take Communion.

440
00:34:18,377 --> 00:34:19,752
Yeah.

441
00:34:34,893 --> 00:34:36,144
Why do you have that?

442
00:34:36,396 --> 00:34:41,150
Unfortunately I had to say Mass
for someone in intensive care.

443
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:50,075
Lord, I am not worthy to receive Thee.

444
00:34:51,036 --> 00:34:54,913
- But just say the word...
- And I will be healed.

445
00:35:14,768 --> 00:35:19,063
This is the body of Christ.
It was broken for you.

446
00:35:31,868 --> 00:35:34,787
This is the blood of Christ.

447
00:35:35,705 --> 00:35:37,623
It was shed for you.

448
00:36:00,147 --> 00:36:03,983
Accept the spirit of Christ,
our Lord and Savior.

449
00:36:05,069 --> 00:36:06,486
Amen.

450
00:36:07,154 --> 00:36:11,324
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

451
00:36:30,803 --> 00:36:32,387
Dad?

452
00:36:33,597 --> 00:36:36,766
I booked a seat on a Boston
flight. Tomorrow, 4:00.

453
00:36:37,268 --> 00:36:39,602
- Best I could get.
- Don't come.

454
00:36:40,104 --> 00:36:42,564
I'll make sure you're gone
before it happens.

455
00:36:42,815 --> 00:36:45,191
- We won't ever meet.
- This is my thing.

456
00:36:45,693 --> 00:36:49,612
I am your soldier. This is my duty
like we're always talking about.

457
00:36:49,822 --> 00:36:51,698
The way this went down...

458
00:36:52,324 --> 00:36:55,118
...this is my call.
I'll vouch for this myself.

459
00:36:55,494 --> 00:36:58,538
Clipping a rat puts me
a cunt-hair away from being made.

460
00:36:58,789 --> 00:37:02,041
He might've recognized me
at the gas station. He could lam.

461
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:08,090
You stay put.
End of discussion.

462
00:37:10,385 --> 00:37:12,386
Why are you using the pay phone?

463
00:37:12,637 --> 00:37:14,555
These walls are like paper.

464
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:17,308
- Please don't lie to me.
- Go back to bed.

465
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:19,977
Lying down made me throw up.

466
00:37:50,425 --> 00:37:51,926
Hello.

467
00:37:52,177 --> 00:37:54,178
Oh, hi, honey.

468
00:37:55,805 --> 00:37:57,932
Oh, yeah. Was it fun?

469
00:37:59,476 --> 00:38:01,018
Oh, good.

470
00:38:05,065 --> 00:38:07,066
You want to sleep over there?

471
00:38:10,363 --> 00:38:12,948
Okay. Love you.

472
00:38:36,097 --> 00:38:37,722
That was A.J.

473
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:42,310
- He's sleeping over.
- I see.

474
00:38:45,314 --> 00:38:49,609
- At a friend's house.
- Oh.

475
00:38:52,822 --> 00:38:55,824
The Pucillos. I don't know
if you know them.

476
00:38:57,285 --> 00:38:58,577
No.

477
00:39:01,289 --> 00:39:02,330
Oh.

478
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:05,875
Oh.

479
00:39:06,168 --> 00:39:07,961
- I...
- What?

480
00:39:09,297 --> 00:39:11,006
Are you all right?

481
00:39:22,436 --> 00:39:24,145
Father Phil?

482
00:39:24,521 --> 00:39:26,230
Are you all right?

483
00:39:50,797 --> 00:39:52,089
Hello?

484
00:39:53,258 --> 00:39:54,467
Hello?

485
00:40:32,839 --> 00:40:35,257
Ow! Don't!

486
00:40:37,136 --> 00:40:38,970
You want to stop and get a beer?

487
00:40:51,192 --> 00:40:52,818
You need this thing?

488
00:41:28,187 --> 00:41:30,981
I'll pick you up in a little while.
Knock 'em dead.

489
00:41:31,524 --> 00:41:34,359
- Aren't you coming in?
- I left my watch at the motel.

490
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:36,653
I'll catch up to you later.

491
00:41:37,655 --> 00:41:39,531
Grab me a student paper.

492
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:28,956
You should have some coffee.

493
00:42:32,628 --> 00:42:35,087
- Last night...
- Yeah.

494
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,217
We didn't do anything out of line.

495
00:42:39,426 --> 00:42:41,844
There's nothing to apologize about.

496
00:42:43,806 --> 00:42:45,807
- Right.
- That's right.

497
00:42:48,977 --> 00:42:52,104
I should get dressed. Get going.

498
00:42:52,314 --> 00:42:54,398
Anthony Jr. will be home soon.

499
00:42:54,608 --> 00:42:58,653
Oh, my God. My car's been out there
all night in plain sight.

500
00:42:58,947 --> 00:43:01,323
We didn't do anything wrong.

501
00:43:01,574 --> 00:43:04,326
Is there a commandment
against eating ziti?

502
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,121
Take a shower, get dressed.

503
00:43:08,373 --> 00:43:11,583
Don't forget your
sacrament kit, whatever.

504
00:43:14,587 --> 00:43:16,588
I'm home!

505
00:43:20,593 --> 00:43:22,261
Carmela.

506
00:43:24,389 --> 00:43:26,431
I don't know where to begin.

507
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:34,773
It's not that I don't have desire
for you in my heart.

508
00:43:35,108 --> 00:43:36,483
Madonna, Father, please.

509
00:43:36,776 --> 00:43:40,612
Last night was one of the most
difficult tests from God ever.

510
00:43:40,947 --> 00:43:43,323
What are you talking about?
We're friends.

511
00:43:45,743 --> 00:43:48,287
- What's that look?
- What, I look some way?

512
00:43:54,002 --> 00:43:57,504
I was just thinking about when
we watched Casablanca last week.

513
00:43:58,381 --> 00:44:00,757
That new print is great, huh?

514
00:44:01,968 --> 00:44:06,597
"Of all the lousy gin joints in the
world, why'd you have to pick mine?"

515
00:44:08,475 --> 00:44:13,104
Of all the finocchi priests,
why did I get the one who's straight?

516
00:44:15,608 --> 00:44:17,275
Carmela.

517
00:44:17,776 --> 00:44:19,986
Come on, it's a joke.

518
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,552
I would have done it myself,
but some people came along.

519
00:44:45,012 --> 00:44:48,139
Anyway, listen.
It's a gray Town Car, new model.

520
00:44:48,724 --> 00:44:50,600
Pick him up on the Colby campus.

521
00:44:50,851 --> 00:44:52,644
Where on the Colby campus?

522
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:55,939
His kid's applying,
the fucking admissions office.

523
00:44:56,231 --> 00:44:58,399
- Oh.
- You follow him.

524
00:44:58,651 --> 00:45:01,778
Outside of town, you pull
up alongside, boom! 12-gauge.

525
00:45:02,363 --> 00:45:03,780
- Fuck that.
- Do it...

526
00:45:04,073 --> 00:45:06,699
...or you'll never
get another bag off me.

527
00:45:12,039 --> 00:45:14,874
No, no, no. Fuck that.
Fuck that!

528
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:17,752
Want the cops to know who
burnt the Historical House?

529
00:45:18,045 --> 00:45:20,713
Fuck you, fuckwad!

530
00:45:21,007 --> 00:45:24,885
We were volunteer firemen
together, asshole! I know!

531
00:45:34,729 --> 00:45:36,563
Yeah, is Dougy in?

532
00:47:31,472 --> 00:47:34,390
- Good morning, rat.
- Who are you? What is this?

533
00:47:34,683 --> 00:47:36,893
Don't make me laugh. You fuck!

534
00:47:37,186 --> 00:47:38,978
Teddy, there must be something...

535
00:47:39,271 --> 00:47:41,773
It's Tony.
Know how much trouble you're in?

536
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,485
You took an oath and you broke it.

537
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:47,363
I could have killed you
outside the motel.

538
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:49,198
Your daughter was drunk.

539
00:47:49,407 --> 00:47:50,866
I was in the parking lot.

540
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:54,495
I didn't do it because of her.
I told myself:

541
00:47:54,996 --> 00:47:57,373
"It's just a coincidence...

542
00:47:57,624 --> 00:48:00,292
- ...he's taking her to college."
- With wiseguys...

543
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,211
...the hustle never ends.

544
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:05,131
If you'd shot me, your life
would have been over.

545
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:07,049
Please. I'm begging you.

546
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,345
Jimmy says hello from hell!

547
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:46,274
Where've you been?

548
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:49,819
The motel didn't have the watch.
I went to the restaurant.

549
00:49:50,071 --> 00:49:52,572
I had to wait
for them to open.

550
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,616
The restaurant had your watch?

551
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:58,161
I took it off in the bathroom
while I washed my hands.

552
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:00,705
You ready?
You'll be late for Bowdoin.

553
00:50:15,806 --> 00:50:17,098
What's up with that?

554
00:50:20,727 --> 00:50:23,729
Oh, the restaurant.

555
00:50:23,981 --> 00:50:26,691
I tried the back door
and there were puddles.

556
00:50:30,445 --> 00:50:32,154
It was dumb, I know.

557
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:39,620
Your hand is bleeding!

558
00:50:39,871 --> 00:50:41,956
You saw that man, didn't you?

559
00:50:42,541 --> 00:50:46,043
I cut it on a screen door.
What man?

560
00:50:46,336 --> 00:50:48,421
The man you said you didn't know.

561
00:50:49,131 --> 00:50:50,715
What do you think happened?

562
00:50:50,966 --> 00:50:52,842
I don't know. A fight?

563
00:50:53,051 --> 00:50:55,428
You're making it a big deal,
and you don't know!

564
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:58,556
You were on the pay phone
again at 1 a.m!

565
00:50:58,724 --> 00:51:01,309
I was on the pay phone at 1 a.m?

566
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,269
Excuse me, Miss Cuervo Añejo.

567
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:08,065
You can't remember what happened.
You were seeing pink elephants!

568
00:51:09,026 --> 00:51:11,277
I warned you not to drink.

569
00:51:14,906 --> 00:51:18,492
Dad, you're being honest
with me, right?

570
00:51:18,745 --> 00:51:20,412
You're gonna hurt my feelings.

571
00:51:22,498 --> 00:51:24,416
We have that kind of relationship.

572
00:51:24,709 --> 00:51:29,755
That's right. We do or we don't.
It takes two to tango.

573
00:51:32,967 --> 00:51:34,301
- Dad...
- What?

574
00:51:40,641 --> 00:51:41,933
Nothing.

575
00:51:49,734 --> 00:51:50,817
I love you.

576
00:51:52,362 --> 00:51:54,029
I love you too.

577
00:52:00,536 --> 00:52:02,120
- Where's my paper?
- I forgot.

578
00:52:02,372 --> 00:52:03,413
She forgot.

579
00:52:10,421 --> 00:52:12,506
Miss Soprano. Come on in.

580
00:52:15,968 --> 00:52:18,387
Shall we talk about your future?

581
00:52:45,707 --> 00:52:47,667
He's our most famous alumnus.

582
00:53:08,397 --> 00:53:11,899
Oh, here they are.
The two Ivy Leaguers!

583
00:53:12,401 --> 00:53:13,776
How was it?
Want to eat?

584
00:53:14,027 --> 00:53:16,404
It was good. I gotta call Hunter.

585
00:53:16,572 --> 00:53:17,613
Hey.

586
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:22,410
- Gee, she spared me no boring detail.
- I'll be back!

587
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:25,163
What a trip. I'm beat.

588
00:53:25,414 --> 00:53:28,166
What, New England?
It's so gorgeous.

589
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:31,294
You still sound nasal,
but you look better.

590
00:53:32,421 --> 00:53:33,588
Any cold pasta?

591
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:36,299
There was some ziti,
but it got eaten.

592
00:53:37,843 --> 00:53:39,927
The whole tray? From last Sunday?

593
00:53:41,598 --> 00:53:43,807
Monsignor Jughead was here.

594
00:53:44,225 --> 00:53:47,978
If you are referring
to Father Intintola, yes, he was.

595
00:53:49,063 --> 00:53:52,566
- He spent the night here.
- Yeah, right.

596
00:53:53,151 --> 00:53:54,651
Okay.

597
00:53:57,739 --> 00:54:00,532
The priest spent the night here?
What happened?

598
00:54:00,742 --> 00:54:02,576
- Nothing.
- Where was Anthony?

599
00:54:03,077 --> 00:54:04,661
Sleeping over at Jason's.

600
00:54:05,288 --> 00:54:09,166
The priest spent the night here,
nothing happened.

601
00:54:09,459 --> 00:54:13,879
- You're telling me this because?
- You might hear something.

602
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:16,256
His car was out front all night.

603
00:54:16,508 --> 00:54:20,677
You know what? This is too fucked-up
for me even to think about.

604
00:54:25,683 --> 00:54:29,394
What'd you guys do for 12 hours,
play "Name That Pope"?

605
00:54:29,979 --> 00:54:34,358
- He gave me Communion.
- I'll bet he gave you Communion.

606
00:54:34,609 --> 00:54:35,609
Excuse me?

607
00:54:35,944 --> 00:54:39,738
The guy spends the night here,
and all he does is slip you a wafer?

608
00:54:40,156 --> 00:54:43,283
- That's verging on sacrilege.
- I didn't mean to verge.

609
00:54:43,535 --> 00:54:46,119
- Do you think I'm lying?
- It sounds...

610
00:54:46,329 --> 00:54:51,124
Would I have told you if we did? Do
I look like the frigging Thorn Bird?

611
00:54:53,254 --> 00:54:55,713
He's a fag. That's it.

612
00:54:56,507 --> 00:54:59,217
Otherwise, I gotta question
what I'm hearing.

613
00:55:00,302 --> 00:55:01,970
Tony, you are a sketch.

614
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:09,352
Oh, by the way,
your therapist called.

615
00:55:10,271 --> 00:55:11,646
Jennifer?

616
00:55:16,485 --> 00:55:17,694
Carm!

617
00:55:19,488 --> 00:55:23,199
I thought you'd think it was weird
if I saw a woman psychiatrist.

618
00:55:25,077 --> 00:55:29,622
Carm, come on! It's just therapy,
that's all! We just talk!


1
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:51,446
So...

2
00:01:51,864 --> 00:01:55,033
...you know, usual girl stuff.

3
00:01:55,284 --> 00:01:57,827
She picks up the dry-cleaning
and shops.

4
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:03,124
Dr. Melfi has excellent taste, she
only shops at the fancy-schmancy deli.

5
00:02:03,501 --> 00:02:07,296
The kind with the Italian name
but they don't have meatballs.

6
00:02:07,631 --> 00:02:09,006
All right, what else?

7
00:02:09,257 --> 00:02:13,260
What am I supposed to be looking for?
What's up with this cooz?

8
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,512
It's none of your fucking business.

9
00:02:15,806 --> 00:02:18,475
You're on a strict need-to-know,
lieutenant.

10
00:02:19,143 --> 00:02:21,811
I should knock you out for
what you did to her date.

11
00:02:22,104 --> 00:02:27,234
What? I scared your goomar's date
a little. What's the big deal?

12
00:02:30,655 --> 00:02:32,822
- This guy still come around?
- No.

13
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:37,245
He's not her type. He's a coward.
He nearly pissed himself.

14
00:02:37,496 --> 00:02:40,331
Anything else?
I don't want to be here all day.

15
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:43,834
Yesterday she got off
at 9 and she went to bed early.

16
00:02:44,836 --> 00:02:45,836
That's it?

17
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:47,463
That's it.

18
00:02:49,717 --> 00:02:52,678
Here, buy yourself an iron.

19
00:03:00,103 --> 00:03:01,186
Ready?

20
00:03:03,899 --> 00:03:05,024
Decaf, right?

21
00:03:12,032 --> 00:03:14,826
So how was your college trip
with your daughter?

22
00:03:15,494 --> 00:03:19,998
I tell you, my life is like an
episode of Provolone-something.

23
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,542
What's going on?

24
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,044
My wife. All we do is fight.

25
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:27,214
And she's jealous of you.

26
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:32,052
Is that something that you feel or
has it been discussed with Carmela?

27
00:03:32,595 --> 00:03:34,722
She didn't know you were a girl.

28
00:03:35,725 --> 00:03:39,853
You know, a woman.
Excuse me, a doctor.

29
00:03:40,062 --> 00:03:41,646
Woman doctor.

30
00:03:41,856 --> 00:03:44,858
- Why did you take so long to tell her?
- I didn't.

31
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:47,444
You spilled the beans
when you called.

32
00:03:47,653 --> 00:03:52,365
Let me ask you a different question.
Why a female? Why a female doctor?

33
00:03:52,576 --> 00:03:57,246
She asked the same frigging question,
and I sometimes wonder myself.

34
00:03:57,456 --> 00:04:00,166
- And?
- I'll tell you what I told her.

35
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:05,212
It was between two Jewish guys and
a paisan. So I picked the paisan.

36
00:04:05,422 --> 00:04:10,593
What's the one thing your mother,
wife and daughter have in common?

37
00:04:10,845 --> 00:04:12,429
They all break my balls.

38
00:04:15,016 --> 00:04:17,642
I know what you mean.
They're all Italian, so what?

39
00:04:17,935 --> 00:04:22,314
So maybe by coming clean with me,
you're dialoguing with them.

40
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,483
Let me ask you a question.

41
00:04:25,944 --> 00:04:27,820
Why do you have me as a patient?

42
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:33,284
Most legit people I know
wouldn't make eye contact with me.

43
00:04:33,535 --> 00:04:34,952
But you...

44
00:04:35,245 --> 00:04:37,038
...you didn't flinch.

45
00:04:50,637 --> 00:04:54,723
- Water's warm, come on in.
- Hey, Sammy. How are you?

46
00:04:56,685 --> 00:04:59,562
- I was just gonna make some coffee.
- Yeah?

47
00:04:59,772 --> 00:05:00,814
How's Junior?

48
00:05:03,317 --> 00:05:05,985
Sit the fuck down! Down!

49
00:05:08,614 --> 00:05:10,990
That's how Junior is, Sammy.

50
00:05:11,158 --> 00:05:13,368
I'm with little Jimmy Altieri.

51
00:05:13,578 --> 00:05:17,415
Yeah, you paying Jimmy for this game?
Huh, Sammy?

52
00:05:17,624 --> 00:05:18,624
No.

53
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,836
Are you paying someone for this game?

54
00:05:26,007 --> 00:05:27,842
Now the party's over.

55
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:32,139
Junior Soprano is the new boss...

56
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,808
...and he ain't respecting
old arrangements.

57
00:05:35,143 --> 00:05:36,518
Hey, you're lucky.

58
00:05:36,727 --> 00:05:40,355
You stayed slender. You could
buy it right off the rack.

59
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,691
I want something special.

60
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:45,861
The boys are having
a little time for me.

61
00:05:46,155 --> 00:05:48,448
You're wearing the suit
to the dinner, eh?

62
00:05:49,032 --> 00:05:52,410
These guys today want to be buried
in a jogging outfit.

63
00:05:54,455 --> 00:05:58,249
So how's your...
What's your oldest boy's name?

64
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:02,211
- Rafael. "Ralphie."
- Yeah.

65
00:06:02,755 --> 00:06:03,881
- Good kid.
- Yeah.

66
00:06:04,174 --> 00:06:06,383
He lost his son, you know.

67
00:06:06,593 --> 00:06:08,010
What do you mean, "lost"?

68
00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:09,219
Dead.

69
00:06:09,387 --> 00:06:10,721
Morto.

70
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:17,603
Just a fucking kid! A baby!

71
00:06:19,732 --> 00:06:22,901
What are we talking about here?
You lost your grandson?

72
00:06:23,194 --> 00:06:26,404
What are you gonna do with
these fucking animals...

73
00:06:26,614 --> 00:06:29,240
...these drug dealers?

74
00:06:29,408 --> 00:06:31,493
He used to run around breaking balls.

75
00:06:32,411 --> 00:06:33,870
Dominic.

76
00:06:34,122 --> 00:06:35,789
My namesake.

77
00:06:37,042 --> 00:06:38,876
Did you know about this?

78
00:06:39,794 --> 00:06:44,256
What'd I say about this poison?
These kids shouldn't touch it!

79
00:06:45,634 --> 00:06:49,720
I read the paper every day about
these poor pricks overdosing.

80
00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:52,557
He didn't overdose, he killed himself.

81
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:54,643
Fourteen years old.

82
00:06:54,894 --> 00:06:58,271
- Jesus!
- Was this at Patterson Falls?

83
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:01,566
Holy shit, that was your grandson?

84
00:07:01,776 --> 00:07:05,111
- What?
- He took a designer drug.

85
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,156
Goes to the Falls, takes a header
right off the fence.

86
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:13,496
They said the current bashed his head
on rocks for days before he came up.

87
00:07:15,582 --> 00:07:19,043
And meanwhile, this piece of shit...

88
00:07:19,253 --> 00:07:24,298
...he gets to walk the streets and
sell more of this stuff to young kids.

89
00:07:24,592 --> 00:07:26,176
Oh, really?

90
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:29,471
What's this motherless fuck's name?

91
00:07:34,227 --> 00:07:37,521
- Even the coffee's old in here.
- How much can you complain?

92
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:40,024
Eventually, you've got a broken hip.

93
00:07:40,401 --> 00:07:44,404
I want to give you a macchinetta.
It's the only way to get good coffee.

94
00:07:44,613 --> 00:07:46,406
What are you wearing?

95
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,658
You smell like a French putain.

96
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:51,035
It's Canoe. Johnny wore Canoe.

97
00:07:52,788 --> 00:07:53,788
Morning, Livia.

98
00:07:53,957 --> 00:07:56,250
- Oh, good morning.
- Morning.

99
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:57,835
- Yeah, hi.
- New arrival?

100
00:07:58,044 --> 00:07:59,920
Go ahead, keep moving, fella.

101
00:08:04,843 --> 00:08:06,594
I'm happy for you, Junior.

102
00:08:07,178 --> 00:08:10,514
I know how long you waited
to be made boss.

103
00:08:10,766 --> 00:08:14,019
Just don't let certain people
take advantage of you...

104
00:08:14,186 --> 00:08:15,687
...like they did to Johnny.

105
00:08:15,855 --> 00:08:18,648
What certain people?
Nobody got over on Johnny.

106
00:08:18,858 --> 00:08:21,026
Nobody's gonna get over on me.

107
00:08:23,112 --> 00:08:24,821
How's your Jewish friend?

108
00:08:25,197 --> 00:08:26,364
Hesh? What about him?

109
00:08:26,575 --> 00:08:30,578
- Whoever heard of a Jew riding horses?
- He owns a horse farm.

110
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:33,873
He's Tony's friend, not mine.

111
00:08:35,042 --> 00:08:38,669
- What have you got against him?
- Who, me? Nothing.

112
00:08:39,212 --> 00:08:40,796
Johnny liked him.

113
00:08:41,048 --> 00:08:46,218
And my son thinks every word that
comes out of his mouth is pure gold.

114
00:08:47,597 --> 00:08:52,059
Are you telling me that since
I'm the new boss, I should tax Hesh?

115
00:08:56,397 --> 00:09:00,484
Boy, Anthony must've really gotten
under your collar. Admit it.

116
00:09:00,736 --> 00:09:03,696
You want to crack his coglioni
for putting you in here.

117
00:09:04,073 --> 00:09:07,283
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah.

118
00:09:08,285 --> 00:09:10,578
And I'm playing shortstop
for the Mets.

119
00:09:12,247 --> 00:09:14,415
All right, watch the balls!

120
00:09:27,097 --> 00:09:28,847
What is the matter?

121
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,892
Tony's cannoli doesn't
want to stand up?

122
00:09:32,103 --> 00:09:34,688
Tony's cannoli's tired.

123
00:09:34,939 --> 00:09:37,232
But I can make it happen, baby.

124
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:38,858
I know.

125
00:09:39,235 --> 00:09:41,111
Just, maybe...

126
00:09:44,615 --> 00:09:45,990
So how's your job?

127
00:09:46,242 --> 00:09:47,450
What?

128
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:49,328
Since when do you care?

129
00:09:49,705 --> 00:09:51,622
Can't I be nice?

130
00:09:52,624 --> 00:09:53,624
All right...

131
00:09:54,918 --> 00:09:56,085
...forget it.

132
00:09:58,922 --> 00:10:01,257
You don't want to talk? Fine.

133
00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:04,635
Here, go with somebody
who gives a fuck.

134
00:10:04,887 --> 00:10:06,471
I'm not a fucking whore!

135
00:10:06,764 --> 00:10:09,099
Stick your money up your ass!

136
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:13,562
- I don't know what's wrong...
- There's nothing wrong with me!

137
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,814
Just wanted to talk, that's all!

138
00:10:16,065 --> 00:10:19,025
Talking with you,
I might as well be a fucking dildo!

139
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,989
If you were a dildo,
we wouldn't be fighting.

140
00:10:23,157 --> 00:10:25,491
What does that mean,
you fucking refugee?

141
00:10:25,743 --> 00:10:27,326
What does that mean?

142
00:10:29,163 --> 00:10:30,163
Come here.

143
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:34,751
Want to fight me? Knock you out!
You fucking communist cunt!

144
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,502
Hey, hey, hey!

145
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,467
Yeah, same to you!

146
00:10:43,511 --> 00:10:45,596
You fucking burned me!

147
00:10:47,974 --> 00:10:49,349
How you doing?

148
00:10:51,937 --> 00:10:53,688
What do you got, Andrea?

149
00:11:02,448 --> 00:11:04,115
- Clabby?
- Hearts.

150
00:11:04,408 --> 00:11:06,284
Jump in, the water's warm.

151
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:09,496
Child's play. Pound a point.

152
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,629
- Hesh is outside.
- Tell him to come in.

153
00:11:18,131 --> 00:11:20,090
He says he needs a word with you.

154
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,677
What the fuck?
You eat more queens than Lancelot.

155
00:11:30,186 --> 00:11:31,645
What's up?

156
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,272
- Let's walk.
- That serious?

157
00:11:36,275 --> 00:11:39,945
- You spoke to your uncle lately?
- Junior?

158
00:11:40,155 --> 00:11:41,447
Yeah.

159
00:11:41,865 --> 00:11:44,909
No. I don't know. Why, what's up?

160
00:11:45,118 --> 00:11:48,913
- Your father was a fair man.
- What's that got to do with Junior?

161
00:11:49,122 --> 00:11:50,790
Junior's not so fair.

162
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:54,752
Sometimes I wish you'd just get
to the point. What'd he do?

163
00:11:54,962 --> 00:11:56,879
He's taxing me, Tony.

164
00:11:58,091 --> 00:12:00,259
He's taxing you?
When did this happen?

165
00:12:00,426 --> 00:12:01,426
Today.

166
00:12:01,594 --> 00:12:03,887
Did you tell him you
operate without tax?

167
00:12:04,097 --> 00:12:06,598
That my father loved you
and respected you?

168
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,102
That 10 cents of every dollar
in his kick is from you?

169
00:12:12,146 --> 00:12:16,149
My uncle's boss of the family
10 minutes, already I got agita!

170
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,112
What'd you say?

171
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:22,699
It's a reasonable request
but an unreasonable figure.

172
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,076
What do you mean,
reasonable request?

173
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,953
He's the boss now, Tony.

174
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,707
He calls the tune, we dance to it.
That's the way it's done.

175
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:34,461
You can either respect that
or change the rules.

176
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:38,757
Tony, I came over here to tell you
with all this bullshit going on...

177
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,509
...I can't stay in this area.

178
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,219
Where you gonna go?

179
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,055
Come on.
I consider my royalty checks.

180
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:47,017
I wrote six gold records.

181
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:49,019
No, a couple of black kids did.

182
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,689
You just gave yourself a cowriting
credit. Come on, Heshie.

183
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:57,110
I know you. You leave this,
you're gonna kill yourself.

184
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:01,448
How much does he want?

185
00:13:01,658 --> 00:13:05,036
500 large. Plus, two points
monthly on my shy.

186
00:13:08,624 --> 00:13:09,790
All right.

187
00:13:11,293 --> 00:13:15,004
Do me a favor, sit tight for now.
Let me think about it for a while.

188
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,694
How was that, baby?

189
00:14:17,071 --> 00:14:18,113
The best.

190
00:14:19,281 --> 00:14:21,074
You are the best.

191
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:24,245
Come here.

192
00:14:27,207 --> 00:14:29,250
Tony, I love your cannoli.

193
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:32,753
You okay?

194
00:14:34,256 --> 00:14:35,923
Yeah, I'm okay.

195
00:14:36,425 --> 00:14:37,758
Go back to sleep.

196
00:14:42,473 --> 00:14:44,266
Sure you're all right?

197
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,693
So, what do you want New York to do?

198
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:57,113
Junior can't know that we talked.

199
00:14:57,364 --> 00:15:00,700
He's gotta think that Hesh came
to you on his own, by himself.

200
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:04,871
You are still running things.

201
00:15:05,956 --> 00:15:09,625
The arrangement, whatever it is,
can't be insulting to my uncle.

202
00:15:09,918 --> 00:15:11,961
Hesh has got to pay something.

203
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,256
I just haven't decided what.

204
00:15:20,972 --> 00:15:23,599
I gotta get back. We'll talk later.

205
00:15:29,523 --> 00:15:30,940
How's the veal?

206
00:15:31,317 --> 00:15:32,776
It's like rubber.

207
00:15:33,486 --> 00:15:34,652
Yeah?

208
00:15:39,325 --> 00:15:40,784
Tastes all right to me.

209
00:15:41,619 --> 00:15:43,203
Want something else?

210
00:15:59,931 --> 00:16:01,223
Don't look at me.

211
00:16:01,516 --> 00:16:03,767
Compliments of Johnny Sack.

212
00:16:09,524 --> 00:16:12,275
Why don't you spend the rest
of our anniversary with him?

213
00:16:13,069 --> 00:16:15,904
I was over there for 10
frigging minutes, Carmela.

214
00:16:16,573 --> 00:16:18,783
- Don't do this.
- All right, Tony.

215
00:16:19,034 --> 00:16:20,910
At least I know where I stand.

216
00:16:24,456 --> 00:16:26,541
Why do you always gotta
be so dramatic?

217
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:28,793
Oh, here we go.

218
00:16:30,045 --> 00:16:32,880
All right, I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.

219
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:35,759
You don't even know what
you're apologizing for.

220
00:16:36,803 --> 00:16:38,679
It's our anniversary, Tony.

221
00:16:38,888 --> 00:16:41,849
Ours. Not yours, mine and
Johnny-fucking-Sack's.

222
00:16:42,016 --> 00:16:43,684
Ours.

223
00:16:44,018 --> 00:16:47,688
I thought we could get a room
at the Plaza like last year or...

224
00:16:47,898 --> 00:16:49,732
I don't know. I don't...

225
00:16:58,909 --> 00:17:00,743
I'm sorry, Carmela.

226
00:17:03,665 --> 00:17:07,376
I just got a lot on my mind
and I'm not thinking straight.

227
00:17:10,172 --> 00:17:11,338
Hey...

228
00:17:12,757 --> 00:17:14,049
...I'm sorry.

229
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:19,889
Should I call the Plaza?

230
00:17:20,766 --> 00:17:21,766
Come on.

231
00:17:23,394 --> 00:17:25,103
No, let's go home.

232
00:17:37,075 --> 00:17:38,659
Hey, come here.

233
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,996
Carm, what do you want me to say?

234
00:17:42,206 --> 00:17:43,998
Tell me. I'm lost at sea here!

235
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:47,877
You've changed, Tony.
And I resent it.

236
00:17:48,545 --> 00:17:52,423
It's destroying what little
self-esteem I have left.

237
00:17:52,717 --> 00:17:54,509
Sometimes I think you skeeve me.

238
00:17:54,802 --> 00:17:56,386
I skeeve you?

239
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:59,139
You're the mother of my children.
How could I?

240
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,516
You see what I'm talking about?
There.

241
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:06,939
"You're the mother of my children."
I'm just someone you procreated with.

242
00:18:08,442 --> 00:18:10,109
You know it could be the Prozac.

243
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:14,322
Ginny Torrelli's been on it for years,
and she'd hump a fire hydrant.

244
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,991
Dr. Melfi said it had
different side effects.

245
00:18:17,243 --> 00:18:19,786
Oh. She told you that?

246
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:38,138
Before we start today's session...

247
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,683
...we need to address the coffee.

248
00:18:42,395 --> 00:18:45,021
It's not appropriate
of me to take gifts.

249
00:18:45,273 --> 00:18:48,149
- It's a cup of coffee.
- Let's just make a rule, okay?

250
00:18:48,401 --> 00:18:49,943
No gifts.

251
00:18:53,155 --> 00:18:54,864
- Does this mean I can't drink mine?
- No.

252
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,242
Oh, I'm sorry.

253
00:18:57,411 --> 00:19:02,498
I usually have my answering service on,
but I have a car emergency.

254
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,125
Yes?

255
00:19:06,253 --> 00:19:08,254
What does that mean, "diagnostic"?

256
00:19:09,423 --> 00:19:12,091
I just want to know what's
wrong with my car.

257
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,387
No. No, don't do anything.

258
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:18,348
No, I want to get a second opinion.

259
00:19:20,268 --> 00:19:23,729
I'll take my chances. Thank you.

260
00:19:25,315 --> 00:19:27,524
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

261
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:30,236
It's all right.

262
00:19:30,696 --> 00:19:33,323
So how's it going?

263
00:19:33,532 --> 00:19:34,574
Good.

264
00:19:35,117 --> 00:19:36,284
Real good.

265
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:40,663
I think I may flush the medication,
you know?

266
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:43,124
See if the changes I'm feeling
are for real.

267
00:19:43,459 --> 00:19:46,461
Why would you do that?
The Prozac seems to be working.

268
00:19:46,671 --> 00:19:47,963
That might be the problem.

269
00:19:48,256 --> 00:19:52,343
- It might be working overtime.
- What do you mean?

270
00:19:56,264 --> 00:19:58,766
- I'm having a...
- Reaction?

271
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,353
You know, a side effect
from the stuff.

272
00:20:02,813 --> 00:20:04,481
We talked about that.

273
00:20:05,024 --> 00:20:07,359
Some people get insomnia.

274
00:20:07,568 --> 00:20:10,945
Others, a stomachache or headaches.

275
00:20:11,113 --> 00:20:12,489
But it usually passes.

276
00:20:12,698 --> 00:20:15,950
But are there any other side effects
that you know of?

277
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,829
Some people experience
a diminished libido.

278
00:20:20,207 --> 00:20:23,167
They have a hard time getting
or maintaining...

279
00:20:23,418 --> 00:20:25,961
- Bingo!
- I see.

280
00:20:26,171 --> 00:20:30,174
You know, not all impotence
is a result of the medication.

281
00:20:30,801 --> 00:20:34,637
- There's something wrong with me?
- Have you had a prostate exam?

282
00:20:34,972 --> 00:20:37,641
I don't even let anybody
wag their finger in my face.

283
00:20:40,353 --> 00:20:43,146
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have laughed.

284
00:20:43,606 --> 00:20:44,731
Don't apologize.

285
00:20:45,358 --> 00:20:47,442
- Oh, boy.
- You got a nice laugh.

286
00:20:47,652 --> 00:20:51,655
- All right, let's be serious.
- Hey. I'm serious.

287
00:20:53,784 --> 00:20:58,162
You know that depression is also
a leading factor in impotence.

288
00:20:58,997 --> 00:21:03,668
In the morning or at night
do you ever have an erection?

289
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,628
You could set your clock to it.

290
00:21:06,172 --> 00:21:09,133
Okay, so we know it's not
a physical problem.

291
00:21:16,933 --> 00:21:19,977
- Put that in after the credenza.
- Yes, ma'am.

292
00:21:22,565 --> 00:21:23,940
What's going on?

293
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,025
Yeah, I bought some furniture.

294
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:29,404
Let's just move into Roche Bobois,
save the delivery charge.

295
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:30,864
Fine, I'll send it back.

296
00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:33,950
No. But you've been spending
like a drunken sailor.

297
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,743
I said I'll send it back.

298
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:38,538
Mother of Christ,
I didn't say that, did I?

299
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,624
Jesus!

300
00:21:43,545 --> 00:21:46,672
You shouldn't be telling my uncle
how to run things.

301
00:21:46,882 --> 00:21:51,552
You think I got the balls to tell
your uncle how he should run things?

302
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,431
I shouldn't expect to see
the Statue of Liberty again if I did.

303
00:21:58,603 --> 00:22:00,270
All right, look, Tony...

304
00:22:00,563 --> 00:22:04,566
...Hesh isn't only a friend of
you guys, he's a friend of ours.

305
00:22:04,775 --> 00:22:07,277
Somebody has to step in
so he doesn't get fucked.

306
00:22:07,487 --> 00:22:09,321
I never said, "fucked."

307
00:22:09,572 --> 00:22:14,242
You should've come to me first,
airing your dirty laundry in public.

308
00:22:14,578 --> 00:22:17,955
How would it look if I went
to you after I spoke to him?

309
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:19,790
Now he's got a point.

310
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:21,751
Bottom line is...

311
00:22:23,128 --> 00:22:24,587
...what are we gonna do?

312
00:22:29,886 --> 00:22:31,970
You have a suggestion?

313
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:36,225
If there are any flies on you,
they're paying fucking rent.

314
00:22:39,604 --> 00:22:42,773
500's a little steep
for back taxes, no?

315
00:22:43,651 --> 00:22:48,363
The 2 percent of his action,
that's up to you. It affects Tony...

316
00:22:48,656 --> 00:22:50,240
...as much as Hesh.

317
00:22:51,283 --> 00:22:53,201
I'm not out to hurt anyone.

318
00:22:53,661 --> 00:22:56,287
God forbid I get in the way
of someone earning.

319
00:22:57,498 --> 00:23:00,750
One and a half on the shy business
and 300 on the back tax.

320
00:23:00,961 --> 00:23:01,961
250.

321
00:23:08,134 --> 00:23:11,303
Hold on to your cock when you
negotiate with these desert people.

322
00:23:14,641 --> 00:23:15,641
250.

323
00:23:17,228 --> 00:23:18,478
All right.

324
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,338
Mr. Soprano.

325
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,558
You want sex?

326
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:56,268
No.

327
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,813
Go back to sleep.

328
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:16,039
You know, you have a nice body.
You should make it work for you more.

329
00:24:16,332 --> 00:24:17,665
Oh, really?

330
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,959
Yeah, you reveal too much.

331
00:24:20,211 --> 00:24:22,463
You don't want other men
looking at me?

332
00:24:22,756 --> 00:24:25,382
No, when you're not with me,
you do what you want.

333
00:24:25,675 --> 00:24:30,429
But I'm saying maybe you could
wear a nice businesslike outfit.

334
00:24:30,639 --> 00:24:32,473
I think I could get into that.

335
00:24:32,766 --> 00:24:34,850
- You want me to dress like a man?
- No.

336
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,811
I don't want you to dress like a man.

337
00:24:38,064 --> 00:24:41,900
I'm just saying maybe wear something
a little more professional.

338
00:24:42,151 --> 00:24:43,485
Like you're in business.

339
00:24:43,736 --> 00:24:46,905
- Well, fuck you, Tony. I'm no whore.
- No.

340
00:24:47,156 --> 00:24:50,825
That's not what I mean, not like
you're in the whore business...

341
00:24:51,369 --> 00:24:52,369
Oh, forget it.

342
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:57,375
Come here.

343
00:25:01,421 --> 00:25:04,090
Is everyone in my life
bananas or what?

344
00:25:06,426 --> 00:25:07,426
Get over here!

345
00:25:10,348 --> 00:25:12,265
- Come...
- Go jerk off!

346
00:25:13,142 --> 00:25:15,644
Yeah. Go jerk off.

347
00:25:15,853 --> 00:25:18,230
Look at this. She burned me.

348
00:25:18,439 --> 00:25:20,148
That's not good.

349
00:25:21,442 --> 00:25:22,818
What led up to that?

350
00:25:23,027 --> 00:25:24,861
Carmela can be pretty violent.

351
00:25:27,032 --> 00:25:29,784
This added problem
that I've been having...

352
00:25:30,577 --> 00:25:33,871
...I just thought we needed
to spice things up a little bit.

353
00:25:34,081 --> 00:25:39,252
If it's not the Prozac, then maybe
I just need a little jump-start.

354
00:25:40,087 --> 00:25:42,797
I suggested that maybe she dress
a little different.

355
00:25:43,007 --> 00:25:45,467
- Something titillating?
- Yeah.

356
00:25:45,969 --> 00:25:47,177
Maybe it'd help.

357
00:25:48,096 --> 00:25:50,264
So I suggested to her...

358
00:25:50,473 --> 00:25:51,807
...not demanded...

359
00:25:52,016 --> 00:25:53,851
...suggested...

360
00:25:54,644 --> 00:25:57,187
...you know, maybe dress
a little sexier.

361
00:25:58,107 --> 00:26:02,402
- But Carmela can be very sensitive.
- Maybe she felt it degraded her.

362
00:26:02,611 --> 00:26:05,155
Not all women are into sexy lingerie.

363
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:07,449
It's not about dressing like that.

364
00:26:07,742 --> 00:26:09,367
Then what are we talking about?

365
00:26:09,577 --> 00:26:13,580
Some women are sexier when
they dress simple.

366
00:26:13,832 --> 00:26:15,916
You know, understated.

367
00:26:17,127 --> 00:26:18,836
And I don't mean...

368
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,842
Fuck it, I don't know what I mean.

369
00:26:29,432 --> 00:26:30,724
Like you.

370
00:26:31,225 --> 00:26:32,934
How like me?

371
00:26:33,144 --> 00:26:34,644
You play it down.

372
00:26:37,815 --> 00:26:41,777
Now, it's obvious you got
a killer body under there.

373
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:43,069
Don't get me wrong.

374
00:26:43,613 --> 00:26:47,199
- All right.
- Not only do you play it down...

375
00:26:50,287 --> 00:26:51,621
...but you're gentle.

376
00:26:52,623 --> 00:26:54,248
Not loud.

377
00:26:54,792 --> 00:26:56,584
Sweet-sounding.

378
00:26:58,212 --> 00:26:59,879
Like a mandolin.

379
00:27:06,638 --> 00:27:07,721
Anthony.

380
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,190
Unfortunately,
we have to stop now.

381
00:27:18,818 --> 00:27:21,402
I think it's important
that we talk about this.

382
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:24,739
Do you think you could come back
later this afternoon?

383
00:27:25,991 --> 00:27:27,075
No.

384
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,747
Till Tuesday.

385
00:27:34,209 --> 00:27:35,417
Okay?

386
00:27:41,258 --> 00:27:42,550
Yeah, all right.

387
00:27:43,969 --> 00:27:45,427
See you Tuesday.

388
00:28:51,957 --> 00:28:55,293
It's the oddest thing.
I've had this problem for weeks.

389
00:28:55,545 --> 00:28:59,006
But this morning, I get in
and it starts right up.

390
00:28:59,215 --> 00:29:00,925
And then again at the deli.

391
00:29:01,134 --> 00:29:02,676
Looks fine.

392
00:29:02,886 --> 00:29:05,971
Are you sure?
I was told I need a new starter.

393
00:29:07,933 --> 00:29:08,933
Lady...

394
00:29:09,434 --> 00:29:14,438
...as much as I might wish to rob you,
I won't try to replace a new starter.

395
00:29:14,649 --> 00:29:16,524
- What do you mean, "new"?
- New.

396
00:29:16,734 --> 00:29:19,444
It has everything but
the price tag hanging from it.

397
00:29:26,745 --> 00:29:27,954
I didn't do nothing!

398
00:29:28,205 --> 00:29:31,040
Poor kid committed suicide
up here because of you.

399
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:33,250
- You fucking know me!
- I know you.

400
00:29:35,754 --> 00:29:39,715
Listen, big boy. Listen to me,
I'm gonna give you a break.

401
00:29:39,967 --> 00:29:43,135
I'm gonna give you a break.
When I toss you over...

402
00:29:43,763 --> 00:29:48,141
...when I toss you over, if you fly,
I won't shoot you down. Deal?

403
00:29:48,393 --> 00:29:49,559
No!

404
00:29:49,769 --> 00:29:51,061
No!

405
00:30:15,588 --> 00:30:16,797
Well, my goodness.

406
00:30:18,591 --> 00:30:20,259
What happened here?

407
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,805
Some sad shit.

408
00:30:25,098 --> 00:30:27,766
Motherfucker said he didn't
want to live no more.

409
00:30:28,768 --> 00:30:29,810
Jumped.

410
00:30:37,611 --> 00:30:38,820
How much you give him?

411
00:30:52,544 --> 00:30:55,671
I thought I was the only one Junior
could make look like that.

412
00:31:00,052 --> 00:31:01,469
All right, let me hear it.

413
00:31:03,138 --> 00:31:04,805
Rusty Irish.

414
00:31:05,433 --> 00:31:06,600
What about him?

415
00:31:06,851 --> 00:31:08,185
Took a header off the Falls.

416
00:31:08,436 --> 00:31:11,104
It's the closest that junkie
ever got to a bath.

417
00:31:11,397 --> 00:31:14,441
I got news for you. That
junkie was my biggest earner.

418
00:31:14,692 --> 00:31:19,154
He moved more cards than 10 guys
put together. And another thing:

419
00:31:19,447 --> 00:31:22,908
He should've checked with me
before he did a favor for Capri.

420
00:31:24,828 --> 00:31:25,828
You're losing me.

421
00:31:25,996 --> 00:31:28,331
Irish sold Capri's grandson that shit.

422
00:31:28,582 --> 00:31:33,002
- You created a Frankenstein in Junior.
- I created?

423
00:31:34,004 --> 00:31:36,130
We agreed to let Junior have his day.

424
00:31:36,424 --> 00:31:40,302
"Let him be the lightning rod,
and when somebody goes down...

425
00:31:40,595 --> 00:31:43,430
...he's not a young man with a family."
We agreed.

426
00:31:43,848 --> 00:31:46,475
We agreed, but who expected
to get raped?

427
00:31:46,684 --> 00:31:50,854
When Jackie was boss, it all
evened out at the end of the day.

428
00:31:51,022 --> 00:31:53,690
But your uncle, Madonna,
does he eat alone!

429
00:31:53,859 --> 00:31:56,027
He doesn't even pass the salt.

430
00:31:57,029 --> 00:32:01,699
What about Sammy Grigio's card game?
Mikey beat him up. That ain't right.

431
00:32:01,867 --> 00:32:04,452
Even a broken clock is right
twice a day.

432
00:32:04,745 --> 00:32:08,206
Junior had a position.
That game wasn't paying anybody.

433
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:12,586
The minute Sammy Grigio used Jimmy's
name, it should've been end of story.

434
00:32:12,838 --> 00:32:14,380
That's right.

435
00:32:17,175 --> 00:32:20,511
- What do you want me to do?
- We made our bed, we sleep in it.

436
00:32:20,804 --> 00:32:23,597
How long will we kick upstairs
without it hurting?

437
00:32:23,807 --> 00:32:26,642
Something, anything should
trickle down over here, no?

438
00:32:27,395 --> 00:32:30,397
All we want you to do is talk to him.

439
00:32:30,606 --> 00:32:33,108
After all, he's your uncle. Come on.

440
00:32:33,276 --> 00:32:34,734
That's right.

441
00:32:48,208 --> 00:32:50,501
- Who is it?
- It's me, Ma.

442
00:32:50,752 --> 00:32:53,421
- Who?
- Anthony.

443
00:32:54,256 --> 00:32:55,756
Open the door.

444
00:33:01,181 --> 00:33:05,309
I thought it was the Activities lady.
She's a real pain in the ass.

445
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,186
Playing bingo, Livia?

446
00:33:07,437 --> 00:33:09,438
Oh, not tonight, honey.

447
00:33:09,647 --> 00:33:12,065
You know, she's a degenerate gambler.

448
00:33:12,317 --> 00:33:14,651
Milly. Milly?

449
00:33:15,237 --> 00:33:16,779
My son.

450
00:33:17,781 --> 00:33:19,240
Handsome.

451
00:33:29,336 --> 00:33:30,961
So how's it going?

452
00:33:31,129 --> 00:33:33,422
Oh, what can I say?

453
00:33:33,673 --> 00:33:35,216
Hey, this is great!

454
00:33:35,467 --> 00:33:39,053
You only need that broken reading lamp
you had by the phone at home.

455
00:33:39,262 --> 00:33:40,679
And I got it downstairs.
I can bring it.

456
00:33:42,015 --> 00:33:43,015
Listen!

457
00:33:43,183 --> 00:33:45,476
Oh, she's driving me crazy!

458
00:33:46,479 --> 00:33:48,063
- Who?
- Next door!

459
00:33:48,314 --> 00:33:49,689
There it is again.

460
00:33:52,652 --> 00:33:55,987
That's enough water!
How much water does she need?

461
00:33:56,239 --> 00:34:00,909
She runs the water all day.
Water, water, water!

462
00:34:01,118 --> 00:34:03,995
I'm living next door to Gunga Din!

463
00:34:04,748 --> 00:34:07,166
I went to Ferrara's.
I got you biscotti.

464
00:34:07,417 --> 00:34:08,584
- Almonds?
- Yeah.

465
00:34:08,835 --> 00:34:10,962
All right. Leave them there.

466
00:34:11,171 --> 00:34:14,423
I'll take them downstairs
later for my coffee.

467
00:34:19,764 --> 00:34:21,139
Uncle Jun been by?

468
00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:26,395
Oh, once in a while.
It makes him uncomfortable here.

469
00:34:26,729 --> 00:34:31,024
He's got a lot on his mind. More
responsibilities means more headaches.

470
00:34:31,526 --> 00:34:33,652
Better men than him had to work hard.

471
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:34,821
Yeah?

472
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:36,864
He'll be all right.

473
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:39,826
If he remembers who his friends are.

474
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:45,707
I'd hate to see him mess up.
He's been waiting a long time.

475
00:34:45,874 --> 00:34:47,083
What do you mean?

476
00:34:47,584 --> 00:34:50,878
It's not a business that
forgives bad decisions.

477
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,091
And I hate to see him making
wrong moves, you know.

478
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:58,971
- Especially at the beginning.
- Why you telling me? Tell him.

479
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:01,015
Ma, you got his ear.

480
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,309
He listens to you.

481
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,853
I don't know that world.

482
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:07,814
No, of course not.

483
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:11,735
But if anything, you know,
were to come up, that's all.

484
00:35:11,986 --> 00:35:13,778
I don't want to get involved.

485
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:17,449
If you have something to say to
your uncle, bring it up to him.

486
00:35:19,994 --> 00:35:24,164
- Oh, I wish the Lord would take me.
- Come on, Ma.

487
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:28,544
There's plenty of nice gents
that want a date with you.

488
00:35:28,754 --> 00:35:30,546
Look. I'm going downstairs.

489
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:35,551
I'm going downstairs before that
che brutta Activities lady finds me.

490
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:37,470
You want coffee?

491
00:35:38,013 --> 00:35:40,222
- Yeah, all right.
- Bring the cookies!

492
00:35:41,351 --> 00:35:45,437
Carmela, I don't want to sound
like religion is a cure-all...

493
00:35:46,105 --> 00:35:48,815
...but if Tony got more
involved with the Church...

494
00:35:49,067 --> 00:35:52,277
...it may help to expedite things
in his therapy.

495
00:35:53,029 --> 00:35:56,073
What's killing me is that
this is a self-inflicted wound.

496
00:35:56,283 --> 00:35:57,909
I pushed for it.

497
00:35:58,285 --> 00:36:01,621
I could deal with the goomars.
I knew I was better than them.

498
00:36:02,539 --> 00:36:07,251
As stupid as it sounds, I viewed them
as a form of masturbation for him.

499
00:36:07,711 --> 00:36:10,380
I couldn't give him what
he needed all the time.

500
00:36:11,466 --> 00:36:13,550
You're a man.
You know that thirst.

501
00:36:15,595 --> 00:36:19,348
I was too busy with the house
and the kids to quench it.

502
00:36:21,476 --> 00:36:23,519
But this psychiatrist...

503
00:36:23,812 --> 00:36:26,438
...you know, she's not just a goomar.

504
00:36:27,566 --> 00:36:32,070
Now I feel like he's really cheating
and I'm the one who's thirsty.

505
00:36:33,155 --> 00:36:35,824
I'm not gonna stay in a marriage
that's made...

506
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:39,160
Let's not even think about that.

507
00:36:39,995 --> 00:36:45,166
Divorce is for those who never intended
on dying married in the first place.

508
00:36:48,338 --> 00:36:50,965
You know, Carm, we reap what we sow.

509
00:36:52,008 --> 00:36:53,384
What do you mean?

510
00:36:53,635 --> 00:36:56,595
You admit to accepting
his dalliances in the past.

511
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:58,848
Schifosas.
They meant nothing.

512
00:36:59,015 --> 00:37:03,978
But you said it was like they were
"lightening the workload"...

513
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:07,774
...providing a wife's duty
when you were too busy.

514
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:10,318
You practically welcomed it.

515
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,656
Now, I want you to pray...

516
00:37:14,907 --> 00:37:19,661
...to our Holy Mother, ask her
for guidance and forgiveness...

517
00:37:19,955 --> 00:37:23,207
...so that you can get through
this as a couple.

518
00:37:25,461 --> 00:37:28,212
You're not without sin
in this, Carmela.

519
00:37:30,549 --> 00:37:31,591
So she's out of control.

520
00:37:31,843 --> 00:37:35,220
She spends money like we're
the Sopranos of Park Avenue.

521
00:37:35,388 --> 00:37:38,724
But you've noticed her.
Which may have been the point.

522
00:37:41,394 --> 00:37:44,271
Look, before we run out of time...

523
00:37:44,564 --> 00:37:48,859
...I'd like to discuss what happened
when we were here last week.

524
00:37:53,365 --> 00:37:54,491
How's your car?

525
00:37:56,994 --> 00:37:59,412
Did you steal my car
and have it fixed?

526
00:38:01,749 --> 00:38:06,377
- We had an agreement, no gifts.
- I didn't want you to get robbed.

527
00:38:06,755 --> 00:38:07,963
It was you.

528
00:38:08,924 --> 00:38:12,176
You had no right to steal my car.

529
00:38:13,428 --> 00:38:15,012
I've been scared to death.

530
00:38:15,388 --> 00:38:16,597
- Why?
- Why?

531
00:38:16,806 --> 00:38:20,267
It's a violation of my privacy.
What else have you done?

532
00:38:24,273 --> 00:38:25,815
Answer me.

533
00:38:29,445 --> 00:38:30,612
I love you.

534
00:38:30,947 --> 00:38:33,240
- Anthony.
- I'm in love with you.

535
00:38:34,575 --> 00:38:37,285
I'm sorry. It's just the way it is.

536
00:38:37,454 --> 00:38:39,288
- Okay. Let me talk.
- No.

537
00:38:39,456 --> 00:38:41,457
It's not the Prozac.

538
00:38:43,335 --> 00:38:45,044
I dream about you.

539
00:38:45,796 --> 00:38:47,964
I think about you all the time.

540
00:38:48,131 --> 00:38:50,299
I can't get excited about
other women.

541
00:38:51,802 --> 00:38:53,594
There's nothing else to say.

542
00:38:55,807 --> 00:38:57,349
I love you.

543
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,351
Let me start here.

544
00:38:59,686 --> 00:39:02,688
I know this may be very hard
for you to swallow.

545
00:39:03,815 --> 00:39:07,317
But you're only feeling this way
because we've made such progress.

546
00:39:07,694 --> 00:39:10,654
- What?
- I've been gentle. That's my job.

547
00:39:11,824 --> 00:39:14,993
I listen. That's what I do best.

548
00:39:15,244 --> 00:39:18,329
I've been a broad, generic,
sympathetic woman to you...

549
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:21,457
...because that's what
this work calls for.

550
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:28,047
You've made me all of the things
you feel are missing in your wife.

551
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,843
And in your mother.

552
00:39:37,934 --> 00:39:41,687
You're making me out to be
some fucking mama's boy.

553
00:39:42,189 --> 00:39:43,773
I'm a man.

554
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,067
And you're a woman.

555
00:39:46,569 --> 00:39:48,361
End of story.

556
00:39:48,779 --> 00:39:52,157
And this crap about Freud and...

557
00:39:52,575 --> 00:39:56,703
...every boy wanting to have sex with
his mother, that's not gonna fly here.

558
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,206
I didn't say that.

559
00:39:59,499 --> 00:40:02,168
I want to make sure
we understand each other.

560
00:40:02,586 --> 00:40:04,629
Yeah, we understand each other.

561
00:40:07,716 --> 00:40:09,216
You don't love me.

562
00:40:14,432 --> 00:40:16,475
You don't want me
to come back anymore.

563
00:40:16,726 --> 00:40:18,727
It's quite the opposite.

564
00:40:19,228 --> 00:40:22,773
This is all a byproduct of progress.

565
00:40:22,982 --> 00:40:24,900
Has someone been following me?

566
00:40:27,654 --> 00:40:28,904
Okay, forget it.

567
00:40:30,783 --> 00:40:32,450
I'll see you next week.

568
00:40:43,462 --> 00:40:44,629
All right, let's go!

569
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,924
- Listen, Uncle Junior...
- You could've made the pros.

570
00:40:48,134 --> 00:40:51,470
You could've done it.
You had a swing like Joe D.

571
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,055
- You're crazy.
- What?

572
00:40:53,306 --> 00:40:54,807
You think I'm shitting you?

573
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:58,143
- I could barely hit.250.
- Because you didn't want it.

574
00:40:58,436 --> 00:41:02,064
Too busy chasing skirt.
Chasing skirt, your average was.500.

575
00:41:02,775 --> 00:41:05,777
- Yeah, what happened?
- What did you want to talk about?

576
00:41:07,405 --> 00:41:08,446
Octavian.

577
00:41:10,241 --> 00:41:13,284
- You know, Augustus.
- You fucking with me?

578
00:41:13,786 --> 00:41:16,788
No. Octavian became Augustus.

579
00:41:19,459 --> 00:41:20,793
Forget about that.

580
00:41:21,461 --> 00:41:25,464
Bottom line: Augustus was a Caesar.
And everybody loved him, right?

581
00:41:26,842 --> 00:41:29,468
- You know why?
- I don't know that I give a fuck.

582
00:41:29,803 --> 00:41:33,723
Everybody loved him because
he never ate alone. Capisci?

583
00:41:33,933 --> 00:41:36,685
It was the longest time of peace
in Rome's history.

584
00:41:36,936 --> 00:41:40,647
He was a fair leader and all
his people loved him for that.

585
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:43,483
Is this the one that
they stabbed in the back?

586
00:41:43,693 --> 00:41:46,319
No, that was Julius.
Talking about Augustus.

587
00:41:46,654 --> 00:41:49,823
He shared his wealth and
all his people loved him.

588
00:41:50,325 --> 00:41:51,868
You said that three times.

589
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:55,329
I heard it. His people loved him.
What's your point?

590
00:41:59,001 --> 00:42:01,753
Remember when you told me
about the bull and his son?

591
00:42:02,629 --> 00:42:05,173
They're looking out
at a bunch of cows.

592
00:42:05,382 --> 00:42:09,552
The son says, "Dad, why don't we
run down and fuck one of these cows?"

593
00:42:09,804 --> 00:42:11,096
What did the dad say?

594
00:42:12,766 --> 00:42:16,643
The father says, "Son, why don't we
walk down there and fuck them all?"

595
00:42:18,396 --> 00:42:21,440
I told you that?
"Why don't we fuck them all."

596
00:42:21,691 --> 00:42:23,066
That's funny.

597
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,571
Okay, I get your point.

598
00:42:26,822 --> 00:42:29,991
Why all of this fucking
Augustus-Octavian shit?

599
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:31,576
I don't know.

600
00:42:32,661 --> 00:42:35,830
Are you okay? You've been
acting mezzo morto lately.

601
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,333
I ain't seen you like that for years.

602
00:42:38,627 --> 00:42:43,214
I'm okay. It's just bullshit stuff.
Don't worry about it.

603
00:42:43,799 --> 00:42:46,884
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm okay.

604
00:42:51,097 --> 00:42:54,642
Junior took your 250 and
split it amongst the top five guys.

605
00:42:54,894 --> 00:42:56,520
So he doesn't look greedy.

606
00:42:56,729 --> 00:42:57,896
- Smart move.
- Yeah.

607
00:42:58,147 --> 00:43:00,440
Your uncle may be another
Harry Truman.

608
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:03,401
- What's that mean?
- Truman had a big job thrust on him.

609
00:43:03,653 --> 00:43:07,864
He didn't want it, but in the end
he made some pretty wise decisions.

610
00:43:08,074 --> 00:43:10,408
Your uncle may be the right man.

611
00:43:12,496 --> 00:43:13,621
I fucking hope so.

612
00:43:13,872 --> 00:43:15,873
I'll tell you, I don't want the job.

613
00:43:16,083 --> 00:43:17,875
Let Junior die from the stress.

614
00:43:18,669 --> 00:43:21,420
That's what gave Jackie the cancer,
God rest his soul.

615
00:43:22,005 --> 00:43:24,090
"Boss." Fuck it, who needs it?

616
00:43:34,936 --> 00:43:36,436
It's nice here.

617
00:43:36,688 --> 00:43:39,982
I can't stand the smell.
The shit, flies all over.

618
00:43:40,233 --> 00:43:44,194
But I could watch them for hours.
There's a kind of beauty to it.

619
00:43:44,446 --> 00:43:45,446
I envy them.

620
00:43:45,781 --> 00:43:47,866
- I wouldn't go that far.
- I would.

621
00:43:48,075 --> 00:43:52,954
They got no bills, no headaches,
no family cazzi running around.

622
00:43:53,205 --> 00:43:55,790
One horse likes another one,
they fuck. That's it.

623
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,502
No problems. No hundred questions.
No guilt.

624
00:44:02,841 --> 00:44:04,925
I don't know what I'm talking about.

625
00:44:05,802 --> 00:44:08,137
So Junior split my money
and spread it around?

626
00:44:09,389 --> 00:44:11,932
- Yeah.
- Five bosses, 50 a pop.

627
00:44:12,142 --> 00:44:13,225
Not a bad day's pay.

628
00:44:15,646 --> 00:44:17,647
Still, I wish it wasn't your money.

629
00:44:18,733 --> 00:44:21,151
You know, it makes me feel terrible.

630
00:44:24,155 --> 00:44:25,155
What?

631
00:44:29,368 --> 00:44:30,577
You old fucking Jew.

632
00:44:30,828 --> 00:44:33,997
Here's my share.
I don't want to profit off you.

633
00:44:38,462 --> 00:44:40,171
Never entered my mind.

634
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:03,278
Dr. Melfi, there's nothing there,
you know.

635
00:45:03,488 --> 00:45:05,822
You don't have to explain
nothing, Tony.

636
00:45:08,702 --> 00:45:13,539
In psychiatry, apparently what you're
feeling is not what you're feeling.

637
00:45:13,791 --> 00:45:16,542
And what you're not feeling
is your real agenda.

638
00:45:30,725 --> 00:45:33,936
- You're gonna stick with it, right?
- I don't know.

639
00:45:34,479 --> 00:45:36,063
I think you should.

640
00:45:36,315 --> 00:45:37,732
You do?

641
00:45:41,696 --> 00:45:43,113
I was jealous.

642
00:45:43,531 --> 00:45:46,241
- I should've...
- Wait, let me finish, Tony.

643
00:45:48,577 --> 00:45:50,870
I've been thinking a lot about this.

644
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,252
I was jealous of her ability
to help you.

645
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:00,631
To be a sort of salvation to you.

646
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:03,092
I talked to Father Phil and...

647
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:07,263
...I want to be that woman
in your life.

648
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,732
Carm, you're not just in my life...

649
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:19,776
...you are my life.

650
00:46:24,742 --> 00:46:25,908
Come here.

651
00:46:44,804 --> 00:46:46,138
I'm no good at speeches.

652
00:46:46,306 --> 00:46:49,308
Owe him a dime,
you'll hear some great speeches.

653
00:46:50,226 --> 00:46:52,478
Shit. Shut up, let me talk.

654
00:46:52,687 --> 00:46:54,480
Go ahead. I was only kidding.

655
00:46:54,814 --> 00:46:57,649
I'd like everybody
to raise their glasses.

656
00:47:07,661 --> 00:47:08,995
Okay.

657
00:47:10,831 --> 00:47:14,793
Taught me as much as anybody,
except for maybe my father.

658
00:47:17,422 --> 00:47:19,465
Even if he wasn't my uncle...

659
00:47:20,634 --> 00:47:22,635
...I'd be standing here saying:

660
00:47:22,928 --> 00:47:24,428
"To our new boss."

661
00:47:26,014 --> 00:47:27,014
Salute.

662
00:47:29,644 --> 00:47:31,186
To Junior.

663
00:47:32,021 --> 00:47:33,438
Junior.

664
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:36,608
To Junior.

665
00:47:37,443 --> 00:47:38,652
Salute.


1
00:01:38,517 --> 00:01:39,684
Here, take a swig.

2
00:01:39,893 --> 00:01:41,561
And don't backwash.

3
00:01:41,854 --> 00:01:43,437
Shit! Don't break it.

4
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:45,481
It's time for the nuns' rosary.

5
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:48,734
This is 8th-grade history.
Stealing the sacramental wine?

6
00:01:49,027 --> 00:01:51,070
It's not sacramental
till they bless it.

7
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:53,407
All clear!
Are you gonna confess this?

8
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,326
I'll tell them I stole something,
not what.

9
00:01:57,537 --> 00:02:00,455
Go! Form it up!
Form it up, let's go, boys.

10
00:02:00,665 --> 00:02:02,624
Hustle, hustle, hustle!

11
00:02:02,876 --> 00:02:05,836
There we go, straight lines.
Straight lines.

12
00:02:06,254 --> 00:02:07,296
There you go.

13
00:02:07,589 --> 00:02:09,631
Soprano, DiCarlucci, shake a leg.

14
00:02:09,883 --> 00:02:12,718
Jumping jacks.
Ten of them, count them down.

15
00:02:13,095 --> 00:02:14,971
- Three, four, five...
- Two, three...

16
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:19,100
- ...six, seven, eight...
- ...four, five, six...

17
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,187
- ...nine, ten.
- ...seven, eight, nine...

18
00:02:25,733 --> 00:02:28,860
DiCarlucci, Barber, Soprano,
let's go! Sync up!

19
00:02:30,988 --> 00:02:32,655
What's so funny? Care to share?

20
00:02:33,866 --> 00:02:35,867
Sorry, Mr. Meskimmin.

21
00:02:38,872 --> 00:02:40,706
Okay, kick-outs, boys!

22
00:02:40,999 --> 00:02:42,458
Floor! Kick!

23
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:44,460
Return! Up!

24
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:46,712
I'm dizzier than shit!

25
00:02:47,005 --> 00:02:49,882
Kick! Return! Up!

26
00:02:50,508 --> 00:02:51,926
Fuck, here he comes.

27
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:55,763
Whoa, floor, kick, turn, up!

28
00:02:58,476 --> 00:02:59,976
What's going on here?

29
00:03:00,436 --> 00:03:03,355
Come on, stand up, on your feet,
let's go.

30
00:03:07,652 --> 00:03:08,818
Whoa.

31
00:03:08,986 --> 00:03:11,488
- Man!
- I don't feel so good.

32
00:03:11,697 --> 00:03:13,406
I don't want any excuses.

33
00:03:13,824 --> 00:03:17,619
Mr. Meskimmin, I gotta go
to the bathroom.

34
00:03:17,828 --> 00:03:19,829
Is that alcohol on your breath?

35
00:03:39,476 --> 00:03:40,685
Hey, how's the boy?

36
00:03:40,852 --> 00:03:45,481
How am I? I got dust up the crack
of my ass, and I'm starving to death.

37
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,860
You're doing an excellent job.
Take pleasure in that.

38
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:53,323
He's been ragging in my ear all day.
I'd like to kill him. Hear that, prick?

39
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,535
Get him out of here.
Just get him the hell out of here.

40
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:59,371
- Is there a problem?
- You made your point.

41
00:03:59,664 --> 00:04:01,707
- I made my point.
- You made your point.

42
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,834
- What point?
- Enough with work stoppage.

43
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:08,964
This union safety official stays until
he deems this place is free of hazard.

44
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:11,384
- I have the money.
- You do?

45
00:04:12,177 --> 00:04:15,263
Christopher, see if he's paid up
his union dues...

46
00:04:15,514 --> 00:04:18,224
...then pop a wheel cover
to check the brakes.

47
00:04:18,434 --> 00:04:20,226
I'll get right on it.

48
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:24,897
I'll get your money, okay?

49
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,774
We shall return.

50
00:04:27,526 --> 00:04:29,694
Halle-fucking-lujah!

51
00:04:30,697 --> 00:04:33,032
Give me your cell.
I gotta call Carmela.

52
00:04:35,994 --> 00:04:37,036
You sure it was them?

53
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:41,582
They were drunk in gym class. Byron
Barber vomited all over the teacher.

54
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,459
I spat it out.

55
00:04:43,668 --> 00:04:44,668
Anthony.

56
00:04:44,836 --> 00:04:46,837
You're gonna lie to me now?

57
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:50,466
He's sorry, Father Hagy.
He'll be sorrier when he gets home.

58
00:04:50,718 --> 00:04:52,677
Anthony, why don't you wait outside?

59
00:05:00,978 --> 00:05:03,438
He's suspended for three days.

60
00:05:04,357 --> 00:05:05,690
Let me pay for the wine.

61
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,234
This isn't just
a crime against property...

62
00:05:08,444 --> 00:05:10,862
...it's an affront
to our holy sacristy.

63
00:05:12,782 --> 00:05:15,992
I've asked Dr. Galani,
our school psychologist, to join us.

64
00:05:17,371 --> 00:05:20,915
He's been keeping an eye on Anthony.
Meeting with his teachers.

65
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,626
Why don't you pick it up
from there, doctor?

66
00:05:25,462 --> 00:05:27,922
Um, hi.

67
00:05:28,507 --> 00:05:32,426
In many respects, Anthony is
a normal, healthy 8th-grader.

68
00:05:32,636 --> 00:05:34,929
Sister Patricia, his art teacher...

69
00:05:35,138 --> 00:05:38,641
...thinks he shows strong skills
in spatial orientation.

70
00:05:39,811 --> 00:05:43,105
But the thing is, and it's not
just this one incident...

71
00:05:43,314 --> 00:05:46,983
...Anthony sometimes has trouble
following the rules...

72
00:05:48,152 --> 00:05:49,486
...weighing consequences.

73
00:05:51,531 --> 00:05:54,324
At times, doesn't think
before he acts.

74
00:05:54,492 --> 00:05:55,534
And...

75
00:05:55,952 --> 00:06:00,664
...it's thought that there's a good
possibility Anthony could be ADD.

76
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:03,584
ADD?

77
00:06:03,794 --> 00:06:06,295
- Attention deficit disorder.
- I knew it.

78
00:06:06,505 --> 00:06:08,756
- I knew there was something.
- What is it?

79
00:06:09,007 --> 00:06:10,842
It's an aggregate of symptoms.

80
00:06:11,051 --> 00:06:13,344
Inattention, impulsivity...

81
00:06:13,595 --> 00:06:17,014
...sometimes, although not always,
hyperactivity.

82
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:20,017
To be sure, we'll give him
a thorough evaluation.

83
00:06:20,644 --> 00:06:22,478
He needs a whack upside the head.

84
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:25,065
If he's got an illness?
It's an illness, right?

85
00:06:25,692 --> 00:06:29,361
You'd hit somebody who's sick?
You'd hit somebody with polio?

86
00:06:32,365 --> 00:06:33,824
You hit Anthony?

87
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:37,703
Nobody gets hit in our house.
Not exactly my idea.

88
00:06:38,329 --> 00:06:41,707
What's happening if you can't
do a little tarantella on the kids...

89
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,001
...when they step out of line?

90
00:06:44,587 --> 00:06:45,879
So what happens now?

91
00:06:46,088 --> 00:06:48,381
He'll be given a complete battery
of testing.

92
00:06:48,632 --> 00:06:51,342
Psychological, behavioral, medical.

93
00:06:51,552 --> 00:06:53,219
Let me ask you a question.

94
00:06:53,512 --> 00:06:56,473
These other kids,
you keeping an eye on them?

95
00:06:56,724 --> 00:06:59,851
Are you testing them?
The ones that aren't named Soprano?

96
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:02,270
There's no immediate plans for that.

97
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,066
We attend to every child at Verbum Dei
according to his own circumstances.

98
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:11,405
And so what do we,
as the parents, do?

99
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:13,073
Nothing?

100
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:18,454
Oh, no, I mean, Anthony's misbehaved.
He should be consequenced.

101
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:22,500
It's a crime!

102
00:07:22,751 --> 00:07:27,254
To suspend that child from school
with all the money you give them?

103
00:07:27,506 --> 00:07:32,468
That gym teacher shit a brick when your
friend puked on his boots, huh, Anthony?

104
00:07:33,262 --> 00:07:34,513
Want to encourage him?

105
00:07:34,722 --> 00:07:37,015
Whatever happened
to "boys will be boys"?

106
00:07:37,225 --> 00:07:40,393
He stole from the church.
They don't make them any lower.

107
00:07:40,645 --> 00:07:43,230
- What a loser.
- That's enough out of you.

108
00:07:43,481 --> 00:07:46,233
Oh, his father was the same way.

109
00:07:46,859 --> 00:07:49,694
I practically lived
in that vice principal's office.

110
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:52,405
Could we not, please?

111
00:07:52,616 --> 00:07:55,034
You only remember
what you want to remember.

112
00:07:56,078 --> 00:07:58,412
Yeah, well, I must've had
another son...

113
00:07:58,622 --> 00:08:01,332
...who stole a car when he was
10 years old.

114
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,960
He could barely see over the wheel.

115
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:06,754
He was a hellion.
Him and his little crew...

116
00:08:06,964 --> 00:08:08,965
...they stole lobsters on the boats...

117
00:08:09,174 --> 00:08:12,134
...and sold them for a buck
on Bloomfield Avenue.

118
00:08:12,344 --> 00:08:13,344
Really?

119
00:08:14,138 --> 00:08:17,349
How many times must I say it?
I don't want that talk in front of him.

120
00:08:17,642 --> 00:08:19,601
That is wrong, and I don't condone it!

121
00:08:19,811 --> 00:08:21,019
Yeah. Sure.

122
00:08:21,354 --> 00:08:23,146
- Who are you yelling at?
- What?

123
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,690
You stupe.

124
00:08:24,857 --> 00:08:27,109
- What did you say?
- I didn't say anything.

125
00:08:27,443 --> 00:08:29,570
What's he doing now? What's going on?

126
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:30,779
He yells at me...

127
00:08:30,947 --> 00:08:33,740
Anthony, I thought this could wait
till after dinner.

128
00:08:33,992 --> 00:08:35,450
Your father and I have talked.

129
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,663
You are not to play Mario Cart
or go skateboarding for three weeks.

130
00:08:39,957 --> 00:08:41,583
And no TV.

131
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:42,792
No.

132
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,919
You won't sit on that Internet.

133
00:08:45,087 --> 00:08:48,590
And every day, you'll ride your bike
to go visit Grandma.

134
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,174
Oh, that'll be nice.

135
00:08:50,384 --> 00:08:51,676
It's not fair!

136
00:09:02,022 --> 00:09:05,774
- Some fucking day, huh?
- I feel like a bomb went off.

137
00:09:08,653 --> 00:09:12,990
You know that stuff the doctor said?
I never saw any of that in Anthony.

138
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:16,035
You never notice how he picks
at the tongue of his shoe?

139
00:09:16,328 --> 00:09:18,537
Like he can't help himself.

140
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:21,165
If he even has this thing.

141
00:09:21,374 --> 00:09:23,542
Something's going on.

142
00:09:30,635 --> 00:09:32,761
- Carm?
- Yep?

143
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:36,222
- Do you think he knows?
- I don't know.

144
00:09:37,183 --> 00:09:38,850
She knows.

145
00:09:40,227 --> 00:09:42,062
- Are you...?
- Really?

146
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,315
- What makes you say that?
- Are you in...?

147
00:09:46,193 --> 00:09:50,738
I don't know. Things she says. She
makes remarks, like this today with him.

148
00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:56,661
- Are you in the Mafia?
- She talk to you about me?

149
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,120
Talk? To me?

150
00:10:05,796 --> 00:10:07,755
Something happen on that college trip?

151
00:10:10,134 --> 00:10:11,134
Happen?

152
00:10:13,096 --> 00:10:14,096
Like what?

153
00:10:14,263 --> 00:10:17,349
I don't know, she seemed peculiar
when she got back.

154
00:10:21,604 --> 00:10:24,439
I think pretty soon we're gonna
have to, you know...

155
00:10:24,774 --> 00:10:27,359
...talk to her about the business.

156
00:10:27,652 --> 00:10:30,696
Yeah. The two of us
should sit down with Meadow.

157
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,032
Talk as a family.

158
00:10:34,118 --> 00:10:37,412
With him, they'll test him
and we'll see what's what.

159
00:10:39,415 --> 00:10:40,456
Right?

160
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:46,212
Good night.

161
00:10:47,297 --> 00:10:48,464
Good night.

162
00:11:02,814 --> 00:11:05,566
Maybe I don't want to admit
something's wrong with my kid...

163
00:11:05,817 --> 00:11:07,609
...but this sounds like bullshit.

164
00:11:07,902 --> 00:11:08,986
What do you mean?

165
00:11:09,195 --> 00:11:12,990
If he's got a disease, why punish him?
Isn't that bullshit?

166
00:11:13,241 --> 00:11:15,451
ADD is a controversial subject.

167
00:11:15,661 --> 00:11:19,831
Is it a disease, or a way for
psychologists to line their pockets?

168
00:11:24,128 --> 00:11:28,131
Many children can really benefit
by professional intervention.

169
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,632
He got in trouble.

170
00:11:29,842 --> 00:11:32,719
So you don't consider his behavior
out of the norm?

171
00:11:32,928 --> 00:11:34,179
No.

172
00:11:36,015 --> 00:11:37,432
I don't know.

173
00:11:38,185 --> 00:11:39,935
What do I know about it?

174
00:11:40,187 --> 00:11:41,187
What do you mean?

175
00:11:41,688 --> 00:11:43,898
Oh, I gotta spell it out for you?

176
00:11:44,191 --> 00:11:48,402
Do you see his behavior
as a reflection of your own?

177
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:55,743
Look, like I said, maybe I don't want
to admit there's something wrong...

178
00:11:56,703 --> 00:11:58,913
...but if he's got this thing...

179
00:11:59,372 --> 00:12:00,748
...we'll deal with it.

180
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:03,668
If he had polio, we'd deal with it.

181
00:12:04,378 --> 00:12:07,214
You pick up the pieces
and you go on from there.

182
00:12:08,716 --> 00:12:10,759
So that's what we're gonna do.

183
00:12:19,685 --> 00:12:22,187
Do you want to say anything else
about this?

184
00:12:27,402 --> 00:12:32,031
Well, last time you were telling me
that you had intimate feelings for me.

185
00:12:32,908 --> 00:12:34,909
But you've not mentioned it.

186
00:12:35,953 --> 00:12:37,495
Intimate feelings?

187
00:12:37,955 --> 00:12:39,914
I think I said I was in love.

188
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,835
How are you doing with it?

189
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:50,968
I can't turn off my feelings because
you say it's a byproduct of therapy.

190
00:12:51,469 --> 00:12:53,971
I never said to
turn off your feelings.

191
00:12:55,723 --> 00:12:57,766
Well, I already got a girlfriend.

192
00:12:58,518 --> 00:13:01,395
She's Russian, 24.

193
00:13:09,238 --> 00:13:10,238
How old are you?

194
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:16,953
It's interesting it took you so long
to tell me you had a girlfriend.

195
00:13:17,621 --> 00:13:19,205
How are you doing with it?

196
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,671
I gotta ask you one more question
about my son.

197
00:13:27,965 --> 00:13:31,885
You think I should
go easy on him now...

198
00:13:32,095 --> 00:13:33,637
...or press him harder?

199
00:13:33,972 --> 00:13:35,806
That's difficult to say.

200
00:13:37,475 --> 00:13:41,020
What, you want a raise, maybe,
to figure this out?

201
00:13:45,817 --> 00:13:49,486
Anthony! Anthony Jr., you get up!

202
00:13:49,654 --> 00:13:52,907
Why? I don't have to go to school.
I'm suspended.

203
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:57,829
No lying in bed all day.
We're not running a hotel over here.

204
00:13:58,497 --> 00:13:59,998
Get up, have some breakfast!

205
00:14:00,249 --> 00:14:02,500
I don't want any. I'm not hungry.

206
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:06,671
What you are gonna do today
is get up and go rake.

207
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:09,633
Then pull all of those leaves
out of the pool filter.

208
00:14:09,884 --> 00:14:12,177
You're gonna do some work around here.

209
00:14:12,428 --> 00:14:14,763
Mom, where's my gray jacket?

210
00:14:15,014 --> 00:14:18,016
I left it downstairs.
What'd you do with it?

211
00:14:18,268 --> 00:14:19,644
Hello?

212
00:14:21,271 --> 00:14:25,691
Anthony, turn off that music!
Your father is sleeping!

213
00:14:25,984 --> 00:14:28,152
You said I couldn't watch TV
or play Nintendo.

214
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,696
- What?
- You said nothing about music!

215
00:14:30,989 --> 00:14:33,991
- Turn it off right now!
- Why?

216
00:14:35,494 --> 00:14:37,912
Your father is sleeping,
for chrissake!

217
00:14:39,415 --> 00:14:42,042
Mom, I can't find it. Where is it?

218
00:15:02,147 --> 00:15:03,481
Hey, Johnny!

219
00:15:03,857 --> 00:15:05,233
Johnny, come on!

220
00:15:07,236 --> 00:15:09,320
Uncle Jun, why are you here so early?

221
00:15:09,571 --> 00:15:12,073
Anthony, where's your dad?
He said he'd be outside.

222
00:15:12,408 --> 00:15:13,950
Want me to go get him?

223
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,996
Did you hear the game last night?
Joey Pepitone, three RBIs.

224
00:15:18,455 --> 00:15:20,415
No kidding.
My mom made me go to bed.

225
00:15:20,624 --> 00:15:22,333
You miss your bus to school...

226
00:15:22,584 --> 00:15:24,794
...you walk through
the colored neighborhood.

227
00:15:25,255 --> 00:15:27,923
Junior! Big fancy car.

228
00:15:28,174 --> 00:15:30,968
We're going to my sister's,
and you promised to...

229
00:15:32,053 --> 00:15:34,263
Nonstop!
Don't you get sick of yourself?

230
00:15:35,015 --> 00:15:37,933
Dad, could you and Uncle Jun give me
a ride to school?

231
00:15:38,184 --> 00:15:40,269
Not now, Tony.
You be good, though.

232
00:15:40,478 --> 00:15:43,605
Pay attention to what
those teachers tell you.

233
00:15:43,857 --> 00:15:44,857
Okay.

234
00:15:48,654 --> 00:15:51,281
- See you, Ma.
- Okay. Be good.

235
00:16:06,047 --> 00:16:07,297
Hey, wait up!

236
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,842
Shit!

237
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:13,512
Hey, Rocco!

238
00:16:13,805 --> 00:16:16,015
Come on, move, move, guys!
Move, move!

239
00:16:16,224 --> 00:16:20,227
Hey, John, one more day, man!
One more day.

240
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:24,106
- There's gonna be a huge payoff.
- I'm gonna kill you!

241
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,613
What do you got?

242
00:16:30,822 --> 00:16:34,825
What the fuck is this?
What the fuck are you bringing me here?

243
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,539
Who are you fucking with, Rocco?

244
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,335
- Fuck you!
- Motherfucker!

245
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,796
You asshole!

246
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,090
What are you bringing to me here?

247
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:50,467
Piece of shit!

248
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,136
What the fucking...?

249
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,224
Christ!

250
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:07,193
You're up.

251
00:17:08,112 --> 00:17:11,280
Who the fuck can sleep
with all this shit going on?

252
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:15,368
I thought about Jefferson Airplane
this morning. How about that?

253
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:18,079
1967.

254
00:17:18,456 --> 00:17:21,041
- Made me think of my father.
- What about him?

255
00:17:23,586 --> 00:17:26,130
First time I saw him
whack the shit out of somebody.

256
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:28,465
What made you think about that?

257
00:17:29,801 --> 00:17:33,470
Something to do with my son, I think,
what's been going on.

258
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:39,601
Why did your father
whack the shit out of some guy?

259
00:17:40,146 --> 00:17:42,730
I never saw him do something
like that.

260
00:17:42,898 --> 00:17:45,275
He used to whack us kids around
a little.

261
00:17:45,526 --> 00:17:46,734
Really?

262
00:17:47,903 --> 00:17:51,739
Yeah, the belt was his favorite
child development tool.

263
00:17:53,576 --> 00:17:54,909
This was different.

264
00:17:55,744 --> 00:17:57,954
You could tell he knew
what he was doing.

265
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,000
How did you feel about
your father after that?

266
00:18:02,502 --> 00:18:04,628
I didn't want him to do it to me.

267
00:18:05,046 --> 00:18:06,672
Seriously.

268
00:18:06,923 --> 00:18:09,758
What should I say?
I was glad he wasn't a fag.

269
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:12,928
- How did you and your father get along?
- Good.

270
00:18:13,221 --> 00:18:16,265
He was a good guy, my father.
Everybody liked him.

271
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:18,392
He knew how to have a good time.

272
00:18:18,894 --> 00:18:21,645
He loved shellfish, clams, oysters.

273
00:18:22,647 --> 00:18:26,901
Taught us how to eat them. You put
Worcestershire on, suck them down.

274
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,237
It's good.

275
00:18:29,739 --> 00:18:32,115
My mother never ate anything raw.

276
00:18:34,702 --> 00:18:36,494
But he wasn't around much.

277
00:18:37,622 --> 00:18:39,206
What did he do for a living?

278
00:18:39,457 --> 00:18:41,625
Retail meat and provisions.

279
00:18:45,671 --> 00:18:48,340
And a little numbers,
extortion, loan-sharking.

280
00:18:48,634 --> 00:18:50,051
How did you feel about that?

281
00:18:50,344 --> 00:18:52,762
- How did I feel?
- About your father...

282
00:18:53,472 --> 00:18:55,765
...being engaged
in illegal activities?

283
00:18:57,476 --> 00:18:59,852
You know,
I never really knew about it.

284
00:19:00,062 --> 00:19:01,395
When did you find out?

285
00:19:01,605 --> 00:19:02,980
Who remembers?

286
00:19:03,899 --> 00:19:06,400
You thought of that incident
this morning.

287
00:19:06,818 --> 00:19:10,363
Are you concerned that your son is
going to find out about you?

288
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,242
Don't talk to me about
legitimate business.

289
00:19:13,493 --> 00:19:15,244
What about chemical companies?

290
00:19:15,453 --> 00:19:20,290
Dumping that shit into rivers and they
got deformed babies popping up all over.

291
00:19:22,043 --> 00:19:23,669
Does he know anything?

292
00:19:24,629 --> 00:19:25,796
I don't know.

293
00:19:26,214 --> 00:19:27,256
Has he asked you?

294
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:28,966
No.

295
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:32,010
- How will you handle that?
- I don't know.

296
00:19:32,763 --> 00:19:35,056
Did you ever talk to
your father about it?

297
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:36,349
Are you kidding?

298
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:46,859
No kidding, Tony.
That doesn't sound like Anthony.

299
00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:49,612
Yesterday, he's a boy.
Today, I worry about him.

300
00:19:49,863 --> 00:19:51,197
Teenagers.

301
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,617
My daughter gives me
feminist shit about this place.

302
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:58,330
How it "objectifies women."
Shit like that.

303
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,541
These girls pull down 1500 a week.

304
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:03,544
This bears no weight
with the principessa.

305
00:20:03,837 --> 00:20:06,213
Meadow was one thing,
but this is my son.

306
00:20:06,423 --> 00:20:08,549
Boys are different from girls.

307
00:20:09,634 --> 00:20:14,221
Pussy, Kevin and Matt, they ever ask
you about this thing of ours?

308
00:20:14,389 --> 00:20:17,099
I lied through my teeth,
but they knew. Fucking nitwits.

309
00:20:17,393 --> 00:20:19,227
They love me anyway.

310
00:20:20,229 --> 00:20:22,731
It's hard to raise kids
in an information age.

311
00:20:23,065 --> 00:20:25,066
You know, to protect them.

312
00:20:30,531 --> 00:20:31,906
Hey, what's up?

313
00:20:32,241 --> 00:20:36,077
Who's got an anniversary
or a special occasion?

314
00:20:36,579 --> 00:20:37,954
What are these, antiques?

315
00:20:38,247 --> 00:20:42,083
I was picking up the Chinaman's vig,
and the FedEx van was wide open.

316
00:20:42,252 --> 00:20:44,086
The guy went in for a burger.

317
00:20:44,254 --> 00:20:48,132
No shit, FedEx. They're usually
pretty careful with those.

318
00:20:48,467 --> 00:20:49,884
You did this in daylight?

319
00:20:50,052 --> 00:20:51,427
Nobody saw me.

320
00:20:51,678 --> 00:20:53,137
That's interstate commerce.

321
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,640
You want to be in prison
for a stunt like that, be my guest.

322
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,602
I'd take a licking
but keep on ticking.

323
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,437
I'm getting out of here.

324
00:21:01,646 --> 00:21:03,272
Jesus Christ!

325
00:21:05,026 --> 00:21:06,109
What's with his ass?

326
00:21:07,028 --> 00:21:09,112
He's got a lot on his mind.

327
00:21:11,908 --> 00:21:14,785
What do you think is going on
in this one, Anthony?

328
00:21:15,661 --> 00:21:18,080
I don't know.
How many more are left?

329
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:20,499
The quicker you answer,
the faster we'll be done.

330
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:25,295
Whatever pops in your mind.

331
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,298
There's no guy?

332
00:21:27,925 --> 00:21:31,010
Okay, good.
Where do you think he is?

333
00:21:32,638 --> 00:21:34,472
Out buying food for the horse?

334
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,475
Anything else?

335
00:21:38,811 --> 00:21:40,853
Watching TV, maybe?

336
00:21:41,647 --> 00:21:44,649
Maybe he's watching South Park.
Number one's on tonight.

337
00:21:44,858 --> 00:21:49,695
Aliens abduct Cartman and give him an
anal probe and it makes him fart fire.

338
00:21:56,246 --> 00:21:57,496
You're home.

339
00:21:58,456 --> 00:22:02,376
You know, if it's bad, the ADD,
they put Anthony in special ed.

340
00:22:05,797 --> 00:22:06,839
The doctors say that?

341
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:10,426
Doctors don't know anything yet.
They started testing today.

342
00:22:10,636 --> 00:22:12,387
I picked up these books at the mall.

343
00:22:12,596 --> 00:22:14,389
Help Me To Help My Child?

344
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,015
Listen to this.

345
00:22:16,267 --> 00:22:18,685
"About 50% of children
diagnosed with ADD...

346
00:22:18,936 --> 00:22:21,646
...receive help from
special education teachers."

347
00:22:21,856 --> 00:22:24,023
We don't even know
that's what he's got.

348
00:22:24,275 --> 00:22:28,445
You're right. Let's just be ignorant.
Why worry about anything now?

349
00:22:30,948 --> 00:22:32,282
You blame me, don't you?

350
00:22:32,492 --> 00:22:34,702
Who said anything about that?

351
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:36,745
No, go ahead. You blame me.

352
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:38,289
I blame myself.

353
00:22:38,498 --> 00:22:40,958
- For what?
- For what.

354
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:44,712
For staying with me?

355
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:46,755
I have two eyes.

356
00:22:50,343 --> 00:22:51,969
Who do we blame our daughter on?

357
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:57,183
Straight-A student, National Honor
Society, featured soloist in the choir.

358
00:22:57,477 --> 00:22:59,436
Yeah, this isn't going anywhere.

359
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:02,814
"Like father, like son," right?
What about "Daddy's little girl"?

360
00:23:05,026 --> 00:23:09,112
My son's got your Uncle Lenny in his
gene pool. Do I blame you for that?

361
00:23:09,405 --> 00:23:10,906
If it helps you.

362
00:23:25,797 --> 00:23:27,423
Hi, Grandma.

363
00:23:28,425 --> 00:23:30,760
Well, look who's here.

364
00:23:31,011 --> 00:23:33,721
- Oh, look at that little face.
- Ow.

365
00:23:35,432 --> 00:23:37,934
Pearl, meet my grandson.

366
00:23:38,143 --> 00:23:39,602
This is your grandson?

367
00:23:39,853 --> 00:23:43,231
He rode his bike all the way over
to visit his grandma.

368
00:23:43,441 --> 00:23:44,942
How do you like that?

369
00:23:45,151 --> 00:23:47,152
How come he's not in school?

370
00:23:47,445 --> 00:23:50,322
- Because he was a bad boy!
- Ow.

371
00:23:50,532 --> 00:23:52,824
Yes, he was, that's why.

372
00:23:53,076 --> 00:23:55,160
He's a big one!

373
00:23:59,165 --> 00:24:00,999
She had a stroke.

374
00:24:02,126 --> 00:24:04,628
Now half her brain is gone.

375
00:24:05,506 --> 00:24:09,425
So what shall we do?
What shall we do?

376
00:24:10,135 --> 00:24:11,386
Let's see.

377
00:24:12,263 --> 00:24:13,805
Let's play Scrabble.

378
00:24:14,014 --> 00:24:17,475
You'd be surprised how good
your grandmother is.

379
00:24:17,726 --> 00:24:20,311
I don't think so, Gram.
I'm kind of wiped.

380
00:24:20,604 --> 00:24:25,692
Oh, you're a 13-year-old boy.
You're too young to be so tired.

381
00:24:26,152 --> 00:24:30,322
They sent me to a psychiatrist
all morning. I took a million tests.

382
00:24:30,615 --> 00:24:32,157
A psychiatrist?

383
00:24:32,492 --> 00:24:35,202
You know, because I got
suspended and everything.

384
00:24:35,453 --> 00:24:38,872
They sent you to a psychiatrist?

385
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:40,666
Yeah.

386
00:24:40,834 --> 00:24:43,836
But that's crazy.
That's all nonsense.

387
00:24:44,754 --> 00:24:48,007
That's nothing but a racket
for the Jews!

388
00:24:48,843 --> 00:24:49,884
Dad goes.

389
00:24:50,136 --> 00:24:53,138
- He does not.
- Yes, he does.

390
00:24:53,347 --> 00:24:55,682
- He does not.
- Yes, he does.

391
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,851
To a psychiatrist?

392
00:24:58,144 --> 00:24:59,144
Yeah.

393
00:24:59,645 --> 00:25:01,229
He does not.

394
00:25:01,439 --> 00:25:02,689
He does too.

395
00:25:02,857 --> 00:25:05,191
Why do you say that?
That's ridiculous!

396
00:25:05,443 --> 00:25:07,861
I heard him and Mom talking about it.

397
00:25:08,195 --> 00:25:10,363
What does he need a psychiatrist for?

398
00:25:11,867 --> 00:25:14,368
Is it okay if I take
that pear, Grandma?

399
00:25:16,496 --> 00:25:20,625
He goes to talk about his mother.
That's what he's doing.

400
00:25:21,043 --> 00:25:24,003
He talks about me, he complains.

401
00:25:24,212 --> 00:25:27,798
"She didn't do this, she did that."

402
00:25:29,593 --> 00:25:34,388
Oh, I gave my life to my children
on a silver platter.

403
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:37,893
And this is how he repays me.

404
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,821
- Dad, what's that noise?
- Noise?

405
00:25:50,073 --> 00:25:51,490
It's a flat tire.

406
00:25:51,741 --> 00:25:54,242
I asked you to clean the nails
from the driveway.

407
00:25:56,622 --> 00:25:58,748
I was praying for something like this.

408
00:25:59,249 --> 00:26:01,959
I spent too much money on braces
for two years...

409
00:26:02,211 --> 00:26:04,337
...not to take you to the dentist now.

410
00:26:06,423 --> 00:26:08,424
Maybe we should call the Auto Club.

411
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:13,221
We change tires at our house.
Watch and learn.

412
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:21,646
Yesterday, with the psychologist,
how'd that go?

413
00:26:22,857 --> 00:26:24,274
Okay.

414
00:26:25,652 --> 00:26:27,361
Yeah? What'd you guys do?

415
00:26:27,612 --> 00:26:31,865
He made me look at pictures. And then
I had to say something about them.

416
00:26:32,117 --> 00:26:34,034
Did you talk about
anything interesting?

417
00:26:34,494 --> 00:26:37,162
That's kind of between
me and my therapist.

418
00:26:37,372 --> 00:26:40,124
He said I don't have to
say anything if I didn't want to.

419
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:43,001
That's what we pay extra for
at that school?

420
00:26:48,843 --> 00:26:51,886
The other night at dinner,
you made a remark.

421
00:26:52,888 --> 00:26:54,723
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you did.

422
00:26:54,974 --> 00:26:58,017
I'm not mad. I just need to know
what you meant by it.

423
00:26:59,186 --> 00:27:00,437
I didn't mean anything.

424
00:27:00,646 --> 00:27:02,230
Come on.

425
00:27:06,862 --> 00:27:08,654
Kids at school said some stuff.

426
00:27:08,989 --> 00:27:10,614
What'd they say?

427
00:27:10,824 --> 00:27:12,408
That you were in the Mafia.

428
00:27:13,952 --> 00:27:15,828
What do you think?

429
00:27:16,538 --> 00:27:17,663
I don't know.

430
00:27:17,873 --> 00:27:19,832
The guys at
Uncle Jackie's funeral.

431
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:23,544
And those other guys writing
license plates and taking pictures.

432
00:27:23,795 --> 00:27:26,255
Those were feds, right?
Like in Godfather I.

433
00:27:26,883 --> 00:27:30,218
Uncle Jackie's funeral. Right.

434
00:27:30,428 --> 00:27:32,888
I found this page with Uncle Jackie
on the Web.

435
00:27:33,181 --> 00:27:37,517
It said he ran some union that ripped
off these pension things or something.

436
00:27:39,312 --> 00:27:42,022
Uncle Jackie was a complicated man.

437
00:27:42,648 --> 00:27:44,065
But you loved him, right?

438
00:27:45,109 --> 00:27:46,401
Yeah.

439
00:27:46,861 --> 00:27:49,237
You didn't see me on the Web, did you?

440
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,032
No.

441
00:27:51,825 --> 00:27:53,242
That's right.

442
00:27:54,036 --> 00:27:57,413
Give me a hand so we can
get the algae scraped off your teeth.

443
00:28:00,209 --> 00:28:03,836
I'm going crazy with this shit,
what he knows, what he doesn't know.

444
00:28:04,546 --> 00:28:07,215
He'll find out eventually.
What's the difference?

445
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,387
Me, my father. It's probably
in the genes, right?

446
00:28:13,848 --> 00:28:15,933
You know, this ADD thing.

447
00:28:17,185 --> 00:28:18,477
It's probably genetical.

448
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:23,565
What about Pussy?

449
00:28:25,068 --> 00:28:26,819
He's an acquaintance of mine.

450
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:30,072
This guy is a stone gangster,
and he's got three kids.

451
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,282
One graduated,
and two are going to Villanova.

452
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,786
- How do you account for that?
- Then you got Leopold and Loeb.

453
00:28:35,996 --> 00:28:37,705
They murdered this kid for fun...

454
00:28:37,957 --> 00:28:40,583
...and their father was
a successful businessman.

455
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,420
Do you hold your father responsible
for what you've become?

456
00:28:45,047 --> 00:28:47,924
Sometimes I think about
what life would've been like...

457
00:28:48,217 --> 00:28:52,053
...if my father hadn't gotten mixed up
in what he got mixed up in.

458
00:28:52,513 --> 00:28:54,764
How life would've been different.

459
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:59,102
Maybe I'd be selling patio furniture
in San Diego.

460
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:02,648
We talked last time about
how you felt when you became aware...

461
00:29:02,858 --> 00:29:06,569
...of your father's criminal life.
Any more thoughts on that?

462
00:29:10,073 --> 00:29:13,659
When you first started therapy,
you said you had this dream...

463
00:29:13,869 --> 00:29:15,369
...about those ducks.

464
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:18,998
They flew away with your penis.
It was a bad omen...

465
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:23,461
...that something was going to happen
in your family.

466
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,380
Is this the terrible thing?

467
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:31,595
Look, if you know something, please,
quit fucking around.

468
00:29:31,846 --> 00:29:34,306
I think it's important to remember.

469
00:29:34,765 --> 00:29:37,434
You said you liked
the History Channel.

470
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:41,438
He who doesn't understand history
is doomed to repeat it.

471
00:29:42,983 --> 00:29:46,193
- Let's talk about your father.
- My father.

472
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,243
Heads up!

473
00:30:03,211 --> 00:30:04,587
Why are you smiling?

474
00:30:04,756 --> 00:30:06,715
Just thinking about my uncle.

475
00:30:07,634 --> 00:30:09,551
He used to throw the ball with me.

476
00:30:09,844 --> 00:30:12,095
The one with whom you have
all the static?

477
00:30:12,847 --> 00:30:13,847
Yeah.

478
00:30:14,057 --> 00:30:15,641
Uncle Jun.

479
00:30:16,517 --> 00:30:20,729
He was always practicing his curve ball
outside in front of the house.

480
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:25,400
I was probably about 8 or 9.

481
00:30:28,155 --> 00:30:29,614
Then my sister came out.

482
00:30:30,115 --> 00:30:32,492
The one who lives in California?

483
00:30:32,701 --> 00:30:34,035
Janice.

484
00:30:35,412 --> 00:30:38,122
How does she feel about your parents?

485
00:30:38,374 --> 00:30:41,292
Who cares what she thinks?
She calls herself Vishnamantha.

486
00:30:41,502 --> 00:30:44,420
Soprano isn't good enough for her.
Wannabe dot-head.

487
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,965
Why were you thinking of your uncle?

488
00:30:48,634 --> 00:30:49,676
I don't know.

489
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:51,178
What are you doing?

490
00:30:51,471 --> 00:30:53,222
I'm getting in the car.

491
00:30:53,473 --> 00:30:55,140
Why? Where are you going?

492
00:30:55,684 --> 00:30:57,059
Someplace.

493
00:30:59,396 --> 00:31:01,313
Where are you going?
Can I come?

494
00:31:01,606 --> 00:31:04,692
Your mom wants you to get
the screens down to the basement.

495
00:31:04,985 --> 00:31:07,403
No, I want to go with you guys.

496
00:31:07,654 --> 00:31:08,654
He said no.

497
00:31:08,905 --> 00:31:10,489
Janice...

498
00:31:10,782 --> 00:31:14,243
...you both won't be going,
you talk to your brother like that.

499
00:31:23,421 --> 00:31:24,671
Go on.

500
00:31:25,923 --> 00:31:30,677
My mother was inside, cooking the meat
for the gravy, you know, the "red lead."

501
00:31:30,928 --> 00:31:33,471
Pork bones and veal.
It was a Sunday.

502
00:31:33,681 --> 00:31:36,558
- But you said...
- I said we'd see.

503
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:39,103
What's the matter with her?
She won't eat.

504
00:31:39,271 --> 00:31:41,355
You won't have to get me anything
for Christmas.

505
00:31:41,523 --> 00:31:43,691
You won't have to tell me
to take the trash out.

506
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:46,110
I shouldn't have to tell you
to take the trash out.

507
00:31:46,445 --> 00:31:48,446
Why can't I have this?
It isn't fair!

508
00:31:48,655 --> 00:31:51,282
I don't want to hear about
that stupid electric organ!

509
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,034
It's not stupid, it's fun.

510
00:31:53,285 --> 00:31:55,703
Enough! He won't give me
a moment's peace.

511
00:31:55,912 --> 00:31:59,623
If Janice wanted it, she'd get it.
She always gets what she wants.

512
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:02,169
Where were they going?
Why couldn't I go?

513
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,296
Your sister does as she's told.

514
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,630
Right, I forgot.

515
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:08,800
Janice never does anything wrong.
She's just perfect.

516
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:11,053
You're driving me crazy!

517
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,430
No, I'm not.

518
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:15,015
She said what?

519
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,726
She was high-strung,
very dramatic.

520
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:20,062
Every night to her is
a night at the opera.

521
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:23,149
I could stick this fork in your eye!

522
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:26,069
She wasn't gonna do it.

523
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:29,781
Holy shit, that's why
I'm remembering all this.

524
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:33,242
- On account of where they were going.
- Where were they going?

525
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:35,953
I found out a couple Sundays later.

526
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:39,332
The toll now stands
at 11 dead and 600 wounded...

527
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,459
...as well as
hundreds of businesses...

528
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,920
Mom, I'm going to
the CYO to play ball.

529
00:32:44,172 --> 00:32:47,883
Take a bat with you, what they're
doing on Springfield Avenue.

530
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:51,345
Looting and sniper fire
along Springfield Avenue continue...

531
00:32:51,513 --> 00:32:55,474
...with Mayor Hugh Addonizio placing
blame on outside agitators...

532
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,211
Come on, Dad, let's go!

533
00:33:23,462 --> 00:33:25,880
I'm coming, I'm coming.

534
00:33:27,216 --> 00:33:31,302
Keep your sticky fingers off the car.
I just waxed the damn thing.

535
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,644
Can I steer?

536
00:33:39,312 --> 00:33:41,230
Maybe on the way home, honey.

537
00:33:54,704 --> 00:33:56,538
Here we are.

538
00:34:06,465 --> 00:34:07,716
Come on.

539
00:34:43,463 --> 00:34:44,755
Uncle Jun?

540
00:34:46,674 --> 00:34:48,425
Buy something nice.

541
00:34:58,687 --> 00:35:00,647
My heart was broken.

542
00:35:00,981 --> 00:35:03,983
You felt your father was
showing favoritism.

543
00:35:04,193 --> 00:35:07,111
I still remember that feeling
in the pit of my stomach.

544
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:09,155
Did you confront them?

545
00:35:09,365 --> 00:35:13,785
Have you been listening to me?
Kids don't confront in my family.

546
00:35:13,994 --> 00:35:17,121
How does this pertain to
the situation with your son?

547
00:35:17,331 --> 00:35:22,252
This amusement park is where I found
out my father wasn't like other fathers.

548
00:35:22,545 --> 00:35:24,922
I took the bus this time.

549
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:28,259
It was three transfers from Newark.

550
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:32,680
I had this candy bar in my pocket.

551
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:35,557
It had sand or lint
or something on it.

552
00:35:43,484 --> 00:35:45,568
What you doing?
Where you spitting?

553
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,195
I ain't doing nothing!

554
00:35:47,488 --> 00:35:49,531
You threw that wrapper on the floor.

555
00:35:49,782 --> 00:35:51,616
- Pick it up!
- Leave me alone!

556
00:35:51,909 --> 00:35:53,535
Come back! Pick it up!

557
00:36:00,668 --> 00:36:02,085
What in the world?

558
00:36:07,384 --> 00:36:09,135
Stop or I'll shoot!

559
00:36:09,428 --> 00:36:11,095
You're under arrest!

560
00:36:12,556 --> 00:36:13,639
Stop!

561
00:36:17,644 --> 00:36:19,228
You're under arrest.

562
00:36:20,063 --> 00:36:21,105
My leg!

563
00:36:21,398 --> 00:36:24,734
Name was Cicchi Sasso, my
father's cousin on his mother's side.

564
00:36:25,068 --> 00:36:28,487
Got out of Vietnam on account
of cops blew his kneecap off.

565
00:36:33,745 --> 00:36:35,620
What's the matter with you cops?

566
00:36:35,872 --> 00:36:38,915
Can't bring your kid to
an amusement park no more?

567
00:36:39,208 --> 00:36:40,625
Daddy! Daddy!

568
00:36:40,877 --> 00:36:42,711
It's okay, baby. It's okay.

569
00:36:43,004 --> 00:36:45,172
You go home to Mommy, sweetheart.

570
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:48,925
Va fangool, why don't you go
lock up the melanzane?

571
00:36:49,218 --> 00:36:50,886
They're burning down Newark.

572
00:37:01,648 --> 00:37:04,275
I want my lawyer.
I'm not saying shit to you.

573
00:37:04,443 --> 00:37:06,611
That's Johnny-boy Soprano!

574
00:37:10,824 --> 00:37:13,368
Asshole, you're hurting my wrist.

575
00:37:16,623 --> 00:37:19,708
Get the fuck in there, Clarabell.

576
00:37:22,087 --> 00:37:25,214
He used Janice as a front.
They brought their daughters...

577
00:37:25,465 --> 00:37:28,133
...so that their business
looked sweet and innocent.

578
00:37:28,385 --> 00:37:29,968
That must've been devastating.

579
00:37:30,428 --> 00:37:32,304
It turned out it was no big deal.

580
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:35,808
To see your father handcuffed
and led away by the police?

581
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:39,729
Well, at the time I thought
my head was gonna explode.

582
00:37:40,648 --> 00:37:42,982
He looked helpless.

583
00:37:44,652 --> 00:37:48,196
But when I got home, my mother
had a different perspective.

584
00:37:48,447 --> 00:37:50,073
Which made me feel better.

585
00:37:50,324 --> 00:37:52,867
So in her pain,
she reached out to you.

586
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,285
That's one way to put it.

587
00:37:54,829 --> 00:37:58,081
Your father may not be home
for dinner. Go wash up.

588
00:37:58,332 --> 00:38:00,583
- I know.
- What do you know?

589
00:38:00,836 --> 00:38:03,671
I saw him getting arrested.
What did he do?

590
00:38:03,964 --> 00:38:06,715
He didn't do anything!
They just pick on Italians.

591
00:38:06,925 --> 00:38:10,928
Still, in my heart, I knew
my father was no freedom fighter.

592
00:38:11,179 --> 00:38:13,139
So he went to jail?

593
00:38:13,348 --> 00:38:14,849
He came home in a couple hours.

594
00:38:15,684 --> 00:38:17,852
We were watching Ed Sullivan.

595
00:38:28,364 --> 00:38:30,365
Hey! Livia!

596
00:38:30,616 --> 00:38:32,200
Look who's home.

597
00:38:33,369 --> 00:38:35,203
- What happened?
- What happened?

598
00:38:35,371 --> 00:38:37,539
I got you cherry vanilla
at Nasto's.

599
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:41,668
That didn't take long.
Must be in good with the uppity-ups.

600
00:38:43,045 --> 00:38:44,379
Let this be a lesson.

601
00:38:44,673 --> 00:38:47,508
Those stupid cops,
they went to the wrong place.

602
00:38:47,718 --> 00:38:49,760
Arrested the wrong guys.

603
00:38:50,053 --> 00:38:52,096
How's my little girl?
You all right?

604
00:38:52,389 --> 00:38:54,056
- I'm okay.
- Good.

605
00:38:54,349 --> 00:38:57,393
Johnny-boy! Hey, Johnny-boy!

606
00:38:57,895 --> 00:38:59,395
Good for you, Johnny.

607
00:38:59,646 --> 00:39:01,856
Show those fucking sons of bitches.

608
00:39:02,107 --> 00:39:03,399
What's up, Rocco?

609
00:39:06,988 --> 00:39:08,280
So...

610
00:39:09,282 --> 00:39:10,574
...everything okay?

611
00:39:10,783 --> 00:39:13,535
I don't understand.
The man your father beat up...

612
00:39:13,786 --> 00:39:16,246
...was the same one
congratulating him?

613
00:39:16,706 --> 00:39:18,081
Yeah. One of them.

614
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:20,334
Rocco Allatore.

615
00:39:22,045 --> 00:39:23,337
Why'd they arrest him?

616
00:39:23,588 --> 00:39:26,006
He was in violation of his parole.

617
00:39:26,341 --> 00:39:29,343
Association with known undesirables.

618
00:39:29,595 --> 00:39:32,013
But nothing ever happened.
It just went away.

619
00:39:32,348 --> 00:39:34,015
He'd been in prison?

620
00:39:34,225 --> 00:39:35,808
He was away when I was a kid...

621
00:39:36,018 --> 00:39:39,062
...but they told me he was
in Montana being a cowboy.

622
00:39:44,068 --> 00:39:45,151
What?

623
00:39:50,157 --> 00:39:51,699
My son is doomed, right?

624
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,619
Why do you say that?

625
00:39:54,162 --> 00:39:57,081
This is the part where
I'm supposed to tell you...

626
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:00,334
...how terrible my father was
and the terrible things he did...

627
00:40:00,585 --> 00:40:02,920
...and how he ruined my life.

628
00:40:03,755 --> 00:40:06,715
But I'll tell you, I was proud
to be Johnny Soprano's kid.

629
00:40:06,967 --> 00:40:09,093
When he beat the shit
out of that guy...

630
00:40:09,344 --> 00:40:11,762
...I told the class
how tough my father was.

631
00:40:11,972 --> 00:40:14,139
Is that how your son feels about you?

632
00:40:14,475 --> 00:40:15,475
Yeah, probably.

633
00:40:15,768 --> 00:40:18,186
And I'm glad.
I'm glad if he's proud of me.

634
00:40:18,479 --> 00:40:21,773
But that's the bind I'm in.
I don't want him to be like me.

635
00:40:22,567 --> 00:40:23,984
He could be anything he wants.

636
00:40:24,193 --> 00:40:25,944
He could be like a guy
I knew in school.

637
00:40:26,153 --> 00:40:28,655
His grandfather invented
ties for the end of salamis.

638
00:40:28,864 --> 00:40:32,158
He made millions of dollars.
He's sitting on his ass.

639
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,620
Have you communicated this
to your son?

640
00:40:36,163 --> 00:40:38,206
Not in so many words.

641
00:40:41,211 --> 00:40:43,004
Probably not at all.

642
00:40:44,506 --> 00:40:46,632
What's the difference?
You said it.

643
00:40:46,883 --> 00:40:49,510
It's in the blood. It's hereditary.

644
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:53,514
Genetic predispositions are only that.
Predispositions.

645
00:40:53,682 --> 00:40:57,727
It's not a destiny written in stone.
People have choices.

646
00:40:58,395 --> 00:41:00,187
She finally offers an opinion.

647
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,693
Well, they do. You think everything
that happens is preordained?

648
00:41:04,944 --> 00:41:08,447
You don't think that human beings
possess free will?

649
00:41:08,656 --> 00:41:11,742
How come I'm not making
fucking pots in Peru?

650
00:41:12,493 --> 00:41:16,121
You're born to this shit.
You are what you are.

651
00:41:16,331 --> 00:41:19,124
Within that there's
a range of choices.

652
00:41:19,334 --> 00:41:20,709
This is America.

653
00:41:21,461 --> 00:41:23,795
Right. America.

654
00:41:25,132 --> 00:41:27,592
So, Livia, what do you think, huh?

655
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:30,219
Okies and misfits,
that's who goes there.

656
00:41:30,512 --> 00:41:32,597
Losers, the Beverly Hillbillies.

657
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:35,016
So now Rocco Allatore's a loser?

658
00:41:35,225 --> 00:41:39,520
I've had to rough Rocco up because of
money, but he's got a fucking brain.

659
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:40,980
He's opening a new book.

660
00:41:41,231 --> 00:41:43,900
After that gets up,
we get a little cash flow...

661
00:41:44,151 --> 00:41:46,611
Oh, Mr. Cash Flow!
Big businessman now.

662
00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:49,823
What do you know?
You're scared of your own shadow.

663
00:41:50,116 --> 00:41:52,826
Reno is growing by
leaps and bounds, Livia.

664
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,746
It's a chance to get in
on the ground floor.

665
00:41:55,955 --> 00:41:58,916
After Rocco gets the book up,
he'll open a supper club.

666
00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:02,836
- He wants me to run it.
- A supper club? Are you drunk?

667
00:42:03,713 --> 00:42:05,297
Jesus Christ Almighty!

668
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,549
Fucking albacore around my neck!

669
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,470
Every time I try...
Me and the kids'll go without you!

670
00:42:10,763 --> 00:42:13,181
They are not going anywhere!

671
00:42:13,432 --> 00:42:17,185
I'd rather smother them with a pillow
than take them to Nevada!

672
00:42:17,478 --> 00:42:20,313
Always with the drama!

673
00:42:26,696 --> 00:42:28,488
Livia, here you are.

674
00:42:28,698 --> 00:42:31,116
Junior, you scared me to death.

675
00:42:31,326 --> 00:42:34,328
I can't stay, but I didn't want
to let another day go by.

676
00:42:34,538 --> 00:42:36,330
Business headaches
like you won't believe.

677
00:42:36,581 --> 00:42:40,876
Oh, yeah, you and the other one.
With all your headaches.

678
00:42:41,128 --> 00:42:42,586
Who, Tony?

679
00:42:43,171 --> 00:42:44,588
Don't be so hard on him.

680
00:42:44,881 --> 00:42:47,800
He's got a lot to learn, but he's
headed in the right direction.

681
00:42:48,093 --> 00:42:51,637
Where to?
Overbrook State Mental Hospital?

682
00:42:51,805 --> 00:42:52,805
What?

683
00:42:54,308 --> 00:42:56,143
Hey, Uncle Jun. How you doing?

684
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:02,482
He's keeping his hair.

685
00:43:02,942 --> 00:43:06,069
You see, what a good boy,
he comes to visit his mother.

686
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:13,660
My son's staying for dinner, Junior.
I don't suppose you have time.

687
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:15,871
You two want to visit each other.

688
00:43:16,081 --> 00:43:20,126
Junior's very busy these days
with his headaches.

689
00:43:20,377 --> 00:43:23,254
Not too busy to shoot the shit
with you, Tony.

690
00:43:23,505 --> 00:43:25,006
We gotta catch a ball game.

691
00:43:25,257 --> 00:43:27,675
Hey, you got my number. All right.

692
00:43:28,844 --> 00:43:30,261
That man.

693
00:43:30,596 --> 00:43:33,681
He's so full of himself
since becoming caporegime.

694
00:43:33,932 --> 00:43:35,475
He makes me sick.

695
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:43,817
Remember the Allatores, Ma?

696
00:43:44,068 --> 00:43:45,486
Oh, why wouldn't I?

697
00:43:45,737 --> 00:43:48,697
They moved to Nevada.
They're billionaires now.

698
00:43:48,948 --> 00:43:52,576
Oh, that Rocco Allatore,
he was a real go-getter.

699
00:43:52,827 --> 00:43:56,288
- Didn't Dad want to go with him?
- Your father? No.

700
00:43:56,956 --> 00:44:01,043
Yeah, he did.
I remember you guys talking about it.

701
00:44:01,212 --> 00:44:04,214
Allatore would start a business,
Dad would do it with him.

702
00:44:04,423 --> 00:44:06,883
Rocco just got him all worked up,
that's all.

703
00:44:07,051 --> 00:44:09,552
What is this with all
these questions?

704
00:44:09,887 --> 00:44:11,679
Dad wanted to go with him.

705
00:44:11,889 --> 00:44:12,972
You wouldn't let him.

706
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:15,225
Let him?

707
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:16,976
What do you mean?

708
00:44:17,228 --> 00:44:21,231
You just tell me one time
your father didn't do...

709
00:44:21,482 --> 00:44:23,942
...exactly as he wanted.

710
00:44:24,694 --> 00:44:28,781
I don't know. Maybe this was
his chance to get out.

711
00:44:29,074 --> 00:44:32,910
Dad was no choirboy, but maybe
with a little bit of support...

712
00:44:33,078 --> 00:44:35,329
Mr. Sensitive now.

713
00:44:35,914 --> 00:44:39,917
Well, if it bothers you, maybe
you better talk to a psychiatrist.

714
00:44:44,589 --> 00:44:47,007
What are you talking about,
a psychiatrist?

715
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,305
That's what people do when they want
somebody to blame for their life.

716
00:44:52,598 --> 00:44:54,724
You're a real stone player,
aren't you?

717
00:44:54,934 --> 00:44:57,310
You threatened to smother
his children.

718
00:44:57,770 --> 00:44:59,312
What does that mean?

719
00:44:59,605 --> 00:45:02,649
Everybody thought Dad was ruthless,
but I gotta hand it to you.

720
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,235
If you'd been born
after those feminists...

721
00:45:05,486 --> 00:45:07,571
...you would've been
the real gangster.

722
00:45:09,324 --> 00:45:12,326
I don't know what
you're talking about!

723
00:45:20,377 --> 00:45:21,377
Please, sit.

724
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:25,548
I know you're probably eager to hear
the results of our testing.

725
00:45:25,841 --> 00:45:29,302
- How's Anthony doing?
- Good, I think. Don't you think so?

726
00:45:29,511 --> 00:45:30,928
Yeah, I think so.

727
00:45:31,097 --> 00:45:32,097
Okay.

728
00:45:32,265 --> 00:45:34,141
Well, good.

729
00:45:35,351 --> 00:45:36,810
Let's get to it.

730
00:45:37,562 --> 00:45:40,731
The good news is, no evidence
of learning disability.

731
00:45:42,525 --> 00:45:45,819
Cognitive function, verbal
and nonverbal intelligent testing...

732
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:48,280
...arithmetic and reading
evaluation...

733
00:45:48,531 --> 00:45:50,616
- ...all within normal range.
- Thank goodness.

734
00:45:50,867 --> 00:45:52,868
Got a clean bill of health.

735
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,955
No soft sign on
the neurological, either.

736
00:45:56,165 --> 00:45:59,876
That's all the good news.
Why don't you tell us the bad news?

737
00:46:00,336 --> 00:46:04,339
Well, as to whether
Anthony has ADD...

738
00:46:04,965 --> 00:46:07,342
...the results were interesting.

739
00:46:07,843 --> 00:46:11,971
The APA Standard is for the subject
to manifest six out of nine...

740
00:46:12,222 --> 00:46:14,515
...possible symptoms of ADD.

741
00:46:14,683 --> 00:46:18,436
In testing, Anthony manifested
five of those symptoms.

742
00:46:18,688 --> 00:46:20,147
Five, really?

743
00:46:20,357 --> 00:46:23,442
He often has difficulty
awaiting his turn...

744
00:46:23,693 --> 00:46:28,072
...is often quote-unquote "on the go,"
or acts as if driven by a motor...

745
00:46:28,365 --> 00:46:30,991
...often interrupts or intrudes
on others...

746
00:46:31,242 --> 00:46:33,869
...and often fidgets
with hands or feet.

747
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,372
He fidgets with hands or feet?

748
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:38,540
That's right.

749
00:46:41,045 --> 00:46:42,712
You mean, like, he fidgets.

750
00:46:43,714 --> 00:46:44,965
Uh-huh.

751
00:46:45,967 --> 00:46:48,259
And that's a sickness, to fidget?

752
00:46:48,469 --> 00:46:51,554
Mr. Soprano, it's one of nine
possible symptoms.

753
00:46:54,141 --> 00:46:56,017
What constitutes a fidget?

754
00:46:57,895 --> 00:46:58,895
Tony...

755
00:46:59,063 --> 00:47:01,106
No, no, what constitutes a fidget?

756
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:05,069
So what if he fidgets?
Who doesn't fidget in school?

757
00:47:05,487 --> 00:47:09,240
The kid's in puberty.
He gets a hard-on every 10 minutes.

758
00:47:09,449 --> 00:47:11,492
Anthony is a borderline case.

759
00:47:11,743 --> 00:47:14,120
He's not a case,
he's a 13-year-old boy.

760
00:47:14,371 --> 00:47:17,707
Every time you see a problem,
you turn it into a disease.

761
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:20,668
He's a kid who made a mistake,
and he'll pay for it.

762
00:47:20,877 --> 00:47:23,462
But he's gonna be fine. Come on.

763
00:47:28,094 --> 00:47:29,469
I think he's right.

764
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:32,973
And I don't think we should have to
pay for this testing.

765
00:47:37,645 --> 00:47:41,273
To oppose this
massive force bearing down on Midway...

766
00:47:41,524 --> 00:47:45,777
...Admiral Nimitz had no battleships
in shape for the fight.

767
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:48,322
However, he had the carriers...

768
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:51,325
...Yorktown, Enterprise and Hornet.

769
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:55,955
This might prove to be the trump card.

770
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:24,485
Studying?

771
00:48:25,153 --> 00:48:26,528
Government.

772
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:31,325
It's not the end of the world, Anth.

773
00:48:32,036 --> 00:48:33,661
I'm depressed.

774
00:48:35,164 --> 00:48:36,790
You're not depressed.

775
00:48:37,041 --> 00:48:40,335
You're sad because you did
something stupid, and you got grounded.

776
00:48:40,586 --> 00:48:43,755
You can't watch TV or play on your
computer for a couple weeks.

777
00:48:44,048 --> 00:48:45,757
It's gonna stay like that.

778
00:48:47,259 --> 00:48:48,885
It isn't fair.

779
00:48:50,012 --> 00:48:51,554
You got that right.

780
00:49:03,693 --> 00:49:05,069
What are you doing?

781
00:49:05,362 --> 00:49:06,946
What's it look like?

782
00:49:09,407 --> 00:49:10,866
Can I have one too?

783
00:49:11,409 --> 00:49:13,035
This one's yours.

784
00:49:14,704 --> 00:49:16,539
Gonna need sprinkles.

785
00:49:19,293 --> 00:49:20,710
Okay.

786
00:49:21,379 --> 00:49:22,629
You want nuts?

787
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,132
Yeah. M&M's?

788
00:49:50,075 --> 00:49:51,367
Pretty good.


1
00:01:50,663 --> 00:01:53,290
In the Czech Republic too,
we love pork.

2
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:56,168
Ever had our sausages?

3
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,886
In the Czech Republic too,
we love pork.

4
00:02:05,095 --> 00:02:07,805
You ever had our sausages?

5
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,329
Adriana?

6
00:02:30,665 --> 00:02:34,292
In the Czech Republic too,
we love pork. Ever had our sausages?

7
00:02:38,673 --> 00:02:40,548
Emil Kolar?

8
00:02:42,176 --> 00:02:46,012
- Help you?
- Salami sub, hold the mayo.

9
00:02:46,265 --> 00:02:48,057
We're out of mayo.

10
00:02:51,687 --> 00:02:54,105
Change my meat to black forest.

11
00:03:04,242 --> 00:03:05,534
You killed me.

12
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,286
What do you want me to do?

13
00:03:07,537 --> 00:03:08,620
I want to tell you.

14
00:03:08,871 --> 00:03:10,789
What?
You come here every night.

15
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:12,541
You fucked up.

16
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,668
What do you mean?

17
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,254
Here's these.

18
00:03:18,007 --> 00:03:19,299
Where'd you find them?

19
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,552
One in the table. Three in my skull.

20
00:03:25,222 --> 00:03:27,682
You will have our sausages.

21
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:29,475
Get rid of these.

22
00:03:31,353 --> 00:03:33,062
Let go of me! Let go!

23
00:03:44,743 --> 00:03:47,369
- I would've wrapped it...
- That's okay. A computer!

24
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,873
This one got such a good write-up,
I got one for myself.

25
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:54,169
- Let's move on, okay?
- Congratulations. God bless.

26
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:02,427
You look gorgeous.
Who's your date?

27
00:04:02,595 --> 00:04:04,512
What do you mean, "Who's your date?"

28
00:04:04,764 --> 00:04:06,806
- Good to see you.
- Congratulations.

29
00:04:07,059 --> 00:04:10,102
- Thank you.
- Melissa was beautiful up there.

30
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,813
Oh, Mama Livia, come stai, darling?

31
00:04:13,065 --> 00:04:15,733
Listen to him,
with that "my darling."

32
00:04:15,942 --> 00:04:18,319
I am nobody's darling.

33
00:04:18,612 --> 00:04:20,529
She never disappoints you.

34
00:04:20,781 --> 00:04:23,449
Are you still seeing your
other women, Lorenzo?

35
00:04:23,743 --> 00:04:26,328
Come on, Ma, let's mingle.

36
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:29,289
Sorry, the older she gets,
the worse she gets.

37
00:04:29,624 --> 00:04:33,293
I heard disturbing shit last night.
I wanted to talk to you.

38
00:04:33,544 --> 00:04:37,130
But with the rehearsal dinner
and everything, you know...

39
00:04:37,341 --> 00:04:39,675
There's the priest.
I'll be right back.

40
00:04:46,934 --> 00:04:48,267
Yeah!

41
00:04:53,483 --> 00:04:56,860
Federal indictments?
Where the fuck did you get this?

42
00:04:57,112 --> 00:05:02,157
I got a guy, his goomar works at FBI
headquarters as a word processor.

43
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,826
When's it coming down?

44
00:05:04,077 --> 00:05:06,829
I don't know. When she knows,
she'll tell me.

45
00:05:07,247 --> 00:05:09,456
- Indictments? What the fuck?
- You sure?

46
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:14,129
It ain't just my source in Jersey. Half
of New York moved to Fort Lauderdale.

47
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,798
Fuck! They're gonna want my ass.

48
00:05:17,007 --> 00:05:18,383
Why?

49
00:05:18,634 --> 00:05:20,718
What do you mean, why? I'm O.C.

50
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:22,804
When'd you get your wings?

51
00:05:23,013 --> 00:05:26,933
I didn't. Not yet, anyway.

52
00:05:27,853 --> 00:05:30,271
Uncle Junior, you got anything to say?

53
00:05:30,522 --> 00:05:33,649
You guys see indictments
under your bed at night.

54
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,820
You're ready to lam it. As far as
I'm concerned, it's speculation.

55
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,196
It's rumor.

56
00:05:39,448 --> 00:05:42,825
Better be safe than sorry.
I say we duck for a while.

57
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:46,163
What're we gonna do,
close shop? We can't do that.

58
00:05:46,414 --> 00:05:48,165
Tony, what do you think?

59
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:53,545
What the fuck are you asking him for?
I just gave you the answer.

60
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,841
He's right, we go, it's open season.
Albanians will be living in our houses.

61
00:05:58,051 --> 00:06:01,053
I just gave a G-note
to Larry Boy's kid for the boost.

62
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:04,390
If I have to lam in a hurry,
I'd have duped her another time.

63
00:06:12,817 --> 00:06:16,904
I gotta go. It's an emergency.
Say goodbye to your father for me.

64
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:23,577
I agree with my uncle.
He calls the shots, we do it.

65
00:06:23,786 --> 00:06:26,580
Well, maybe for today,
for right now...

66
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:30,709
...you were thinking that everybody
should do spring cleaning?

67
00:06:31,212 --> 00:06:32,712
That was my next comment.

68
00:07:08,251 --> 00:07:10,460
Think they'll come over the weekend?

69
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,796
They're coming someday.

70
00:07:18,053 --> 00:07:20,304
- Where's the rest of the money?
- Everywhere.

71
00:07:20,597 --> 00:07:21,931
Get it.

72
00:07:24,935 --> 00:07:27,979
- What else?
- How about your phone numbers?

73
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,898
Anybody who's anybody's in my head.

74
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,951
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Just, here we go.

75
00:07:41,202 --> 00:07:42,619
Here.

76
00:07:44,706 --> 00:07:48,333
Why now? Why the fuck now,
just when things were going good?

77
00:07:56,885 --> 00:08:00,096
- Boot your computer, cops are coming.
- So?

78
00:08:00,264 --> 00:08:03,057
You want them to see
that porno you downloaded?

79
00:08:12,861 --> 00:08:14,612
Better give me your jewelry.

80
00:08:15,447 --> 00:08:17,406
Oh, Jesus!

81
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:21,201
We can't produce receipts.
You want them stealing it?

82
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,083
Come on.

83
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,253
Not my engagement ring.
This isn't stolen.

84
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:33,089
Is it?

85
00:08:33,382 --> 00:08:34,841
No.

86
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:36,886
What do you think I am?

87
00:08:38,722 --> 00:08:40,848
Come on, give me that!

88
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,295
Adriana!

89
00:09:11,048 --> 00:09:13,883
It ate my whole script now!

90
00:09:17,888 --> 00:09:20,390
You're still on the file.
You deleted the text.

91
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:23,101
The fuck... Whatever.
You fucking asshole!

92
00:09:23,395 --> 00:09:26,271
Stop with the hysteria,
would you please?

93
00:09:26,481 --> 00:09:31,026
If you're gonna keep behaving
like a baby, I'm not gonna help you.

94
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:32,319
I mean it.

95
00:09:32,487 --> 00:09:35,656
At least you work that
squirrel program in the restaurant.

96
00:09:38,285 --> 00:09:40,995
There, the text came back.

97
00:09:41,288 --> 00:09:44,624
- You put it in buffer memory.
- What do you think?

98
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,501
Of the script?

99
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:50,672
Babe, I can't give an opinion
every time you add a sentence.

100
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,341
I gotta have the whole story flow.

101
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,510
I'm starting with the dialogue.

102
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,649
"I manuged to get the drop on him"?

103
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,736
Do you mean, "I managed
to get the drop on him"?

104
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:15,949
Or is he saying "manuge,"
like mannuggia l'americano?

105
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:27,169
My Tennessee William.

106
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,050
Where you going?

107
00:10:34,178 --> 00:10:36,179
Get over here.

108
00:10:37,723 --> 00:10:40,725
I have never seen you
apply yourself like this.

109
00:10:40,976 --> 00:10:43,936
I love movies. You know that.

110
00:10:44,481 --> 00:10:46,356
That smell in Blockbuster...

111
00:10:46,608 --> 00:10:50,194
...that candy and carpet smell,
I get high off it.

112
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:53,530
Gonna let all this love
and knowledge go to waste?

113
00:10:54,491 --> 00:10:57,951
My cousin Gregory's girlfriend, Amy,
who works for Tarantino, said:

114
00:10:58,162 --> 00:11:02,499
"Mob stories are always hot."
I can make my mark.

115
00:11:04,084 --> 00:11:09,130
With these indictments, shouldn't
you put the script away for a while...

116
00:11:09,632 --> 00:11:11,424
...and get rid of evidence?

117
00:11:13,052 --> 00:11:15,553
Travel light. Free bird.

118
00:11:16,056 --> 00:11:19,725
You stole this computer, plus
the one you just gave Melissa.

119
00:11:24,272 --> 00:11:25,314
I'm writing.

120
00:11:25,565 --> 00:11:26,774
Turn on channel 6.

121
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:28,901
Turn on channel 6.

122
00:11:32,073 --> 00:11:35,742
New Jersey Attorney General,
James Ricci, stated at a fundraiser...

123
00:11:35,952 --> 00:11:39,079
...that a grand jury has been
empaneled to investigate...

124
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:43,583
...possible Mob activities in the
Garden State with indictments to follow.

125
00:11:43,793 --> 00:11:47,337
With us is syndicated columnist
and author of Mafia:

126
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:50,466
America's Longest-Running
Soap Opera, Jeffrey Wernick.

127
00:11:50,717 --> 00:11:52,927
- Welcome.
- Pleasure to be here.

128
00:11:53,178 --> 00:11:57,139
For years, FBI has been telling us
that the Mafia is all but dead.

129
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:58,599
Let me interject.

130
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:03,771
While it is true that the Mob is
getting a standing eight-count...

131
00:12:04,065 --> 00:12:07,651
...I wouldn't call the fight.
The government knows this best.

132
00:12:07,902 --> 00:12:12,531
Murder, truck hijacking and money
laundering are expected inquiries.

133
00:12:12,782 --> 00:12:15,117
Do we know names of those
who'll be indicted?

134
00:12:15,451 --> 00:12:18,287
The indictments are sealed,
but with the recent death...

135
00:12:18,497 --> 00:12:21,124
...of acting Di Meo family boss,
Jackie Aprile...

136
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:25,086
...my sources tell me that
Corrado "Junior" Soprano...

137
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:28,590
...was made new boss
after the death of Aprile.

138
00:12:28,924 --> 00:12:32,886
The Sopranos have long, historic
ties to the New York families.

139
00:12:33,138 --> 00:12:35,472
What about possible
murder charges?

140
00:12:35,682 --> 00:12:39,268
They will undoubtedly be
focused on the as yet unsolved...

141
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,772
...execution-style slaying of Soprano
family associate, Brendan Filone.

142
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,985
- Was it part of a power struggle?
- Interesting.

143
00:12:48,194 --> 00:12:50,863
No one would have ranked him
as associate!

144
00:12:51,115 --> 00:12:53,575
A loyal soldier,
and he winds up dead...

145
00:12:53,868 --> 00:12:55,410
Soldier?

146
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,830
Brendan Filone? Associate?
Soldier? Fuck you!

147
00:12:59,081 --> 00:13:00,457
Jesus!

148
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:13,137
Did you see it from the beginning?
Did they mention my name?

149
00:13:14,723 --> 00:13:18,351
Stop the fucking chitchat, all right?
I gotta go.

150
00:13:23,316 --> 00:13:25,943
Nobody makes guinso gravy
like you, Nana.

151
00:13:26,194 --> 00:13:29,655
You know, I'm up at Bard
waiting for my care package.

152
00:13:29,864 --> 00:13:31,531
I don't like that word, Jason.

153
00:13:31,783 --> 00:13:32,866
What, guinso?

154
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:36,161
- The word is offensive!
- She's right, Jason.

155
00:13:36,372 --> 00:13:38,790
Sorry, Nana. What's it mean?

156
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,042
- It's from guinea.
- What's that?

157
00:13:41,335 --> 00:13:43,169
It's a derogation.

158
00:13:43,712 --> 00:13:47,048
I have a patient.
You wouldn't say guinea to him.

159
00:13:47,257 --> 00:13:51,511
Italian male seeing a shrink.
Let me guess: mother issues.

160
00:13:51,762 --> 00:13:53,721
- Why wouldn't you?
- Just wouldn't.

161
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:56,225
You'd be scared?
Is he in the Mafia?

162
00:13:56,476 --> 00:14:00,396
No, I shouldn't have mentioned
it! Can we change the subject?

163
00:14:00,647 --> 00:14:03,649
No way. Mom, is he
in the Mob, or what?

164
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,734
He's not a mobster, is he?

165
00:14:05,902 --> 00:14:09,905
Nobody knows better than you, Richard.
I can't discuss my patients.

166
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:13,868
I just hope he's not one of those
crumbs on the news.

167
00:14:14,578 --> 00:14:18,665
Just refer him to another doctor.
You can do that, couldn't you?

168
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,625
Grate the cheese, Dad.

169
00:14:21,252 --> 00:14:22,627
Sure she can.

170
00:14:23,922 --> 00:14:26,382
That might be what
you would do, Richard.

171
00:14:26,591 --> 00:14:28,926
Now I remember why we got divorced.

172
00:14:29,594 --> 00:14:32,471
Why refer him to another doctor?
He's my patient.

173
00:14:32,764 --> 00:14:36,475
You can't treat sociopaths. You
shouldn't help scum with bed-wetting.

174
00:14:36,768 --> 00:14:40,187
You have no idea who this man is,
and yet you call him scum.

175
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,942
People like him are the reason
Italian-Americans have a bad image.

176
00:14:44,193 --> 00:14:45,193
I agree.

177
00:14:45,361 --> 00:14:49,281
Ask anyone to describe an
Italian-American in this country...

178
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:53,910
...invariably he's gonna reference
The Godfather, GoodFellas...

179
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,328
Good movies.

180
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:59,500
- ...and the rest will mention pizza.
- Good movies to eat pizza by.

181
00:14:59,793 --> 00:15:03,046
Stop it, Jason!
I never said he was in the Mafia.

182
00:15:03,422 --> 00:15:05,339
We'll never see an Italian president.

183
00:15:05,549 --> 00:15:07,550
And that's my patient's fault?

184
00:15:08,218 --> 00:15:11,679
I realize that you're involved
in the Anti-Defamation lobby.

185
00:15:11,931 --> 00:15:16,769
So go after Hollywood if you feel
you must. But leave my patient alone.

186
00:15:16,978 --> 00:15:17,978
It's a synergy.

187
00:15:18,229 --> 00:15:22,024
News items and the portrayal
of Italian-Americans as gangsters!

188
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:27,362
Wasn't the Italian Anti-Def deal
started by Joe Colombo? A mobster?

189
00:15:27,573 --> 00:15:30,241
Italians Against Discrimination
did a study.

190
00:15:30,493 --> 00:15:33,787
In its height, the Mafia in the U.S.
had less than 5000 members.

191
00:15:33,996 --> 00:15:36,956
And yet, that tiny,
insignificant fraction...

192
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:41,336
...casts such a dark shadow over
20 million hard-working Americans.

193
00:15:41,545 --> 00:15:46,132
At this point in our cultural history,
Mob movies are classic American cinema.

194
00:15:46,343 --> 00:15:47,343
Like Westerns.

195
00:15:47,803 --> 00:15:49,470
I have to agree there, Rich.

196
00:15:49,721 --> 00:15:52,723
You never saw the Scotch-Irish
pissing and moaning...

197
00:15:52,974 --> 00:15:56,268
...about being portrayed
as rustlers and gunslingers.

198
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,603
That's absurd!

199
00:15:57,854 --> 00:16:00,272
See what you started
with your gravy, Nana?

200
00:16:00,691 --> 00:16:03,902
To we, the 20 million.

201
00:16:04,737 --> 00:16:06,029
- Salute!
- Salute!

202
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,199
- Cent'anni.
- Salute.

203
00:16:26,718 --> 00:16:27,927
What?

204
00:16:28,137 --> 00:16:29,720
Come here.
We're exterminating.

205
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:30,930
I'm busy now.

206
00:16:31,182 --> 00:16:33,183
Get some sfogliatelle for the guys.

207
00:16:33,476 --> 00:16:34,977
Yeah.

208
00:16:50,703 --> 00:16:51,744
Twenty-nine.

209
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:01,212
Here you go, big guy.

210
00:17:10,807 --> 00:17:12,349
Hey, Gino. What can I get you?

211
00:17:12,726 --> 00:17:15,644
- Get me some...
- Number 34, right here!

212
00:17:16,104 --> 00:17:18,522
He just went out
to get gas in his car.

213
00:17:18,816 --> 00:17:22,944
I go out, fuck your sister, come
back Saturday, I go to the front?

214
00:17:23,154 --> 00:17:24,279
I said he could.

215
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,489
Poppin' Fresh, I'm in no mood!

216
00:17:26,741 --> 00:17:29,451
I'm next, now get
a fucking pastry box.

217
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,495
Gino, what can I get you?

218
00:17:32,747 --> 00:17:34,331
Dougie, let him go first.

219
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,459
He don't make the rules here!

220
00:17:38,545 --> 00:17:40,546
All right, two Neapolitan loaves...

221
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:44,842
You touch a single crust, you'll
wish you took that job at McDonalds!

222
00:17:45,093 --> 00:17:46,093
Fuck you!

223
00:17:46,595 --> 00:17:48,346
Okay, take a walk.

224
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:52,516
- What about my bread?
- You come back in 10 minutes.

225
00:17:52,894 --> 00:17:54,603
What do you think you're doing?

226
00:17:54,896 --> 00:17:56,271
Come on.

227
00:18:04,155 --> 00:18:06,823
Get up, I'm not gonna hurt you.

228
00:18:08,535 --> 00:18:11,329
What is it?
Do I look like a pussy to you?

229
00:18:11,538 --> 00:18:14,666
- No.
- Seriously, be honest, I won't get mad.

230
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,209
- No.
- No?

231
00:18:16,377 --> 00:18:19,671
So why give me a hard time
and talk to me like I'm nothing?

232
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,839
I'm sorry.

233
00:18:22,342 --> 00:18:24,134
Get a pastry box.

234
00:18:25,053 --> 00:18:26,470
Move it!

235
00:18:29,266 --> 00:18:30,557
That's better.

236
00:18:31,184 --> 00:18:34,937
Now fill it with cannoli,
sfogliatelle and napoleons.

237
00:18:40,069 --> 00:18:41,486
Move.

238
00:18:44,699 --> 00:18:45,740
Good.

239
00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:51,579
Give me the box. Come on.

240
00:18:51,872 --> 00:18:53,540
Here.

241
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:03,050
Next time you see my face,
show some respect.

242
00:19:03,302 --> 00:19:04,802
I will.

243
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:09,307
You motherfucker!

244
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,934
You shot my foot!

245
00:19:11,394 --> 00:19:14,813
- It happens.
- You fucking asshole!

246
00:19:20,236 --> 00:19:24,740
If I'm getting an invitation to the
dance, I wish the feds would hurry up.

247
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,743
You heard what the news said.

248
00:19:27,036 --> 00:19:29,662
The way things are working,
it's Junior's party.

249
00:19:29,913 --> 00:19:32,749
That was a far-thinking plan
you had there, Tone.

250
00:19:34,835 --> 00:19:36,836
I called you last Christmas.

251
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,087
Fuck this!

252
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:41,090
The sfogliatelle!
What's wrong with you?

253
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,845
What are you doing?
You brought up in a barn, or what?

254
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:46,638
What's the matter with you?

255
00:19:46,931 --> 00:19:51,310
This is no time to go on the rag.
Not with the indictment coming down.

256
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:55,105
Take Georgie, go in the bathroom,
sweep for bugs.

257
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,149
Come on.

258
00:20:04,784 --> 00:20:07,285
Well, I hope they'll be all right.

259
00:20:07,995 --> 00:20:09,120
Who?

260
00:20:09,705 --> 00:20:11,998
- The guys.
- What about me?

261
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,126
They didn't even
mention your name on TV.

262
00:20:15,337 --> 00:20:19,715
Amazing, huh? That news guy,
he said the words "Brendan Filone"...

263
00:20:19,966 --> 00:20:23,677
...the hairs on the back of my neck,
they fucking stood up.

264
00:20:23,887 --> 00:20:25,096
I knew the guy.

265
00:20:25,806 --> 00:20:28,682
They made him look like
John-fucking-Gotti.

266
00:20:29,143 --> 00:20:30,644
I brought him around here.

267
00:20:31,354 --> 00:20:35,732
Tony wouldn't have never known him
if it wasn't for me.

268
00:20:35,983 --> 00:20:37,234
I had no idea.

269
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:58,923
Who is it? I'm sleeping.

270
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:02,176
- Carmela.
- Oh, come on in.

271
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:05,973
I just said that in case
you were...

272
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:09,560
...that snooty-assed Mrs. Ryan
down the hall.

273
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:14,481
She is so shanty Irish,
and with all her airs.

274
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:17,568
- Come on, I'm taking you to brunch.
- What?

275
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:18,987
Get dressed.

276
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,780
What's wrong? Tell me.

277
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:23,491
Why does something have to be wrong?

278
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:25,535
Meadow? She eats like a bird.

279
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:28,997
Everything is fine, Ma, relax!
Nothing is wrong.

280
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:34,002
You come here unannounced. I shouldn't
wonder if something's wrong?

281
00:21:34,504 --> 00:21:39,383
Jeez, I'm sorry. It's a nice day,
I thought I would take you out.

282
00:21:41,761 --> 00:21:43,846
I don't want to go out!

283
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,018
Is it Anthony? Those indictments?

284
00:21:49,312 --> 00:21:51,813
His father could take it in stride,
but he can't.

285
00:21:52,356 --> 00:21:53,648
I don't believe you.

286
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,112
Ma, will you get dressed?

287
00:21:59,363 --> 00:22:02,365
- We just went to a wedding!
- That was a big to-do.

288
00:22:02,575 --> 00:22:05,577
This way we get to spend
some quality time.

289
00:22:07,748 --> 00:22:10,416
The Manor will stop serving
brunch any minute.

290
00:22:14,755 --> 00:22:16,380
Did he cheat on you again?

291
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:21,969
I try to do something nice.
I come here to take you out.

292
00:22:22,222 --> 00:22:26,934
You think I have some other agenda
that I have to talk to you about?

293
00:22:27,185 --> 00:22:28,977
Don't flatter yourself.

294
00:22:29,938 --> 00:22:33,357
I'll...
I'll throw something on.

295
00:22:36,946 --> 00:22:38,988
Buckle your seat belt, Ma.

296
00:22:39,615 --> 00:22:42,617
I can't find it! Where is it?

297
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:10,543
It's not definite.
I just thought I'd tell you.

298
00:24:10,795 --> 00:24:13,380
In case I don't show up
for an appointment.

299
00:24:13,673 --> 00:24:18,552
You're telling me you're planning
a vacation, but you're not sure when?

300
00:24:18,887 --> 00:24:20,054
Right.

301
00:24:22,223 --> 00:24:24,016
I may never go.

302
00:24:26,228 --> 00:24:27,812
Let's put it this way:

303
00:24:29,357 --> 00:24:32,275
There's a strong possibility
that it could happen.

304
00:24:34,528 --> 00:24:38,907
Does this have anything to do
with what's been on the news lately?

305
00:24:43,246 --> 00:24:46,374
If you suddenly stop coming
to your appointments...

306
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:49,251
...I will assume that you are
on vacation?

307
00:24:49,795 --> 00:24:52,588
And I should wait to be contacted?

308
00:24:52,923 --> 00:24:55,091
That would be a good assumption.

309
00:25:01,474 --> 00:25:05,686
- Who is it?
- Paulie. Open the door.

310
00:25:24,331 --> 00:25:26,332
I thought we were stepping out.

311
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,211
I got two broads in the car.

312
00:25:30,463 --> 00:25:33,006
You said Ad went to stay
at her mother's.

313
00:25:36,678 --> 00:25:40,389
No wonder. The place looks
like a fucking sty.

314
00:25:43,017 --> 00:25:44,226
What's wrong?

315
00:25:46,397 --> 00:25:48,815
Talk to me. This ain't like you, kid.

316
00:25:52,027 --> 00:25:53,820
I ran into Billy Cracciolo.

317
00:25:54,113 --> 00:25:55,947
The meter maid?
What about him?

318
00:25:56,198 --> 00:25:59,117
Told me the cops in Nutley
are looking for a guy.

319
00:25:59,368 --> 00:26:03,496
Blew off a kid's toe for
no good reason in Russo's Bakery.

320
00:26:03,749 --> 00:26:04,999
Drove a Lexus?

321
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,504
Does Tony know about this?

322
00:26:12,382 --> 00:26:13,966
What's going on, Chrissy?

323
00:26:14,843 --> 00:26:19,013
Been working my ass off on this script.
You know how many pages I got?

324
00:26:19,182 --> 00:26:20,265
Nineteen.

325
00:26:21,392 --> 00:26:23,393
That a lot or a little?

326
00:26:23,853 --> 00:26:27,397
Books say a movie's supposed to be
about 120 pages.

327
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,983
I thought the computer would
do a lot of it.

328
00:26:30,485 --> 00:26:32,360
You're being frank
about the business...

329
00:26:32,528 --> 00:26:36,031
I would never do that.
It's only "suggested by."

330
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:41,370
That writer, with the bullfights?
Blew his own fucking head off.

331
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,081
I bought a scriptwriting program.

332
00:26:44,625 --> 00:26:47,585
My advice?
Put that thing down awhile.

333
00:26:47,795 --> 00:26:49,295
We get our joints copped.

334
00:26:49,547 --> 00:26:52,591
Tomorrow, the words will come
blowing out your ass.

335
00:26:54,552 --> 00:26:57,387
You ever feel like nothing
good would ever happen?

336
00:26:57,639 --> 00:27:00,140
Yeah. And nothing did. So what?

337
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,059
I'm alive, I'm surviving.

338
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:05,395
That's it.
I don't want to just survive.

339
00:27:05,648 --> 00:27:10,401
It says in movie-writing books that
every character has an arc, understand?

340
00:27:12,363 --> 00:27:16,533
Everybody starts out somewheres
and then they do something...

341
00:27:16,742 --> 00:27:19,369
...it changes their life.
That's their arc.

342
00:27:19,578 --> 00:27:21,329
Where's my arc?

343
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:26,418
All right, take Richard Kimble, right?

344
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:32,258
No, that's no good. His arc is
run, run, jump off the dam...

345
00:27:35,136 --> 00:27:37,471
Keanu Reeves, Devil's Advocate.

346
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,766
- AI.
- Right.

347
00:27:41,143 --> 00:27:45,564
Keanu's a lawyer, gets all turned on
by money, power and the Devil.

348
00:27:45,773 --> 00:27:50,360
Then his wife says, "You're not
the man I married," leaves him.

349
00:27:50,695 --> 00:27:51,820
You see the arc?

350
00:27:54,324 --> 00:27:57,910
He starts down here, he ends up here.

351
00:27:58,161 --> 00:28:00,288
Where's my arc, Paulie?

352
00:28:01,498 --> 00:28:02,665
Kid...

353
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:06,919
...Richard Kimble, the Devil's
whatever, those are all make-believe.

354
00:28:08,464 --> 00:28:10,090
I got no arc either.

355
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:15,304
I was born, grew up, spent a few years
in the Army, a few more in the can.

356
00:28:15,513 --> 00:28:18,724
And here I am. A half a wiseguy.
So what?

357
00:28:18,975 --> 00:28:21,268
I got no identity.

358
00:28:21,477 --> 00:28:24,938
Even Brendan Filone's got
an identity. He's dead.

359
00:28:25,649 --> 00:28:28,318
I killed that fucking Emil Kolar,
and nothing.

360
00:28:28,527 --> 00:28:30,320
I don't even move up a notch.

361
00:28:30,613 --> 00:28:32,864
All I got is nightmares.

362
00:28:33,574 --> 00:28:35,992
That Polish, Czech,
whatever he is...

363
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,870
...is haunting me in my dreams
every night.

364
00:28:39,163 --> 00:28:42,749
That happens. The more of them
you do, the better you'll sleep.

365
00:28:43,001 --> 00:28:45,628
I had one prick for months
in my dreams.

366
00:28:45,837 --> 00:28:50,132
I feel like he's trying to tell me
we fucked up the night we buried him.

367
00:28:50,342 --> 00:28:52,176
- We didn't.
- I'm in danger.

368
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,636
Can I ask a question?

369
00:28:53,887 --> 00:28:56,555
Why would he tell you
you're in danger...

370
00:28:56,766 --> 00:28:59,726
...considering you put
a moonroof in his head?

371
00:29:00,311 --> 00:29:02,479
What did we do wrong that night?

372
00:29:02,688 --> 00:29:05,941
The gun was hot, so the slugs
couldn't be traced to me.

373
00:29:06,233 --> 00:29:08,652
You know who had an ark?
Noah.

374
00:29:31,094 --> 00:29:32,094
Is that him?

375
00:29:32,261 --> 00:29:35,764
That would be some fucking
coincidence if it wasn't, wouldn't it?

376
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,269
- Holy shit! Look.
- What?

377
00:29:41,521 --> 00:29:44,147
He was clean-shaven.
He's got a beard now.

378
00:29:44,358 --> 00:29:46,943
You know what?
I read that. That happens.

379
00:29:47,361 --> 00:29:49,278
I always thought it was bullshit.

380
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:51,322
Look at his fingernails!

381
00:29:51,532 --> 00:29:53,157
They're like a woman's.

382
00:29:53,409 --> 00:29:55,827
I'm gonna fucking puke.

383
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:03,167
Help me lift him and take him to Pine
Barrens before they build a condo here.

384
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,920
Georgie!

385
00:30:08,633 --> 00:30:10,843
I don't know about
selling this property.

386
00:30:11,136 --> 00:30:14,388
I don't know about you,
but I sure could use an infusion...

387
00:30:14,639 --> 00:30:17,725
...if we're supporting Jase
after he graduates.

388
00:30:17,935 --> 00:30:22,188
It's funny how even during our
marriage, we saw things differently.

389
00:30:23,774 --> 00:30:26,609
I never saw this place
as an investment.

390
00:30:26,861 --> 00:30:29,446
I always thought
that we'd build a house.

391
00:30:31,283 --> 00:30:33,200
So are we gonna sell, or what?

392
00:30:34,161 --> 00:30:35,578
For Jason.

393
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:39,790
I don't want to hear that you took
one of your Colleens on a cruise.

394
00:30:40,167 --> 00:30:42,543
What's that supposed to mean,
"Colleens"?

395
00:30:42,794 --> 00:30:46,047
We all know you're a sucker
for those Irish girls.

396
00:30:46,382 --> 00:30:49,217
Every Italian boy
bows down to the freckles.

397
00:30:49,469 --> 00:30:52,387
- I married you!
- Yeah, I was a mother figure.

398
00:30:52,597 --> 00:30:55,015
Don't bust my balls
with Freud-by-numbers.

399
00:30:55,224 --> 00:30:58,685
Don't bust my balls?
Richard, your calabrese is showing.

400
00:30:58,978 --> 00:31:03,607
Are you implying by all this
I'm ashamed to be an Italian-American?

401
00:31:03,817 --> 00:31:06,652
With all the poverty, starvation,
ethnic cleansing...

402
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,946
...and horrible shit in this world...

403
00:31:09,156 --> 00:31:13,367
...you devote your energy to protecting
the dignity of Connie Francis!

404
00:31:16,955 --> 00:31:18,998
You're worked up about my patient...

405
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:23,170
...a man who has no bearing on
who or where you are in this world.

406
00:31:23,379 --> 00:31:26,465
Call him a patient.
The man's a criminal, Jennifer.

407
00:31:26,674 --> 00:31:30,177
And after a while, you're gonna
get beyond psychotherapy...

408
00:31:30,386 --> 00:31:32,513
...with its cheesy moral relativism.

409
00:31:32,722 --> 00:31:36,350
Finally, you're gonna get
to good and evil. And he's evil.

410
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,793
Sorry I'm late. The alarm...

411
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:02,920
What is wrong with you?

412
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,964
I ain't been feeling good.

413
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:07,883
- I wipe my ass with your feelings.
- Thanks.

414
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:10,178
Drive the fucking car!

415
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:23,859
We're under a microscope. I hear you
shot some kid because he made you wait!

416
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:26,404
- Fucking Paulie!
- Don't blame Paulie!

417
00:32:26,655 --> 00:32:30,324
Nutley PD's got a description
and a make on the car!

418
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:32,618
Why don't you leave a urine sample?

419
00:32:32,828 --> 00:32:34,328
- If I could...
- Shut up!

420
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:38,082
Georgie comes in with vomit all over.
I ask, "What the fuck?"

421
00:32:38,334 --> 00:32:40,460
He said you're digging up some body!

422
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,254
- I was worried...
- Shut up!

423
00:32:42,463 --> 00:32:44,756
- You want to get caught.
- I want to?

424
00:32:45,008 --> 00:32:48,260
Yeah. I seen it before.
That's fucking cowboy-itis.

425
00:32:48,553 --> 00:32:49,970
You want to be a bad guy?

426
00:32:50,221 --> 00:32:52,848
- I was worried that I didn't...
- Shut up!

427
00:32:59,273 --> 00:33:01,566
Can I try and explain here?

428
00:33:04,778 --> 00:33:06,779
I don't know, Tony.

429
00:33:07,573 --> 00:33:11,367
It's like the regular-ness of life
is too fucking hard for me.

430
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,454
I don't know.

431
00:33:19,377 --> 00:33:20,961
Look at you.

432
00:33:22,631 --> 00:33:24,965
I'll bet you're sleeping all the time.

433
00:33:25,176 --> 00:33:27,427
It's the only thing I still enjoy.

434
00:33:29,805 --> 00:33:31,598
You know what I think?

435
00:33:32,058 --> 00:33:35,310
Maybe I have cancer.

436
00:33:36,145 --> 00:33:37,979
Remember how Jackie got?

437
00:33:38,773 --> 00:33:39,856
Cancer?

438
00:33:40,149 --> 00:33:44,027
Something fucking horrible
is going on inside my body.

439
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:47,448
Does this word "cancer"
pop into your mind a lot...

440
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:49,992
...a little bit, what?

441
00:33:50,494 --> 00:33:51,535
Huh?

442
00:33:51,828 --> 00:33:54,956
Well, I'm just thinking,
maybe you're...

443
00:33:55,999 --> 00:33:57,667
- ...depressed.
- Me?

444
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,712
I'm no fucking mental midget.

445
00:34:05,385 --> 00:34:06,760
Right.

446
00:34:10,098 --> 00:34:11,390
- Watch the...
- What?

447
00:34:11,641 --> 00:34:14,017
- Filter.
- Oh, fuck!

448
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:27,323
Maybe you got...

449
00:34:27,574 --> 00:34:32,537
...a serotonin problem,
or whatever the fuck they call it.

450
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,790
You know about that shit?

451
00:34:35,834 --> 00:34:39,211
I saw it last night on a program.

452
00:34:39,546 --> 00:34:43,215
What, take fucking Prozac?
Not this skinny guinea.

453
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:48,388
Let me ask a question.

454
00:34:50,558 --> 00:34:52,726
You ever think about...

455
00:34:53,769 --> 00:34:55,228
...you know...

456
00:34:57,189 --> 00:34:58,773
Fuck no!

457
00:35:00,402 --> 00:35:01,402
Good.

458
00:35:04,156 --> 00:35:07,491
Bunch of losers blowing
their skulls all over the bathroom?

459
00:35:08,827 --> 00:35:10,786
It's fucking pathetic.

460
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:35,855
- Did you hear the doorbell?
- I'm in the middle of a game.

461
00:35:36,106 --> 00:35:39,150
You'll be in the middle of
the street, you don't wise up.

462
00:35:50,872 --> 00:35:52,539
Anthony Soprano?

463
00:35:53,458 --> 00:35:54,958
Why are you in my yard?

464
00:35:55,418 --> 00:35:56,585
The gate was open.

465
00:35:56,836 --> 00:36:00,005
I'm Agent Harris, this is
Agent Driscol. May we come in?

466
00:36:00,215 --> 00:36:01,215
If I say no?

467
00:36:02,092 --> 00:36:04,343
If we were local, we wouldn't knock.

468
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:06,971
What's your point?

469
00:36:07,473 --> 00:36:10,350
We have a search warrant.
We know you have children.

470
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:15,313
Our other team's out front. We don't
traumatize kids by kicking in doors.

471
00:36:15,564 --> 00:36:19,567
So why don't you take a minute
and tell them you have visitors.

472
00:36:35,253 --> 00:36:36,461
Hmm.

473
00:36:43,511 --> 00:36:45,679
Any quarters, you can keep.

474
00:36:45,847 --> 00:36:47,848
You trying to bribe me?

475
00:36:48,724 --> 00:36:51,685
Tell me what you're looking for,
I can save you time.

476
00:36:51,979 --> 00:36:54,689
Any incriminating evidence
would be nice.

477
00:36:56,984 --> 00:36:58,484
Dad!

478
00:36:59,027 --> 00:37:01,821
- I have an English paper!
- You gotta be shitting me.

479
00:37:02,197 --> 00:37:04,782
I better have all my programs
when it comes back.

480
00:37:05,033 --> 00:37:06,200
Anthony!

481
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:11,540
What the hell are they doing
in my kitchen?

482
00:37:15,128 --> 00:37:16,587
What are you doing?

483
00:37:16,796 --> 00:37:18,630
Forgot your lunch, just ask.

484
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,132
I'm very sorry.

485
00:37:20,383 --> 00:37:22,718
How much would you say
that bowl cost?

486
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:25,930
- I'm not cleaning that up.
- Grasso, clean that.

487
00:37:26,182 --> 00:37:28,850
Grasso, ti faccio un culo così.

488
00:37:29,393 --> 00:37:30,435
Your ass!

489
00:37:30,644 --> 00:37:31,644
Hey, Tony.

490
00:37:31,979 --> 00:37:33,938
Take it easy.
Grasso, take it easy.

491
00:37:34,857 --> 00:37:36,774
We'll be gone in a few minutes.

492
00:37:37,193 --> 00:37:38,735
Let's wait in the living room.

493
00:37:38,987 --> 00:37:41,155
Clean up the bowl.

494
00:37:41,406 --> 00:37:42,573
Come on.

495
00:37:51,124 --> 00:37:53,667
I know they're doing their job,
but I'm pissed.

496
00:37:54,044 --> 00:37:55,878
Harris wasn't so bad.

497
00:37:56,172 --> 00:38:00,342
He was the biggest sneak out of
all of them. It's part of his act.

498
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,594
That guy broke the bowl on purpose.

499
00:38:02,803 --> 00:38:04,763
He was just a klutz.

500
00:38:04,972 --> 00:38:06,932
What was his last name?

501
00:38:07,183 --> 00:38:09,768
- Rizzo, Razzo, what?
- Grasso.

502
00:38:09,936 --> 00:38:12,771
Grasso. You think it's a coincidence
they sent him?

503
00:38:12,981 --> 00:38:16,776
If he wasn't Italian, he'd be
at the office sweeping up. Jerk.

504
00:38:16,985 --> 00:38:19,153
Bet they frisk him
before he goes home.

505
00:38:19,404 --> 00:38:20,613
- Why?
- Why?

506
00:38:20,948 --> 00:38:23,991
Because he has a vowel
at the end of his name: Grasso.

507
00:38:24,243 --> 00:38:27,411
Does he think he'll make it to the top
by arresting his own people?

508
00:38:27,622 --> 00:38:28,789
Pass the moo shu.

509
00:38:28,998 --> 00:38:30,958
He'll see. He'll learn.

510
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:34,002
- We have a vowel.
- And you be proud of it!

511
00:38:34,295 --> 00:38:38,173
You'd think there was no Michelangelo,
the way they treat people.

512
00:38:38,633 --> 00:38:40,801
An Italian invented the telephone.

513
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:45,013
- Alexander Graham Bell was Italian?
- You see? You see what...?

514
00:38:45,307 --> 00:38:48,434
Antonio Meucci invented it,
and he got robbed!

515
00:38:48,644 --> 00:38:50,270
Everybody knows that!

516
00:38:51,272 --> 00:38:53,398
Who invented the Mafia?

517
00:38:54,149 --> 00:38:55,275
What?

518
00:38:55,484 --> 00:38:58,653
- La Cosa Nostra. Who invented that?
- Who cares.

519
00:38:58,863 --> 00:39:02,491
Wasn't it Salvatore Lucania,
known as Charlie "Lucky" Luciano...

520
00:39:02,742 --> 00:39:07,830
...who organized the five families:
Lucchese, Gambino, Bonanno, Profaci.

521
00:39:08,123 --> 00:39:10,416
Is there something
you want to say to me?

522
00:39:12,127 --> 00:39:14,169
I just like history, like you, Dad.

523
00:39:14,422 --> 00:39:16,506
Can you shut the fuck up about it?

524
00:39:16,799 --> 00:39:18,383
- Hey!
- Hey!

525
00:39:21,345 --> 00:39:23,805
A.J., did you know
John Cabot was Italian?

526
00:39:24,098 --> 00:39:26,308
- Whoa.
- Like he knows who that is.

527
00:39:26,642 --> 00:39:28,518
The famous discoverer of Canada.

528
00:39:28,811 --> 00:39:30,228
The Bank of America.

529
00:39:30,522 --> 00:39:34,525
One of the biggest banks in the world,
started by an Italian.

530
00:39:34,776 --> 00:39:37,778
The first American saint
was Italian. Mother Cabrini.

531
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:42,199
Is it true the Chinese
invented spaghetti?

532
00:39:42,451 --> 00:39:45,536
Now think. Why would people
who eat with sticks...

533
00:39:45,788 --> 00:39:48,206
...invent something
you need a fork to eat?

534
00:39:49,834 --> 00:39:51,543
Here's more I bet you don't know.

535
00:39:51,836 --> 00:39:56,131
More Italians fought for the U.S.
in WWII than any other ethnic group.

536
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:59,593
They won't tell you
about Sacco and Vanzetti.

537
00:39:59,886 --> 00:40:02,387
The anti-Christs
that got the electric chair?

538
00:40:02,598 --> 00:40:05,391
- Anarchists.
- Isn't it anti-Christs?

539
00:40:05,601 --> 00:40:08,853
They were innocent and got
the chair because they were Italian.

540
00:40:09,063 --> 00:40:11,773
How are there two anti-Christs
and only one Christ?

541
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:13,399
So?

542
00:40:13,609 --> 00:40:17,070
And of course, Francis Albert.

543
00:40:20,367 --> 00:40:21,784
Will I see you next week?

544
00:40:22,077 --> 00:40:23,577
Unless you know something I don't.

545
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:27,373
You understand, I have to charge you
for the missed session.

546
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,000
What do you mean?

547
00:40:30,251 --> 00:40:32,503
We agreed on that
on our first meeting.

548
00:40:32,754 --> 00:40:34,880
But I just explained my situation.

549
00:40:35,091 --> 00:40:38,760
I understand, but it's important
that we respect the agreement.

550
00:40:40,888 --> 00:40:43,598
- What if I got hit by a car?
- But you weren't.

551
00:40:43,891 --> 00:40:46,976
- I know, but what if?
- But you weren't.

552
00:40:47,228 --> 00:40:48,853
I know that, but what if?

553
00:40:49,064 --> 00:40:51,482
- You weren't.
- Answer my fucking question!

554
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:53,984
I will not.

555
00:40:54,236 --> 00:40:55,486
You won't?

556
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,280
All right, fine.

557
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,950
Fine, here. Here you go.

558
00:41:01,535 --> 00:41:04,787
This is what it's all about.
Motherfucking, cocksucking money!

559
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:06,164
Here!

560
00:41:08,835 --> 00:41:13,004
I don't understand that, and I don't
appreciate being made to feel afraid.

561
00:41:13,297 --> 00:41:16,800
I don't appreciate feeling like
I pour my heart to a call girl!

562
00:41:17,009 --> 00:41:19,845
- Is that how you see me?
- Not until now.

563
00:41:20,138 --> 00:41:24,015
But it's obvious you don't give a shit
about my situation.

564
00:41:24,226 --> 00:41:26,477
Otherwise, you wouldn't
shake me down.

565
00:41:29,815 --> 00:41:32,233
It'll show as paid
on your next bill.

566
00:41:32,484 --> 00:41:33,609
Fine.

567
00:41:34,069 --> 00:41:36,320
Stick it up your ass.

568
00:41:45,498 --> 00:41:47,374
And how about Dr. Goldman here?

569
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:52,004
He was gonna be a tree surgeon,
but he fainted at the sight of sap!

570
00:41:52,256 --> 00:41:54,048
Sap, ladies and gentlemen.

571
00:41:54,675 --> 00:41:58,219
Pace yourselves.
Don't spend it all in one place.

572
00:41:58,429 --> 00:42:02,515
Movie night, right? Last week they
showed the Polish version of Rashomon.

573
00:42:02,808 --> 00:42:05,852
Everybody remembers the rape
exactly the same!

574
00:42:07,271 --> 00:42:09,939
What's the matter with you, Corrado?

575
00:42:10,192 --> 00:42:14,153
Headaches, that's all.
Not the kind you take aspirin for.

576
00:42:14,362 --> 00:42:18,616
Now, tonight on our show, we have
Mitzi Gaynor, Sergio Franchi...

577
00:42:18,867 --> 00:42:23,204
...and a woman from France will pull
light bulbs from her husband's throat.

578
00:42:23,455 --> 00:42:24,997
This woman can relate.

579
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:26,833
We may have a bad apple.

580
00:42:27,543 --> 00:42:29,836
Does Tony know about this?

581
00:42:30,505 --> 00:42:31,546
What will you do?

582
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:34,633
There's not much to do.
We sit back and wait.

583
00:42:35,218 --> 00:42:39,054
Don't let Tony know you know.
He's under enough pressure.

584
00:42:39,514 --> 00:42:41,056
Yeah.

585
00:42:41,391 --> 00:42:45,603
I'm sure he's telling his psychiatrist
it's all his mother's fault.

586
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:47,230
What, a psychiatrist?

587
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:50,858
Yeah, a psychiatrist.

588
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,861
He's been seeing one for a while now.

589
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:57,783
God only knows what he says.

590
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:00,661
- Tony?
- Yes, Tony.

591
00:43:00,954 --> 00:43:04,248
Tony, who had such a terrible mother.

592
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:05,958
A psychiatrist?

593
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:09,545
Yes, Junior. For chrissake!

594
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:13,799
Show of hands, how many people think
J.F.K is still alive? Come on.

595
00:43:14,385 --> 00:43:19,222
They should take a Zapruder film of
your salad bar. Hello? Help me out!

596
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:21,558
Who? The psychiatrist, I mean.

597
00:43:21,809 --> 00:43:23,810
Do you think I know?

598
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:26,938
- What did you say to Tony about this?
- Me?

599
00:43:27,189 --> 00:43:28,606
Nothing.

600
00:43:28,984 --> 00:43:31,610
I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.

601
00:43:31,862 --> 00:43:36,949
And, Junior, I don't want
there to be any repercussions.

602
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:40,786
A psychiatrist?

603
00:43:41,621 --> 00:43:45,791
You're a broken record.
Yes, yes!

604
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,003
- Do I have to...?
- Shh!

605
00:43:52,049 --> 00:43:54,467
Do I have to say it again?

606
00:43:56,971 --> 00:44:01,266
Picture yourself
at Ellis Island. How does that sound?

607
00:44:06,023 --> 00:44:07,857
It's me. Leave a message.

608
00:44:08,066 --> 00:44:10,735
Christopher? It's Mommy.

609
00:44:10,986 --> 00:44:13,237
I know you're there. Pick it up.

610
00:44:13,655 --> 00:44:17,033
Are you all right?
I'm worried about you.

611
00:44:17,285 --> 00:44:21,872
My God, they mentioned your name
in the newspaper. The Star-Ledger.

612
00:44:22,165 --> 00:44:26,168
Mrs. Jones told me.
With all those scumbags!

613
00:44:26,794 --> 00:44:29,671
It's been a while
since we met for therapy.

614
00:44:32,301 --> 00:44:35,094
Jason, how's Bard?

615
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:41,601
I'm moving into a smoke-free dorm.

616
00:44:44,313 --> 00:44:46,189
And how do we feel about that?

617
00:44:46,608 --> 00:44:49,276
I'm interested
in discussing what we mentioned.

618
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:53,322
Jason, are you concerned that your
mother is treating this patient X?

619
00:44:54,699 --> 00:44:57,201
I don't care.

620
00:44:57,869 --> 00:45:02,414
As a colleague, Jen,
I suggest you drop the patient.

621
00:45:02,708 --> 00:45:04,376
After her last encounter...

622
00:45:04,585 --> 00:45:06,169
...she finally acknowledged...

623
00:45:06,379 --> 00:45:09,547
...that she saw the different side
of him, the subhuman.

624
00:45:09,799 --> 00:45:11,883
I take it you were frightened.

625
00:45:12,551 --> 00:45:14,719
Frightened, revolted.

626
00:45:14,971 --> 00:45:16,805
At last, appropriate emotions.

627
00:45:17,056 --> 00:45:19,432
Oh, for chrissake, Richard.
You too, Sam.

628
00:45:19,935 --> 00:45:22,687
When did we become afraid
to get our hands dirty?

629
00:45:22,938 --> 00:45:24,563
It's what she gets paid for.

630
00:45:24,773 --> 00:45:27,566
Jason, how would you like
to see your mother?

631
00:45:29,236 --> 00:45:33,447
Never mind, I'm not gonna paint
any graphic images.

632
00:45:34,075 --> 00:45:36,451
See? He always does that.

633
00:45:36,703 --> 00:45:37,703
What?

634
00:45:37,954 --> 00:45:40,998
Follow that up, Jase. Dad does what?

635
00:45:41,249 --> 00:45:44,084
His issue is that I should
distance myself from this man...

636
00:45:44,293 --> 00:45:47,087
...on the grounds of the stigma
that he brings us.

637
00:45:48,006 --> 00:45:50,966
I say refer this patient
to a therapist...

638
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:55,263
...that specializes
in Mafia depression.

639
00:45:58,892 --> 00:46:00,059
This isn't funny.

640
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:01,978
No, of course not.

641
00:46:03,731 --> 00:46:08,818
Jen has a real honest to goodness
personal and professional dilemma.

642
00:46:12,282 --> 00:46:16,535
You know, on my mother's side,
we have a few dark sheep.

643
00:46:16,786 --> 00:46:17,995
Excuse me?

644
00:46:19,956 --> 00:46:20,998
Lepke.

645
00:46:26,297 --> 00:46:27,338
Who's Lepke?

646
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,800
Louis "Lepke" Buchalter.

647
00:46:31,052 --> 00:46:33,970
You know. Murder, Incorporated.

648
00:46:36,891 --> 00:46:39,809
My mother's uncle
was Lepke's wheelman.

649
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,645
His driver.

650
00:46:43,315 --> 00:46:44,315
Uh-huh?

651
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:48,319
Those were some tough Jews.


1
00:01:38,184 --> 00:01:40,185
Come on! Come on, dog!
Come on!

2
00:01:40,353 --> 00:01:42,020
Come on! Come on.

3
00:01:45,358 --> 00:01:48,610
Look at this!
Look at this plastic!

4
00:01:48,945 --> 00:01:50,529
And there's weeds!

5
00:01:50,823 --> 00:01:52,782
Well, it looks like Tobacco Road.

6
00:01:53,117 --> 00:01:55,576
- Nobody gets down here.
- Anthony!

7
00:01:55,786 --> 00:01:58,371
Those dogs are wild dogs.

8
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:00,373
Cemetery dogs.

9
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:02,500
They'll take your hand off.

10
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:06,504
Come over here. Say a Hail Mary
for your grandfather.

11
00:02:06,714 --> 00:02:07,964
Lay off. He's a kid.

12
00:02:08,173 --> 00:02:11,634
So he should neglect his elders?
Just like his father.

13
00:02:11,885 --> 00:02:13,553
Yeah, a real skimp.

14
00:02:13,722 --> 00:02:14,888
My son.

15
00:02:15,765 --> 00:02:17,725
The mental patient.

16
00:02:17,892 --> 00:02:21,645
Remember those trips to the Shore?
Me and Tony rode the waves?

17
00:02:21,896 --> 00:02:23,272
I taught him to bodysurf.

18
00:02:23,523 --> 00:02:26,191
My son was brought up right.

19
00:02:26,526 --> 00:02:28,777
He needs a psychiatrist for what?

20
00:02:29,112 --> 00:02:31,196
- To talk about his sex life?
- Enough.

21
00:02:31,906 --> 00:02:33,365
I hate it as much as you do.

22
00:02:33,575 --> 00:02:34,742
Anthony!

23
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:37,745
Those dogs could start
foaming at the mouth.

24
00:02:37,955 --> 00:02:41,458
How come you're not supposed
to breathe in the cemetery?

25
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:44,294
- Who says?
- It's a joke. Say, "Why?"

26
00:02:44,545 --> 00:02:46,671
You'll make the dead people jealous.

27
00:02:50,426 --> 00:02:52,761
Okay, come pick it up! Pick it up.

28
00:02:52,928 --> 00:02:55,221
Who's got the ball?!

29
00:02:55,431 --> 00:02:56,765
Oh, my God! Look out!

30
00:02:57,141 --> 00:02:58,933
Come around, come around!

31
00:02:59,936 --> 00:03:01,729
Up, up, up! Cover them through!

32
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,230
I can't watch.

33
00:03:04,107 --> 00:03:05,274
Yes!

34
00:03:05,525 --> 00:03:09,362
Way to go, Meadow!
You're a brick wall, baby! Brick wall!

35
00:03:09,613 --> 00:03:12,114
Good save!
Come on, now. Come on!

36
00:03:12,324 --> 00:03:14,241
That was close.

37
00:03:14,618 --> 00:03:17,953
- Pretty good.
- Look at you. At girls' soccer, Tony.

38
00:03:18,163 --> 00:03:20,706
What do you want?
My son's a couch potato.

39
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:23,335
- Red! Five!
- Are you yellow-card happy?

40
00:03:23,961 --> 00:03:25,754
Rough play, my ass!

41
00:03:28,383 --> 00:03:30,634
- Hi, honey.
- Go get them, baby.

42
00:03:31,135 --> 00:03:33,970
This fat kid is such a sneak
with that elbow!

43
00:03:34,263 --> 00:03:37,641
Coach says next year,
Chiara is gonna be one of his starts.

44
00:03:37,892 --> 00:03:39,768
Let's pull it out, for chrissake!

45
00:03:39,977 --> 00:03:42,729
Heather Dante!
A hundred bucks for a goal!

46
00:03:43,314 --> 00:03:46,483
What's with Ally today?
She's sleepwalking out there.

47
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,988
She eats at our house a lot.
She's got the energy.

48
00:03:51,323 --> 00:03:53,908
That tackle was our ball, asshole!

49
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,785
Zebra, I'm talking to you.

50
00:03:56,995 --> 00:03:59,622
Blow that again,
I'll stick it up your ass!

51
00:03:59,915 --> 00:04:04,043
Get off the field now, or your team
is gonna forfeit the game!

52
00:04:04,294 --> 00:04:06,504
I'm going.
You fucking son of a...

53
00:04:06,756 --> 00:04:08,340
Get off the field!

54
00:04:12,846 --> 00:04:13,887
Did a hell of a job.

55
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,017
Falcons! Falcons, heads up!

56
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,354
Red, 42! 42!

57
00:04:22,647 --> 00:04:24,523
Push! Ally!

58
00:04:25,525 --> 00:04:26,650
Come on.

59
00:04:29,237 --> 00:04:30,571
Come on, Al!

60
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,892
Did I tell you?
What did I tell you?

61
00:04:58,101 --> 00:05:01,103
He's a brilliant coach.
A beautiful, brilliant genius.

62
00:05:01,313 --> 00:05:02,813
You in love with him?

63
00:05:03,064 --> 00:05:07,651
Yes. If he steers Chiara to a college
scholarship, I'll blow the guy.

64
00:05:07,861 --> 00:05:09,236
You will?

65
00:05:11,114 --> 00:05:12,990
How's chefing at Dimples?

66
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,786
Try the salad bar. We got a chemical
brightener. It keeps lettuce crisp.

67
00:05:17,997 --> 00:05:20,123
- How nice.
- Yeah, it's beautiful.

68
00:05:20,374 --> 00:05:23,418
The offer's still there.
You put some out on the street...

69
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:27,088
...at two points,
we split the interest. Nice?

70
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:32,177
I can't do the math.
I'm an artiste.

71
00:05:33,095 --> 00:05:34,429
Get out of here.

72
00:05:35,806 --> 00:05:37,807
Good job, girls!

73
00:05:48,403 --> 00:05:51,280
- Absolutely.
- And you do that so well, coach.

74
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,866
- Thanks.
- The psychology is important.

75
00:05:54,076 --> 00:05:55,159
Did a hell of a job.

76
00:05:55,619 --> 00:05:58,496
Welcome to Bada Bing.
Everything's on the house.

77
00:05:58,914 --> 00:06:00,206
Come meet somebody.

78
00:06:00,499 --> 00:06:02,708
- He coached college.
- Get out of here.

79
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:06,004
- Division 1-A.
- No, that's boonie state.

80
00:06:06,256 --> 00:06:10,133
Besides, it's time to stop moving
my wife and Deena like pawns...

81
00:06:10,385 --> 00:06:12,010
...when someone ups the ante.

82
00:06:12,303 --> 00:06:16,223
Anyway, how many chances does a man
get to coach his own daughter?

83
00:06:16,474 --> 00:06:18,767
- Money isn't everything.
- Here, here.

84
00:06:18,977 --> 00:06:20,310
The kids are important.

85
00:06:20,562 --> 00:06:23,939
Cheers. To the Falcons.
Continued success.

86
00:06:28,571 --> 00:06:32,740
Brandy, why don't you give the coach
a deluxe tour of the VIP lounge.

87
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,368
- What?
- Oh, guys.

88
00:06:35,619 --> 00:06:37,787
Jesus, we said a beer.

89
00:06:39,623 --> 00:06:42,208
No, I...
Thank you, but I don't think so.

90
00:06:43,794 --> 00:06:45,837
Jesus Christ.

91
00:06:46,255 --> 00:06:48,840
Okay, Brandy, go sit on a tuffet.

92
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,428
Coach, it's on the house.

93
00:06:55,265 --> 00:06:57,057
- Why are you here?
- Who's he?

94
00:06:57,309 --> 00:06:59,226
My girl's coach. You got something?

95
00:06:59,436 --> 00:07:02,187
Every car you see in the
rear-view mirror is not a fed.

96
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:05,190
Mikey Palmice went and got
a major Manhattan PI.

97
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:09,361
Mikey thinks someone here rats for
the government. What else is new?

98
00:07:09,572 --> 00:07:13,783
What else? My colleague over at
Organized Crime Task Force...

99
00:07:14,035 --> 00:07:17,746
...gets chatty after caffeine drinks.

100
00:07:18,331 --> 00:07:21,875
Names of people whose fiscal interests
intersect with your own.

101
00:07:23,336 --> 00:07:26,671
I'm still trying to find out
if you've been named.

102
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:30,967
But these people are keeping
these indictments very, very internal.

103
00:07:31,177 --> 00:07:33,762
They may have a folder
with my name on it.

104
00:07:33,972 --> 00:07:35,765
If I was smart,
I wouldn't be here.

105
00:07:35,974 --> 00:07:37,016
I rest my case.

106
00:07:37,225 --> 00:07:39,435
I'm up the street
on a rape-homicide.

107
00:07:39,686 --> 00:07:43,272
What I need now is to see
a liquor license, if you don't mind.

108
00:07:43,565 --> 00:07:47,443
So anybody wonders why I was here
or for the lie detector test...

109
00:07:47,694 --> 00:07:50,696
Cha-cha, show him the liquor license.

110
00:07:50,989 --> 00:07:52,448
Don't touch the girls.

111
00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:55,409
How you doing?

112
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,622
Bada Bing. Arthur Bucco!

113
00:08:02,335 --> 00:08:03,418
Hello?

114
00:08:03,586 --> 00:08:05,921
You gonna stay in that bar all day?

115
00:08:06,255 --> 00:08:09,257
- I'm shooting pool.
- I'll rack them up for you.

116
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:12,511
I thought we were supposed to
paint the patio.

117
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,638
I bought primer
and I've been scraping.

118
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:16,098
You have?

119
00:08:16,307 --> 00:08:18,433
I could really use your help.

120
00:08:18,686 --> 00:08:20,770
All right. I'll be right home.

121
00:08:24,358 --> 00:08:26,567
This fucking guy lays down the law.

122
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,320
Fucking blistering.
"I'll be right home."

123
00:08:29,571 --> 00:08:32,615
I gotta get home too.
Shelley'll be looking for me.

124
00:08:32,866 --> 00:08:34,951
It's quite the lifestyle
you got here.

125
00:08:35,244 --> 00:08:36,869
- See ya later, coach.
- Okay.

126
00:08:37,121 --> 00:08:39,330
Different strokes.

127
00:08:41,584 --> 00:08:43,752
Melvoin, Perlov,
Schneider and Archide.

128
00:08:46,131 --> 00:08:50,342
- What's with the indictments?
- Put it right down there.

129
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,471
The book is off on the 14th ward.

130
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,726
I don't want to minimize your position.
Two prior convictions.

131
00:08:58,977 --> 00:09:02,688
You're in jeopardy of sentence
under the habitual offenders statute.

132
00:09:02,939 --> 00:09:06,191
I'm paying you to hear shit
that's eating my insides?

133
00:09:06,402 --> 00:09:07,444
Peppers and eggs?

134
00:09:07,653 --> 00:09:10,613
Peppers and eggs?
That's what I should've had.

135
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,538
"I'd be happy to surrender
Mr. Soprano.

136
00:09:18,831 --> 00:09:21,499
You can be assured
of my full cooperation."

137
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:24,669
You'd rather they kicked in
your front door at night?

138
00:09:25,045 --> 00:09:26,921
It's a target letter, Corrado.

139
00:09:27,132 --> 00:09:30,342
I got nowhere, so I asked them
what your status was.

140
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,430
Just testing.
So what'd they say?

141
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:36,223
They'd let me know.

142
00:09:36,558 --> 00:09:38,642
I may just start paying taxes.

143
00:09:38,894 --> 00:09:40,728
God, it's a fucking burn.

144
00:09:41,021 --> 00:09:44,523
I'm sick and tired of sitting around.
I'm gonna get out of here.

145
00:09:44,691 --> 00:09:46,066
With your lady friend?

146
00:09:46,276 --> 00:09:47,777
What do you know about her?

147
00:09:48,069 --> 00:09:50,529
Works for the Joint Fitters Union,
right?

148
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:55,702
Runs their labor management fund
outside the feds' oversight.

149
00:09:56,746 --> 00:10:00,248
If you can't get your friends jobs,
why attain success?

150
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,501
The wheels of justice turn slowly.

151
00:10:03,294 --> 00:10:05,962
Take her to Florida. Develop a tan.

152
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,798
Where's the crapper key?

153
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:09,800
Top right-hand drawer.

154
00:10:10,593 --> 00:10:15,555
Junior, we're working out of a fucking
lawyer's office, is that right?

155
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:20,102
Look, I didn't want to say anything,
but this government case...

156
00:10:20,312 --> 00:10:23,147
...if there's a leak,
it's in Tony's boat.

157
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:28,069
If my nephew's in bed with
the Justice Department, just say it.

158
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:30,071
Don't stammer like a spastic.

159
00:10:30,322 --> 00:10:34,200
There's something fucking wrong with
that guy. I feel it in my gut.

160
00:10:34,493 --> 00:10:36,828
I'm worried about you, skipper.

161
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,706
I'm sorry, Mikey. You're a good boy.

162
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,835
Fuck this. I'm going to Boca.

163
00:10:44,587 --> 00:10:47,089
Deena, when you guys
showed up last year...

164
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,967
...I thought,
"Soccer, give me a break."

165
00:10:50,218 --> 00:10:53,929
But your dad makes it seem like
this, I don't know, metaphor.

166
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,764
- Yeah.
- Dad's pretty cool.

167
00:10:56,015 --> 00:10:58,934
Where's Al? She was supposed
to loan me a cig.

168
00:10:59,186 --> 00:11:00,728
I'll come with.

169
00:11:01,647 --> 00:11:03,106
Al?

170
00:11:03,315 --> 00:11:04,399
Ally!

171
00:11:05,901 --> 00:11:07,277
Al!

172
00:11:08,112 --> 00:11:11,114
If you're smoking,
you owe me $5!

173
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,118
- AI?
- Ally.

174
00:11:17,496 --> 00:11:18,788
Ally?

175
00:11:21,543 --> 00:11:23,335
Ally, what are you doing?

176
00:11:23,587 --> 00:11:25,296
Ally! Oh, my God!

177
00:11:29,467 --> 00:11:30,676
Her parents split up.

178
00:11:31,303 --> 00:11:33,304
So she's always at our house.

179
00:11:33,597 --> 00:11:37,516
- But she was born with a silver spoon.
- Teenagers are under a lot of stress.

180
00:11:37,726 --> 00:11:40,185
I know this kid. She's great.

181
00:11:40,437 --> 00:11:44,899
Was it a genuine suicide attempt?
Or was it a suicidal gesture?

182
00:11:46,235 --> 00:11:48,486
"Small cutting" is the clinical term.

183
00:11:48,696 --> 00:11:50,822
Is "large cutting"
O.J. in missing sweats?

184
00:11:51,073 --> 00:11:52,908
It's a cry for help.

185
00:11:55,828 --> 00:11:59,497
Her mother says she tried this before.

186
00:12:00,082 --> 00:12:01,625
A couple times.

187
00:12:03,669 --> 00:12:05,337
What else is going on?

188
00:12:05,588 --> 00:12:07,672
Life is putting the Prozac
to the test.

189
00:12:07,883 --> 00:12:10,217
It's all that business in the news?

190
00:12:10,677 --> 00:12:12,178
Let's talk about my daughter.

191
00:12:13,805 --> 00:12:15,848
Principal says girls in sports
do better.

192
00:12:16,016 --> 00:12:18,517
They don't take drugs
or get knocked up.

193
00:12:18,685 --> 00:12:20,603
But now this shit.

194
00:12:20,812 --> 00:12:23,689
If my daughter ever tried to
kill herself...

195
00:12:27,527 --> 00:12:29,111
Oh, God!

196
00:12:39,207 --> 00:12:41,667
Last week, I called you a whore.

197
00:12:41,918 --> 00:12:43,543
I might've been...

198
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,047
...overstating the case a little bit.

199
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:54,013
Ooh.

200
00:12:54,223 --> 00:12:55,431
Mr. Soprano.

201
00:12:55,724 --> 00:12:56,933
Miss Sanfillipo.

202
00:12:57,226 --> 00:12:58,685
A check for you to sign.

203
00:12:59,895 --> 00:13:01,396
Twenty grand?

204
00:13:01,605 --> 00:13:05,483
For research and development
into furthering the art and science...

205
00:13:05,693 --> 00:13:07,694
...of metal joint fittings.

206
00:13:07,945 --> 00:13:11,197
Where does our research
and development take us this time?

207
00:13:11,407 --> 00:13:13,700
Well, I was thinking Boca Raton.

208
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:15,576
My, my! You read my mind.

209
00:13:16,037 --> 00:13:17,162
I'm all packed.

210
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,581
I gotta talk to my cousin.

211
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,084
- Mr. Soprano?
- What?

212
00:13:22,377 --> 00:13:26,255
I was waiting to talk to Jerry
about how I could use some room...

213
00:13:26,464 --> 00:13:28,716
...on this mall job I got
in North Bergen.

214
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:31,885
Then I saw you here.
And I thought, what the hell...

215
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,596
...I may as well ask the man himself.

216
00:13:35,598 --> 00:13:39,476
Let's you and I meet. I can pass
my recommends on to my cousin.

217
00:13:42,606 --> 00:13:44,607
Mama Livia, how are you?

218
00:13:44,817 --> 00:13:49,029
- Do you remember me? Larry Boy Barese.
- I know who you are.

219
00:13:49,238 --> 00:13:52,907
You lit an apartment house on fire...

220
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,494
...and scared your mother
half to death.

221
00:13:56,746 --> 00:13:58,872
Mama's moving in here on the 15th.

222
00:13:59,123 --> 00:14:01,541
Yeah? Ooh, I like your shoes.

223
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:05,463
Mama hasn't been well. Last week
she threw a jar of artichokes at me.

224
00:14:05,756 --> 00:14:08,215
She better not throw any
artichokes at me.

225
00:14:09,217 --> 00:14:11,260
How are you doing? Remember Larry?

226
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,220
Water under the bridge.

227
00:14:14,097 --> 00:14:15,765
We're gonna take a walk.

228
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:18,809
You should get some shoes like his.

229
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:24,023
You've always been a genius.
But this last move is the best.

230
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:26,693
The feds'll never surveil
an old folks' home.

231
00:14:26,903 --> 00:14:30,489
That's why I got truckloads
of bootleg Polident coming in.

232
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,657
- There he is.
- How you doing?

233
00:14:32,825 --> 00:14:34,993
Did you get your mother
settled in yet?

234
00:14:35,286 --> 00:14:39,331
They're not sure they can accept her.
They want to see my finances again.

235
00:14:39,499 --> 00:14:43,502
So this office supply chain from
Virginia. What's the deal on them?

236
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:47,923
I spoke to them. I think they'll
listen to reason on minority hiring.

237
00:14:49,802 --> 00:14:52,178
- Been to any games?
- What do they got?

238
00:15:03,148 --> 00:15:04,357
What the fuck?

239
00:15:05,651 --> 00:15:07,819
Hup! Hup! Hup!

240
00:15:10,281 --> 00:15:12,157
Knees high, Colgiavani!

241
00:15:12,408 --> 00:15:15,702
Eyes ahead!
Energy, girls, energy!

242
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:19,790
I know we're all upset,
but we still have a season left.

243
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,167
- Come on, let's go!
- Hey, coach.

244
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:25,254
Fellas, sorry, but practice
is closed today.

245
00:15:25,463 --> 00:15:27,381
I'm trying to keep
the team focused.

246
00:15:28,007 --> 00:15:29,466
What are you doing?

247
00:15:29,717 --> 00:15:33,262
You're leaving us?
After two fucking years?

248
00:15:33,472 --> 00:15:37,016
I told that reporter to wait
before he put that in the paper.

249
00:15:37,268 --> 00:15:40,478
Coach, look at my little girl
out there.

250
00:15:41,063 --> 00:15:42,647
You're breaking her heart!

251
00:15:42,857 --> 00:15:46,734
Believe me, Art.
I am hugely conflicted.

252
00:15:46,902 --> 00:15:49,237
But Rhode Island doubled my salary!

253
00:15:49,446 --> 00:15:53,199
They're giving my daughter a full ride!
What could I do?

254
00:15:53,701 --> 00:15:55,493
They made an offer I couldn't refuse.

255
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,830
- You haven't heard ours.
- Come on.

256
00:15:58,081 --> 00:15:59,874
Look, I got a family too.

257
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,585
I have a daughter who loves
playing soccer.

258
00:16:02,794 --> 00:16:04,461
He's kidding about the offer.

259
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:08,632
Hey, nobody blew a whistle!

260
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,468
Let's not get lazy out here!
Come on!

261
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,596
Go fuck yourself.

262
00:16:14,097 --> 00:16:15,264
Excuse me?

263
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,766
- Want me to tell your dad?
- It's my field.

264
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,064
Give me 10 laps around the goals.

265
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,025
- Whatever.
- Make that 20.

266
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,611
Anybody else want to mouth off?

267
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,033
Good! Come on!
Let's circle up for keep-away.

268
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:34,618
Let's go! Over here.

269
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,495
Get in a big circle!
Go! Move it!

270
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:42,000
I need some people out here.
Come on! Let's go!

271
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,474
Give me your glass.

272
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:01,938
Who'd think we could be
this contented?

273
00:17:02,774 --> 00:17:05,859
I did. As soon as I
saw you, I knew.

274
00:17:06,152 --> 00:17:08,445
You're a sweetheart.

275
00:17:08,738 --> 00:17:12,366
If only they knew
the other side of you.

276
00:17:12,617 --> 00:17:14,618
They'd eat me for breakfast.

277
00:17:15,662 --> 00:17:19,206
I been looking at real estate.
Some nice houses on the market.

278
00:17:19,457 --> 00:17:21,458
Maybe you'd like something bigger?

279
00:17:22,043 --> 00:17:25,379
No, Corrado. This is our place.

280
00:17:25,631 --> 00:17:28,049
You know how long we been
coming here?

281
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,386
Sixteen years.
And every one of them good.

282
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,265
How's junior, Junior?

283
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,853
He's catching some shuteye.

284
00:17:41,063 --> 00:17:43,856
You're such a powerhouse.

285
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:46,859
When you kiss me down there...

286
00:17:47,027 --> 00:17:49,529
...you're like a great artist.

287
00:17:50,198 --> 00:17:53,075
You got a real instinct for it.

288
00:17:54,661 --> 00:17:56,245
Pass me the red peppers.

289
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:10,259
You know the thrill you give?

290
00:18:12,555 --> 00:18:14,222
Keep it to yourself, okay?

291
00:18:14,432 --> 00:18:18,059
Yeah. All to myself.

292
00:18:26,402 --> 00:18:29,612
- Corrado?
- Yeah?

293
00:18:29,864 --> 00:18:31,740
Why the big secret?

294
00:18:31,991 --> 00:18:33,408
About what?

295
00:18:33,576 --> 00:18:35,910
Oral sex.

296
00:18:36,163 --> 00:18:40,249
What's so terrible about
pleasing a woman?

297
00:18:41,585 --> 00:18:43,419
You always have to talk about it.

298
00:18:43,628 --> 00:18:46,088
Well, I want to know why!

299
00:18:46,423 --> 00:18:47,798
It's complicated.

300
00:18:48,008 --> 00:18:50,968
Yeah. But why?

301
00:18:51,803 --> 00:18:52,970
Why?

302
00:18:53,221 --> 00:18:56,307
They think if you suck pussy,
you'll suck anything.

303
00:18:56,516 --> 00:18:57,808
You're kidding.

304
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:01,855
It's a sign of weakness. And possibly
a sign that you're a finocchio.

305
00:19:04,025 --> 00:19:05,400
A fag?

306
00:19:06,069 --> 00:19:08,111
That's ridiculous.

307
00:19:09,614 --> 00:19:12,449
How would the two even translate?

308
00:19:14,077 --> 00:19:17,662
What are you gonna do?
I don't make the rules.

309
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,794
It's no big lifestyle choice.

310
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:27,215
My aunts Quintima and Jemma, they got
money out earning on the street.

311
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:30,134
It's like being a banker.
You help people.

312
00:19:33,597 --> 00:19:36,265
Chiara cried when she heard
the coach was leaving.

313
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,017
You don't want to talk. Fine.

314
00:19:38,227 --> 00:19:40,812
I gotta pick up Carmela anyway.

315
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:44,899
Let me ask you a question:
Why does your wife hate me?

316
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,819
Charmaine doesn't hate you.

317
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:52,491
You lie like I play a horn.

318
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:54,118
What?

319
00:19:56,496 --> 00:20:00,666
Look at this facchino.
Wearing a cap in a nice restaurant.

320
00:20:03,628 --> 00:20:07,673
I hated that most when I had
my restaurant. It's values today.

321
00:20:08,134 --> 00:20:10,593
Standards are crumbling.

322
00:20:12,847 --> 00:20:16,141
Would it kill this coach to
stay until my kid graduates?

323
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,810
Then let him stay four years
for Chiara.

324
00:20:23,858 --> 00:20:25,358
That burns my ass.

325
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:28,820
Where you going?

326
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:36,203
Take your hat off.

327
00:20:36,455 --> 00:20:37,538
Excuse me?

328
00:20:37,831 --> 00:20:40,875
They don't sell hot dogs.
They took the bleachers out.

329
00:20:41,209 --> 00:20:43,127
I'll wear it where I want.

330
00:21:00,396 --> 00:21:01,396
How you doing?

331
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,117
Thank you.

332
00:21:14,661 --> 00:21:15,828
Look at him.

333
00:21:16,914 --> 00:21:18,623
Douche bag. Good for you!

334
00:21:20,667 --> 00:21:23,085
Send them a bottle
of Montepulciano.

335
00:21:23,295 --> 00:21:26,923
Get the license plate of these
two guys sitting behind Artie.

336
00:21:27,216 --> 00:21:29,217
They look like cops.

337
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:49,112
Well, look who's here! Hi!

338
00:21:51,074 --> 00:21:53,951
- Tony, look who's here.
- Alphonse, how you doing?

339
00:21:54,452 --> 00:21:55,869
- Good.
- You feeling better?

340
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:57,079
Yeah.

341
00:22:00,292 --> 00:22:02,418
Gonna miss that left foot of yours.

342
00:22:02,628 --> 00:22:04,671
No. It's okay, Mr. Soprano.

343
00:22:05,089 --> 00:22:06,589
- I'm gonna play.
- No shit?

344
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,383
Pardon my French there.

345
00:22:08,634 --> 00:22:10,051
Are you sure, Ally?

346
00:22:10,469 --> 00:22:14,097
I had a long talk
with Coach Hauser and...

347
00:22:17,142 --> 00:22:18,851
I'm gonna play. That's all.

348
00:22:19,311 --> 00:22:20,937
I told her she didn't have to.

349
00:22:21,146 --> 00:22:22,939
She just said she wanted to.

350
00:22:24,734 --> 00:22:25,818
Yeah.

351
00:22:25,986 --> 00:22:28,612
- Coach pressure you?
- No, Mrs. Soprano.

352
00:22:28,822 --> 00:22:30,197
He would never do that.

353
00:22:30,448 --> 00:22:33,158
Pressure her? He doesn't
finish what he started.

354
00:22:33,326 --> 00:22:34,827
- Dad!
- What?

355
00:22:36,663 --> 00:22:38,497
It's what we all wanted.

356
00:22:41,251 --> 00:22:43,168
Okay. Right?

357
00:22:43,336 --> 00:22:44,837
As long as everything's...

358
00:22:45,005 --> 00:22:47,506
We're trying to watch this, okay?

359
00:22:48,884 --> 00:22:50,635
Kick ass, girls, right?

360
00:22:51,304 --> 00:22:52,512
Good night.

361
00:23:14,328 --> 00:23:17,246
Listen, Roberta,
what I said earlier?

362
00:23:18,915 --> 00:23:23,044
I'm serious, you discuss that
with anyone, we're gonna go 10 rounds.

363
00:23:23,253 --> 00:23:26,005
We just skimmed 20,000
off the development fund...

364
00:23:26,256 --> 00:23:29,008
...and you're worried about
a little lecca fica?

365
00:23:29,217 --> 00:23:31,802
- Will you keep it down?
- All right.

366
00:23:32,138 --> 00:23:36,224
I'll tell everyone you're a good
kisser. I just won't say where.

367
00:23:36,726 --> 00:23:39,227
That's my reputation you're
playing with.

368
00:23:39,437 --> 00:23:42,856
Honey, my lips are sealed.

369
00:23:44,108 --> 00:23:46,026
Not too sealed, right?

370
00:23:48,154 --> 00:23:52,032
Visual on Corrado Soprano
and female travel companion...

371
00:23:52,241 --> 00:23:55,744
...2200 hours, Boca Lounge.

372
00:24:10,386 --> 00:24:12,303
How's my boy today?

373
00:24:12,596 --> 00:24:14,097
Go, go, go!

374
00:24:17,102 --> 00:24:18,894
I'm looking for a Coach Hauser.

375
00:24:19,104 --> 00:24:21,897
That's me.
Petey! Come here!

376
00:24:23,316 --> 00:24:25,984
Something from your friends
at the Bada Bing.

377
00:24:26,277 --> 00:24:30,656
Brand-new, surround sound,
HDTV compatible.

378
00:24:30,865 --> 00:24:33,659
- Tell them thanks, but...
- This is getting heavy.

379
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:37,329
If this is about Rhode Island,
tell them I already signed.

380
00:24:37,872 --> 00:24:41,458
I don't know what it's about.
But the TV stays here. Put it down.

381
00:24:43,129 --> 00:24:44,546
No! I mean it!

382
00:24:44,755 --> 00:24:47,132
Pick it up! Get it off my property!

383
00:24:47,466 --> 00:24:50,301
Look, pal, I don't think you
quite understand.

384
00:24:50,553 --> 00:24:52,470
I understand, only too well.

385
00:24:52,722 --> 00:24:54,889
Tell your friends I know
all about them.

386
00:24:55,349 --> 00:24:57,434
If you did, you'd do what they want.

387
00:24:58,144 --> 00:24:59,936
Is that a threat?

388
00:25:00,146 --> 00:25:02,647
How things change.
Let me tell you, Guido...

389
00:25:02,858 --> 00:25:03,858
I'm Clarence.

390
00:25:04,067 --> 00:25:07,862
I have friends in law enforcement,
and they'd call this extortion.

391
00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:10,281
Come on.

392
00:25:13,368 --> 00:25:18,080
You tell those assholes
Don Hauser will not be intimidated!

393
00:25:18,373 --> 00:25:21,125
I will not be threatened or bribed!

394
00:25:21,376 --> 00:25:24,211
I go where I want to
when I want to!

395
00:25:27,216 --> 00:25:28,675
Hey!

396
00:25:31,512 --> 00:25:35,098
All day, every day,
85 and not one drop of rain.

397
00:25:35,516 --> 00:25:36,892
And those nights.

398
00:25:37,143 --> 00:25:40,854
Bobbi, you are so lucky
with this guy. You have no idea.

399
00:25:41,105 --> 00:25:43,231
He's a sweetheart underneath it all.

400
00:25:43,483 --> 00:25:46,109
I wish I could get Lou to
be like him.

401
00:25:46,402 --> 00:25:48,653
More sensitive,
if you know what I mean.

402
00:25:48,864 --> 00:25:50,281
That coral looks good.

403
00:25:50,532 --> 00:25:55,077
I don't understand why I always
have to ask him for oral sex.

404
00:25:55,871 --> 00:25:58,456
Not like you and your Corrado.

405
00:25:58,665 --> 00:26:03,002
Bebe, listen, I know we always used to
yak about our sex lives.

406
00:26:03,212 --> 00:26:06,214
I think it would be better
if we didn't anymore.

407
00:26:07,382 --> 00:26:08,674
- Okay.
- I mean it.

408
00:26:08,884 --> 00:26:10,051
Sure!

409
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,512
Just, you're lucky, that's all.

410
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,896
So, Ma, you coming to the game?

411
00:26:21,105 --> 00:26:22,856
Game? What game?

412
00:26:23,066 --> 00:26:25,609
Meadow's team is going to
the sectionals.

413
00:26:25,902 --> 00:26:27,402
Nobody tells me anything.

414
00:26:28,071 --> 00:26:30,072
Did everybody hear me just tell her?

415
00:26:30,907 --> 00:26:33,700
Can anybody think of anything
else to talk about?

416
00:26:34,703 --> 00:26:37,580
All right. Uncle Jun, how was Boca?

417
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,500
Wonderful. I don't go down enough.

418
00:26:40,793 --> 00:26:42,752
That's not what I heard.

419
00:26:44,129 --> 00:26:45,255
About what?

420
00:26:48,259 --> 00:26:50,635
I don't know what I'm talking about.

421
00:26:50,928 --> 00:26:53,054
Last time, Aunt Bobbi
bought me a piranha.

422
00:26:53,264 --> 00:26:54,764
A piranha? Come on!

423
00:26:54,932 --> 00:26:57,433
That woman is not your aunt.

424
00:26:57,644 --> 00:27:00,771
Livia, I warned you.
Bobbi is a sweet, sweet girl.

425
00:27:03,984 --> 00:27:05,025
What's the matter?

426
00:27:05,235 --> 00:27:06,443
What did I say?

427
00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:10,197
This wife of yours,
she's got the giggles.

428
00:27:11,032 --> 00:27:13,450
- Can I be excused?
- We just sat down!

429
00:27:13,618 --> 00:27:16,787
- How can you play if you don't eat?
- You need protein.

430
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:19,999
- No, I don't, because I quit.
- You quit?

431
00:27:20,293 --> 00:27:22,878
With Ally back,
you can go to the states.

432
00:27:23,087 --> 00:27:25,630
She slits her wrists,
and you think of a game?

433
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,426
It wasn't like Cobain.
It was just a little suicidal gesture.

434
00:27:30,928 --> 00:27:33,263
- Come back here!
- You're not excused!

435
00:27:33,514 --> 00:27:35,849
Let her go. Go ahead, honey!

436
00:27:36,058 --> 00:27:37,726
- Ma!
- Why don't you butt out?

437
00:27:37,935 --> 00:27:40,854
You only act nice when
you want to score points.

438
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,235
I will not eat in this house.

439
00:27:46,486 --> 00:27:48,321
Junior, take me home.

440
00:27:49,072 --> 00:27:51,657
- I'm not finished.
- She'll come back.

441
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:00,374
Stukas and Messerschmitts,
they have command of the skies.

442
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,176
I don't know.

443
00:28:09,677 --> 00:28:11,470
I'm glad Meadow quit.

444
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,223
That coach pushes them to
the brink. It's unhealthy.

445
00:28:15,892 --> 00:28:17,893
What do we mean when we
say commitment?

446
00:28:18,603 --> 00:28:20,520
He thinks he can just walk away.

447
00:28:20,813 --> 00:28:22,481
Watch it, cowboy, don't start.

448
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:28,612
- What's with you and Uncle Jun?
- Don't bother that coach.

449
00:28:29,031 --> 00:28:32,283
- Come on. Tell me about Uncle Jun.
- No, stop it!

450
00:28:32,493 --> 00:28:33,868
I can't!

451
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:36,496
- Yes, you can.
- All right. Okay.

452
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:44,253
Gabby Dante's cousin and Bobbi
go to the same nail parlor.

453
00:28:46,131 --> 00:28:49,676
And your uncle...
No, I shouldn't say. I shouldn't!

454
00:28:50,219 --> 00:28:52,428
- Come on.
- Okay, okay, okay.

455
00:28:55,725 --> 00:28:58,644
Well, let's just say...

456
00:28:58,895 --> 00:29:03,232
...your uncle has acquired
a taste for her.

457
00:29:04,067 --> 00:29:05,401
Uncle Jun gives head?

458
00:29:06,069 --> 00:29:07,069
World-class.

459
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:10,948
- He whistles to the wheat field?
- Don't be disgusting.

460
00:29:11,241 --> 00:29:14,618
- He's a bushman of the Kalahari!
- That's why I don't tell you.

461
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,663
You don't know when to stop!

462
00:29:16,914 --> 00:29:18,873
My God, if this ever gets out...

463
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:22,085
Yeah, like you don't do it.
Or any of your friends.

464
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,254
Bunch of hypocrites.

465
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:28,425
What goes on in this bedroom
stays here, and you know that.

466
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:33,096
Once a year?
I can resist the urge to gossip.

467
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:47,319
Arthur? You're home?

468
00:29:47,612 --> 00:29:49,739
The grease in that Frialator.

469
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,783
I'm gonna smell like
a cheap French fry forever.

470
00:29:53,118 --> 00:29:57,121
So this is why we scrimp and save
to send our kids to that school?

471
00:29:57,456 --> 00:29:59,874
So our name is dragged
through the mud?

472
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:01,460
What?

473
00:30:01,627 --> 00:30:04,129
Shelly Hauser called me
this afternoon.

474
00:30:04,338 --> 00:30:08,300
Your friend sent some Y.O.'s
down there with a stolen TV set...

475
00:30:08,509 --> 00:30:10,343
...to try and bribe the coach.

476
00:30:10,636 --> 00:30:12,888
From your friends at Bada Bing!

477
00:30:13,139 --> 00:30:18,143
As if a TV set is gonna get somewhere
with a man like Coach Hauser.

478
00:30:18,352 --> 00:30:19,895
A TV set?

479
00:30:20,146 --> 00:30:24,483
Do you honestly believe
that they're gonna stop there?

480
00:30:24,693 --> 00:30:27,320
They tried bribing this man.

481
00:30:27,863 --> 00:30:28,946
What's next?

482
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:33,743
- Always with the extreme scenarios.
- No, come on. Tell me, what's next?

483
00:30:33,952 --> 00:30:35,369
You grew up here.

484
00:30:35,662 --> 00:30:39,832
Don't pretend like you don't know
what Tony Soprano is capable of.

485
00:30:42,294 --> 00:30:43,503
Who is it?

486
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,921
I found your dog.

487
00:30:52,514 --> 00:30:53,931
What?

488
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,350
No, you're mistaken.
My dog is upstairs.

489
00:30:56,518 --> 00:30:59,353
Golden Retriever, blue nylon collar?

490
00:30:59,521 --> 00:31:01,021
Honey, who is it?

491
00:31:01,272 --> 00:31:02,272
Evening, ma'am.

492
00:31:05,026 --> 00:31:07,152
He has our dog.

493
00:31:07,446 --> 00:31:08,738
Where is Petey?

494
00:31:08,948 --> 00:31:10,740
- He was locked in.
- Come get him.

495
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:13,243
I wouldn't want Petey
to get hit by a car.

496
00:31:30,887 --> 00:31:33,055
Petey, Petey!

497
00:31:33,306 --> 00:31:34,682
You okay? Come here.

498
00:31:34,891 --> 00:31:36,725
What, no reward?

499
00:31:37,978 --> 00:31:40,688
Just kidding. I'm an animal lover.

500
00:31:42,983 --> 00:31:44,066
You okay, boy?

501
00:31:45,068 --> 00:31:47,069
Med, cheer up about the coach...

502
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,072
...because I feel he'll
reconsider the big move.

503
00:31:50,323 --> 00:31:51,699
Tony.

504
00:31:51,908 --> 00:31:53,367
Did you do something?

505
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,078
What could I do?

506
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:58,999
He's gonna stick around and finish
what he started with the girls.

507
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,085
That's it.

508
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,921
Well, did I tell you?

509
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:14,347
Develop some appreciation,
because everyone helps you...

510
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,892
...and all you do is bitch and moan!

511
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:21,272
This coach abandons his team,
and your friends get all worked up.

512
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,940
So I try to do something.

513
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,067
Is that why you think we're upset?

514
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:28,946
Because a coach who most of us
can't even stand is leaving?

515
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:32,658
You don't have to love him
to be successful.

516
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,619
"Catfish" Hunter hated Billy Martin.

517
00:32:34,912 --> 00:32:38,164
Bill Parcells' guys can't stand him,
till they start to win.

518
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,750
Coach Hauser had sex with Ally.

519
00:32:42,295 --> 00:32:43,295
What?

520
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:47,966
That's why she cut herself. That's
why I've been living at her house.

521
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:51,720
All right, hold on a minute.

522
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:53,180
Maybe...

523
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:57,517
With Ally?

524
00:32:58,269 --> 00:32:59,728
Meadow, this is horrible.

525
00:33:00,271 --> 00:33:03,982
This is also a serious accusation.
What exactly did Ally say?

526
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:07,237
That they had sex, more than once...

527
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:09,614
...that she's not a virgin anymore!

528
00:33:12,493 --> 00:33:13,660
All right.

529
00:33:14,954 --> 00:33:17,247
Ally's a very pretty girl.

530
00:33:17,498 --> 00:33:18,915
Maybe there was...

531
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:21,834
Maybe there was confusion.
Maybe she wanted to...

532
00:33:22,086 --> 00:33:24,671
- ...look like she was sophisticated.
- Dad!

533
00:33:27,133 --> 00:33:30,678
- What?
- Tony, what if this had been Meadow?

534
00:33:31,096 --> 00:33:32,846
What kind of confusion?

535
00:33:33,056 --> 00:33:36,058
At her age? The coach shouldn't
have been in any position...

536
00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:39,770
...where there's even a remote
possibility of confusion!

537
00:33:41,189 --> 00:33:42,898
I'm losing my mind here.

538
00:33:43,108 --> 00:33:45,234
Go downstairs
so me and Meadow can talk.

539
00:33:45,485 --> 00:33:47,528
Jesus fucking Christ!

540
00:33:49,699 --> 00:33:51,283
God, now what did I do?

541
00:33:52,326 --> 00:33:55,453
I only told so he wouldn't make
Coach Hauser stay.

542
00:33:55,663 --> 00:33:58,999
Meadow, this is a horrible,
horrible thing.

543
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:02,419
She's in love with him.
But he won't leave his wife.

544
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:05,213
Leave his wife? Meadow!

545
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,135
- Now, he didn't touch you, right?
- No.

546
00:34:11,054 --> 00:34:12,096
What about Deena?

547
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:14,932
If she hears about her father,
it'll destroy her.

548
00:34:15,225 --> 00:34:18,102
Tell Dad to let him go
anywhere he wants, okay?

549
00:34:18,395 --> 00:34:20,021
Come here.

550
00:34:27,654 --> 00:34:30,156
Moldonado and his brother,
they'll handle it.

551
00:34:31,241 --> 00:34:33,075
Mol owes me a solid.

552
00:34:34,037 --> 00:34:37,664
No. No hired help.
This is personal.

553
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:40,250
I'm glad to hear you say that.

554
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:43,086
I'm gonna give him
a real after-school special.

555
00:34:46,924 --> 00:34:48,967
- You out of your mind?
- What?

556
00:34:49,761 --> 00:34:53,680
You kidnapped the coach's dog.
But if you do one more thing...

557
00:34:53,931 --> 00:34:57,476
Shut up, Arthur. You're five
time zones behind your own ass.

558
00:34:57,686 --> 00:35:00,980
No, I'm fucking serious.
You hear me, Tony?

559
00:35:02,441 --> 00:35:03,441
You're serious?

560
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:04,984
Want to hear serious?

561
00:35:05,235 --> 00:35:07,278
Want to know what your coach did?

562
00:35:07,446 --> 00:35:12,033
He fucked little Ally Vandermeed
and who knows who else he fucked.

563
00:35:12,618 --> 00:35:14,660
What are you talking about?
Fucked?

564
00:35:17,956 --> 00:35:18,998
That's crazy.

565
00:35:19,459 --> 00:35:21,835
That's why that kid slit her wrist.

566
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:23,670
And my daughter should know?

567
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,840
She should have to think
about that filth?

568
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,468
- No.
- No?

569
00:35:29,677 --> 00:35:31,845
That self-righteous prick
put his dick...

570
00:35:32,097 --> 00:35:35,015
...in my little girl's soccer teammate.

571
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:38,310
Yeah. She's in 11th grade,
for chrissake!

572
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,520
Oh, my God.

573
00:35:41,148 --> 00:35:44,484
Chiara. He drove her home
one night when it was raining.

574
00:35:44,819 --> 00:35:46,152
Oh, my little girl.

575
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,322
- Degenerate son of a bitch.
- He deserves to die!

576
00:35:50,658 --> 00:35:51,866
Betraying children?

577
00:35:52,076 --> 00:35:55,161
Believe me, he ain't gonna be doing
that shit no more.

578
00:35:55,496 --> 00:35:57,539
I guarantee you that.

579
00:36:17,686 --> 00:36:20,187
Nobody said to put my nephew
under surveillance.

580
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:23,065
I know, Junior. I know.

581
00:36:23,483 --> 00:36:26,318
I wanted to be safe
and I'm glad I was.

582
00:36:26,611 --> 00:36:29,613
Because your nephew isn't just
at that titty bar...

583
00:36:29,866 --> 00:36:31,658
...and going to soccer games.

584
00:36:31,909 --> 00:36:33,118
Go ahead.

585
00:36:33,411 --> 00:36:37,080
Twice last week he goes toward
the medical center...

586
00:36:37,331 --> 00:36:38,540
...and they lose him.

587
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:40,167
A girlfriend.

588
00:36:40,418 --> 00:36:41,710
No, no, no.

589
00:36:41,919 --> 00:36:44,546
He's seeing this
Russian slit very open.

590
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:46,882
Your nephew is talking to the feds.

591
00:36:47,091 --> 00:36:50,844
Where else would he be going
that requires such precautions?

592
00:36:51,054 --> 00:36:53,723
What the fuck else
would be the big secret?

593
00:36:53,932 --> 00:36:55,850
What am I, a swami?

594
00:36:57,478 --> 00:36:58,853
Hey!

595
00:36:59,938 --> 00:37:00,980
- Silvio!
- Mikey!

596
00:37:01,231 --> 00:37:04,066
How you doing?
You're looking good.

597
00:37:04,401 --> 00:37:05,776
How you feel?

598
00:37:09,907 --> 00:37:11,616
You shanked it, Sil.

599
00:37:11,909 --> 00:37:14,285
I still got the coach on my mind.

600
00:37:15,788 --> 00:37:19,583
We got fresh air, we got sunshine.
Forget about that shit.

601
00:37:19,792 --> 00:37:21,418
Thank God for golf some days.

602
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:23,670
I'm trying to concentrate here.

603
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,633
Did you get any golf in at Boca?

604
00:37:27,926 --> 00:37:30,093
Fucking manners, please!

605
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:37,267
You play Manatee,
or what's that other one?

606
00:37:37,478 --> 00:37:42,065
Will you let the man tee off?
You yap worse than six barbers!

607
00:37:42,441 --> 00:37:45,109
If you'd have shut up during
that Mountain Lakes game...

608
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:47,445
...you wouldn't have missed
that fly ball.

609
00:37:47,655 --> 00:37:49,656
I was ashamed to face my friends.

610
00:37:52,451 --> 00:37:54,327
Good, Mikey. Better.

611
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,037
What do you mean, better?

612
00:37:56,247 --> 00:37:58,957
Well, you know, it's better.

613
00:38:05,131 --> 00:38:06,799
Whoa, Junior!

614
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:08,968
Whoa, Junior, what?

615
00:38:09,928 --> 00:38:13,097
- Uncle Jun's into muff.
- What?

616
00:38:14,474 --> 00:38:17,393
Oh, did I say muff?
I meant ruff.

617
00:38:21,482 --> 00:38:22,524
Good shot.

618
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:28,822
What's that smell?
Did you guys go to a sushi bar?

619
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:31,533
- What's he talking about?
- I don't know.

620
00:38:31,826 --> 00:38:35,328
I thought you were a baccala man.
What are you doing eating sushi?

621
00:38:35,538 --> 00:38:38,206
You're fucking running off
at the mouth.

622
00:38:46,633 --> 00:38:47,842
Listen, my friend.

623
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:52,471
At least I can deal with
my own problems. Unlike some I know.

624
00:38:52,681 --> 00:38:53,723
What's that mean?

625
00:38:53,932 --> 00:38:56,434
Take it however you want.
Don't bullshit me.

626
00:38:56,852 --> 00:38:59,020
Guys, we here to play golf or what?

627
00:38:59,479 --> 00:39:00,688
Come on.

628
00:39:08,865 --> 00:39:10,032
Arthur...

629
00:39:12,368 --> 00:39:14,536
...everybody's just so upset.

630
00:39:14,787 --> 00:39:18,790
The mother's on sedatives.
She's completely unable to deal.

631
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,293
The father lives in Europe somewhere.

632
00:39:21,502 --> 00:39:24,838
The little girl, Ally, she thinks
it's all her fault.

633
00:39:25,298 --> 00:39:27,883
Bastard. He won't
get away with this!

634
00:39:28,134 --> 00:39:30,260
You got that right.

635
00:39:30,721 --> 00:39:31,929
What?

636
00:39:33,849 --> 00:39:36,351
Hand me that bottle
of Bug-B-Gon, will you?

637
00:39:36,602 --> 00:39:37,935
Arthur, what?

638
00:39:41,315 --> 00:39:43,316
Something going on, Artie?

639
00:39:45,402 --> 00:39:47,612
Your mobster friend
gonna do something?

640
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,534
If I had any balls,
I would do it myself.

641
00:39:53,828 --> 00:39:57,122
You do have balls.
That's why you're not like him.

642
00:39:57,374 --> 00:39:58,415
Fuck it.

643
00:39:59,042 --> 00:40:00,167
Fuck the world!

644
00:40:01,336 --> 00:40:03,420
This isn't making a slob
take his hat off.

645
00:40:03,672 --> 00:40:07,800
This is beating a man to death
or cutting his balls off, or what?

646
00:40:09,552 --> 00:40:11,595
You can't tell me
he doesn't deserve it!

647
00:40:12,597 --> 00:40:14,014
Okay, but...

648
00:40:14,557 --> 00:40:16,934
Listen, think about
what you're saying!

649
00:40:17,144 --> 00:40:18,853
Yeah, you tell me.

650
00:40:19,146 --> 00:40:22,649
Who's worse: Tony Soprano
or that child-molesting fuck?

651
00:40:23,442 --> 00:40:26,986
I trusted him. I'd like to
rip his heart out of his chest!

652
00:40:27,196 --> 00:40:30,782
Jesus Christ, I cannot believe
you only think about yourself!

653
00:40:31,075 --> 00:40:32,158
Myself?

654
00:40:33,285 --> 00:40:34,869
Myself?

655
00:40:35,621 --> 00:40:37,622
I resent that, Charmaine.

656
00:40:49,678 --> 00:40:52,638
Junior, what the fuck?
What's the matter?

657
00:40:54,474 --> 00:40:56,684
What? That bullshit with the sushi?

658
00:40:59,187 --> 00:41:02,982
No. I don't know what he
was talking about. He babbles.

659
00:41:03,651 --> 00:41:05,152
- What?
- You're another one!

660
00:41:05,361 --> 00:41:07,946
Me? He completely lacked respect.

661
00:41:08,156 --> 00:41:11,158
I'm tired of having to make
excuses for him.

662
00:41:11,325 --> 00:41:14,161
- It isn't right.
- Because he's a mental weakling.

663
00:41:14,328 --> 00:41:16,371
- I know.
- You don't know shit!

664
00:41:21,544 --> 00:41:23,795
He's seeing a psychiatrist.

665
00:41:24,047 --> 00:41:25,298
How about that?

666
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:29,677
My nephew is seeing a psychiatrist.
It makes me want to cry.

667
00:41:29,845 --> 00:41:30,845
No shit?

668
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:34,515
The indictment's being prepared.
He's spilling his guts!

669
00:41:34,767 --> 00:41:36,392
I fucking knew it.

670
00:41:36,643 --> 00:41:39,228
No, you didn't know it.
I just told you.

671
00:41:43,066 --> 00:41:45,860
God knows how much
of our family business he has.

672
00:41:46,028 --> 00:41:49,030
- If the place is bugged?
- That's not admissible.

673
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:53,869
It's that doctor-patient privilege.
Just like us and Melvoin.

674
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:57,039
Melvoin's a lawyer.
He's in the fucking ballpark.

675
00:41:57,207 --> 00:42:00,083
Suppose this shrink gets
scared or something?

676
00:42:00,376 --> 00:42:02,961
Remember those two brothers
in California?

677
00:42:03,213 --> 00:42:05,047
They whacked their parents?

678
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:07,174
The shrink was in a witness chair.

679
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:10,135
Shit.

680
00:42:13,474 --> 00:42:15,809
Anthony wants to play games, okay.

681
00:42:16,018 --> 00:42:17,769
I taught him games.

682
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,981
I taught him how to play baseball.

683
00:42:26,028 --> 00:42:27,612
Talking about clipping him?

684
00:42:27,822 --> 00:42:29,823
Nobody would slap my wrist if I did.

685
00:42:32,536 --> 00:42:34,662
Guys in prison have done
half the damage he has.

686
00:42:34,913 --> 00:42:38,666
The judicial system has improved
in dealing with sexual predators.

687
00:42:38,875 --> 00:42:40,668
Oh, yeah. Let's impeach him.

688
00:42:40,877 --> 00:42:43,295
If you're telling me of intent
to harm him...

689
00:42:43,588 --> 00:42:46,715
...I must warn you of my duty to
alert law enforcement.

690
00:42:46,925 --> 00:42:48,300
Why do I tell you anything?

691
00:42:48,593 --> 00:42:53,097
I'm interested in why you feel
punishing this man falls upon you.

692
00:42:53,306 --> 00:42:55,391
- It doesn't fall upon you.
- What?

693
00:42:55,643 --> 00:42:57,686
What would you do?
You'd call the cops...

694
00:42:57,895 --> 00:43:00,522
...who'd get some judge,
who'd give him counseling...

695
00:43:00,773 --> 00:43:05,235
...to talk about his unhappy childhood,
and we could have sympathy for him.

696
00:43:05,444 --> 00:43:07,445
Because he's the victim, right?

697
00:43:07,613 --> 00:43:10,323
You know what you do?
You ignore the truth.

698
00:43:10,533 --> 00:43:12,742
Discredit psychology all you want.

699
00:43:13,035 --> 00:43:17,414
But I continue to ask the question.
Why do you think you...

700
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:20,918
...always have to set things right?

701
00:43:29,219 --> 00:43:31,470
Hey, Paulie, is Tony in?

702
00:43:31,722 --> 00:43:33,014
- Tony?
- Artie.

703
00:43:33,265 --> 00:43:34,557
I got to talk to you.

704
00:43:34,766 --> 00:43:35,892
I'm busy right now.

705
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,685
I got to talk to you.

706
00:43:39,313 --> 00:43:42,481
All right. We'll finish
later, all right?

707
00:43:54,662 --> 00:43:56,079
Come on in.

708
00:44:03,505 --> 00:44:07,717
It's about the thing.

709
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:09,093
You know what?

710
00:44:10,179 --> 00:44:14,599
- Nothing's happened yet, has it?
- Just got to make the call.

711
00:44:15,225 --> 00:44:18,019
- I'm savoring the moment.
- Call it off.

712
00:44:18,354 --> 00:44:20,396
Don't worry about it.

713
00:44:20,648 --> 00:44:21,898
You don't go near this.

714
00:44:22,191 --> 00:44:24,859
I don't care about that.
It's wrong, Tony.

715
00:44:25,527 --> 00:44:28,696
- You can't do it.
- It's wrong?

716
00:44:28,907 --> 00:44:30,032
What he did isn't?

717
00:44:30,408 --> 00:44:32,534
I'm begging you.
I hate the guy too.

718
00:44:34,245 --> 00:44:35,496
What do you want to do?

719
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,249
Want to call the cops?
Here's the phone.

720
00:44:40,752 --> 00:44:41,752
They'll arrest him.

721
00:44:42,253 --> 00:44:44,880
And he'll get out in two
years and move north.

722
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:46,215
And then?

723
00:44:46,424 --> 00:44:48,926
He'll teach girls' soccer
and start all over.

724
00:44:49,136 --> 00:44:52,889
You don't think I want to rip him
apart like a chicken?

725
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:56,851
I drove by his house.
I almost got out.

726
00:44:58,062 --> 00:44:59,062
But you didn't.

727
00:44:59,855 --> 00:45:02,065
Something happens to him,
who does it help?

728
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,068
His daughter? That girl?

729
00:45:05,319 --> 00:45:06,695
No. You, Tony.

730
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:12,033
And Silvio and me and whoever.
It's just gonna make us feel better.

731
00:45:12,411 --> 00:45:16,914
So don't even think about calling this
justice. Leave it to the cops.

732
00:45:17,207 --> 00:45:19,250
Look, let me ask you a question.

733
00:45:19,501 --> 00:45:22,920
Who are you, coming in here
talking to me like this?!

734
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,049
Now, your boyfriend is finished.
You deal with it!

735
00:45:27,259 --> 00:45:28,259
Okay?

736
00:45:28,552 --> 00:45:30,761
Tony, don't do it.

737
00:45:31,013 --> 00:45:32,430
This is me asking you.

738
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:34,223
Why don't you get out?!

739
00:45:34,433 --> 00:45:35,808
Come on.

740
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,936
Get the fuck out, go!

741
00:45:38,104 --> 00:45:39,563
Let's go!

742
00:45:39,814 --> 00:45:41,440
Come on, come on!

743
00:47:00,689 --> 00:47:03,191
Corrado?

744
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,028
I was worried! You usually call
me when you're this late.

745
00:47:07,823 --> 00:47:12,618
I bought us some barbecued chicken,
salad and lemon meringue pie.

746
00:47:12,869 --> 00:47:14,537
But I got hungry and ate.

747
00:47:14,788 --> 00:47:16,872
Did I tell you to
keep your mouth shut?!

748
00:47:17,457 --> 00:47:20,417
Did I tell you to keep
your goddamn mouth shut?!

749
00:47:20,669 --> 00:47:22,086
Don't hit me!

750
00:47:39,814 --> 00:47:41,898
You stupid fucking blabbermouth cunt!

751
00:47:43,568 --> 00:47:45,402
I don't understand!

752
00:47:45,736 --> 00:47:50,115
Get your pencils and your crap
and don't be here tomorrow!

753
00:47:51,325 --> 00:47:53,160
No, Corrado. Don't leave.

754
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:55,496
I love you!

755
00:47:57,166 --> 00:47:59,500
I am so sorry!

756
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:01,878
No, Corrado!

757
00:48:23,276 --> 00:48:25,194
- Yeah?
- You there at the place?

758
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:26,653
Is he in the house?

759
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:29,781
Fuck it. Walk away.

760
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:31,658
Just walk away.
Don't do it.

761
00:48:31,868 --> 00:48:33,869
Fuck!

762
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:35,120
All right.

763
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:38,123
- Leave it alone.
- Yeah. No problem.

764
00:48:38,417 --> 00:48:41,211
Son of a bitch!

765
00:48:41,462 --> 00:48:44,547
Colleagues and neighbors were
shocked...

766
00:48:44,757 --> 00:48:47,550
...to hear of
charges brought against Hauser...

767
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,137
...coach of the Verbum Dei
high school girls' soccer team.

768
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:53,973
Alerted by a friend of
the alleged victim...

769
00:48:54,141 --> 00:48:56,643
...whose name cannot be revealed...

770
00:48:56,977 --> 00:48:59,479
...police issued a warrant
for his arrest.

771
00:49:10,784 --> 00:49:12,201
- Tony.
- Carmela.

772
00:49:13,828 --> 00:49:18,874
Tony, Jesus! You smell
like Lord Calvert.

773
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:25,632
Tony.

774
00:49:42,024 --> 00:49:43,858
What is with you tonight?

775
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:48,864
Tony, what is this?

776
00:49:50,492 --> 00:49:51,867
Jesus!

777
00:49:52,077 --> 00:49:53,452
Mixed with alcohol!

778
00:49:53,704 --> 00:49:56,539
Tony, that's wonderful.
Happy trails.

779
00:49:56,832 --> 00:49:58,374
Here, let's get you to bed.

780
00:49:58,959 --> 00:50:00,209
Carmela.

781
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:01,877
Carmela.

782
00:50:04,631 --> 00:50:06,048
I didn't hurt nobody.

783
00:50:19,897 --> 00:50:24,693
Call the shrink. Tell her the
town's gonna give her a fucking bonus.


1
00:01:43,564 --> 00:01:45,648
Talk it through the opening.

2
00:01:45,858 --> 00:01:48,151
A little left.
A little left on your end.

3
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,611
All right!

4
00:01:54,366 --> 00:01:55,366
Open the door.

5
00:01:55,534 --> 00:01:59,871
Any hinky shit, you'll be refrying
beans with Pablo Escobar again.

6
00:02:03,292 --> 00:02:07,212
This is all a message to your friends:
Stay away from Port Newark.

7
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,424
Don't even drive out to Jersey,
not even on Sundays.

8
00:02:11,634 --> 00:02:12,675
I'll tell them.

9
00:02:12,968 --> 00:02:17,055
They've been told. Twice.
Now I'll tell them.

10
00:02:19,642 --> 00:02:20,642
Here!

11
00:02:22,645 --> 00:02:24,354
Holy shit!

12
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:26,021
Bingo!

13
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:28,148
We can't fit it all!

14
00:02:28,358 --> 00:02:31,235
Fucking crackheads
and their small bills.

15
00:02:35,198 --> 00:02:39,326
This is a token of my appreciation,
for recommending Dr. Melfi.

16
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:42,037
She's a good shrink.
I'm not a model patient...

17
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:44,873
What? What? You didn't have to.

18
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:48,043
These are Montecristos.
These are Cuban.

19
00:02:48,294 --> 00:02:50,045
Yeah, they're the best, right?

20
00:02:50,255 --> 00:02:51,672
Aren't they illegal?

21
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:53,590
They're cigars.

22
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:58,387
- Oh, they're dreamy, Ton.
- You're a good neighbor, Bruce.

23
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:02,516
I'm a doctor. I make referrals
all the time. You don't have to...

24
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,186
- No biggie.
- I bet these were hard to come by.

25
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:07,854
They fell off a truck.

26
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:10,857
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

27
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:13,360
- Hello?
- It's done.

28
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:16,446
It's the biggest refrigerator
you've ever seen.

29
00:03:16,698 --> 00:03:17,698
And the other thing?

30
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:21,535
Juan Valdez has been separated
from his donkey.

31
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:29,751
You know, Ton, I been watching you
out back with your putter.

32
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:31,878
- You ever play at the club?
- No.

33
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,548
I play Minnisink, the public course.

34
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:38,552
You ought to come to the club
and play sometime.

35
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:42,389
- No, you know, it's...
- Come on! It's a wicked back nine.

36
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:45,891
Besides, I think you'd like
some of the members very much.

37
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,144
Yeah, maybe, you know...

38
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:49,770
We'll see.

39
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:51,731
Here we go.

40
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,276
- Fresh champagne, gentlemen.
- Oh, that's beautiful!

41
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:59,363
- I love a mixed salad.
- I could stare at it for hours.

42
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,949
A score like this happens
once in a lifetime.

43
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,410
Gotta make this work for us, legit.

44
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,580
Find a nice IPO, keep it spinning,
live off the juice.

45
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,166
- IP who?
- Tony!

46
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,459
Yeah, yeah?

47
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:15,755
IPO, Initial Public Offering, stock,
insider market trading shit.

48
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,257
- Where's my baby?
- Understand?

49
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,595
Paulie, baby. Get that big dick
in the Jacuzzi, now!

50
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,597
Ooh!

51
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,766
Taking off.

52
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:32,021
- Gonna celebrate, me and Adriana.
- Mother of mercy!

53
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,815
- Could this be the end of RICO?
- Maybe.

54
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,026
Just may be!

55
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,986
- Have fun!
- Say hello.

56
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,821
Say hello to your girl for me.

57
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:44,658
Thank you so much
for taking me to the theater.

58
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:49,163
Rent.
Fucking Broadway musicals.

59
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:54,460
We're supposed to be all weepy because
the heat's off in some guy's loft?

60
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,629
I'm humming the scenery, Chrissy!

61
00:04:56,838 --> 00:05:00,341
Fifth row center
and dinner at Le Cirque!

62
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,635
I'm embarrassed to be hungry again.

63
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,887
Thank you.

64
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,140
After how many years with
Tony Soprano's crew...

65
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,643
...some shit has finally worked out.

66
00:05:11,852 --> 00:05:15,980
Just when I was starting
to wonder if, you know...

67
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:19,776
Whose welfare check
you gotta cash to get a burger?

68
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:21,986
Hey, shut the fuck up!

69
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:25,532
Wouldn't it be cool to own
a restaurant like Le Cirque?

70
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,993
Madonna, with the careers.

71
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:32,247
The black guy over there,
he look familiar?

72
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,418
Why don't you just forget about
working and be with me?

73
00:05:36,585 --> 00:05:37,585
Oh, yeah.

74
00:05:37,753 --> 00:05:40,755
And be one of those wives
like Carmela Soprano:

75
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:46,052
Breast-feeding rug rats and spending
the rest of your life at the gym.

76
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:50,849
You're right. My cousin's always had
a brain, but what does she use it for?

77
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,060
With a husband who can't tell you
where the money's from.

78
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:58,064
- What am I back here, Mark Fuhrman?
- You're a dick, man!

79
00:05:58,357 --> 00:05:59,774
Chris, would you chill?

80
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,235
It's fucking discrimination, already!

81
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:03,695
Hey!

82
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,866
About time. Excuse me.

83
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:21,753
Bold men make bold statements.

84
00:06:22,046 --> 00:06:26,008
Why'd they send you? I'm looking
for a burger, not converted rice.

85
00:06:26,217 --> 00:06:27,384
Madonna.

86
00:06:28,052 --> 00:06:29,636
Your woman looks embarrassed.

87
00:06:33,558 --> 00:06:37,186
Give me a couple of burger baskets.

88
00:06:40,273 --> 00:06:44,443
He's only bold because he's semi-hooked
up with the Tony Soprano crew.

89
00:06:49,574 --> 00:06:54,036
What's with the attitude? If it's not
the blacks, it's somebody else.

90
00:06:54,245 --> 00:06:55,370
Whoa.

91
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,790
- Nice.
- Must be the homie with the blue hat.

92
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Yo!

93
00:07:00,251 --> 00:07:01,877
Donnie Brasco.

94
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,795
Yeah?

95
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,633
My name is Orange J.
I'm down with Massive Genius.

96
00:07:07,842 --> 00:07:10,552
That's who it was.
The gangsta rapper.

97
00:07:10,762 --> 00:07:12,638
I told you to shut up!

98
00:07:12,847 --> 00:07:17,351
We're having a party at G's crib.
Englewood Cliffs. You interested?

99
00:07:18,186 --> 00:07:22,439
And I get served with black-eyed peas
tomorrow? Yo, I know what time it is.

100
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:27,194
Massive's heard of the crew you with.
There's business to be done.

101
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:07,984
This is a beautiful, beautiful home.

102
00:08:08,235 --> 00:08:12,363
Smaller than my Hamptons crib,
but that's bigger than Steven's.

103
00:08:12,656 --> 00:08:15,032
It's Italian contractors obviously.

104
00:08:15,242 --> 00:08:17,410
Look at all these gold records!

105
00:08:18,745 --> 00:08:19,745
Whoa.

106
00:08:20,747 --> 00:08:22,415
What do we have here?

107
00:08:28,255 --> 00:08:30,172
You like that shit?

108
00:08:32,092 --> 00:08:34,552
A little Christmas present to myself.

109
00:08:35,846 --> 00:08:38,055
Isn't that a sight to behold?

110
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:43,686
I do so love a good firearm
in my hand.

111
00:08:53,947 --> 00:08:55,573
You people are all right.

112
00:08:56,658 --> 00:08:59,702
Godfather,
I seen that movie 200 times.

113
00:09:00,286 --> 00:09:02,871
Godfather II was
definitely the shit!

114
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:04,956
The third one...

115
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:09,377
...a lot of people didn't like it,
but I think it was just misunderstood.

116
00:09:12,673 --> 00:09:14,883
So what business you want to discuss?

117
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,354
- Mr. Herman Rabkin.
- Hesh.

118
00:09:27,563 --> 00:09:30,357
I don't know him personally,
but I know his history.

119
00:09:30,608 --> 00:09:33,777
In the late '50s and '60s,
he owned F-Note Records.

120
00:09:34,028 --> 00:09:37,197
Yeah, Hesh was in the music business.

121
00:09:37,406 --> 00:09:39,032
Little situation here.

122
00:09:39,283 --> 00:09:44,037
My mother's deceased distant cousin,
Little Jimmy Willis, '50s legend.

123
00:09:44,246 --> 00:09:46,623
Two seminal hit records
was his legacy.

124
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,792
Drug tragedy.

125
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:50,877
- "Such a Fool."
- Oh, I love that!

126
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,463
They play it all the time
on oldies radio.

127
00:09:53,673 --> 00:09:54,756
Old Herman?

128
00:09:55,007 --> 00:09:58,843
He's just another white motherfucker
stealing royalties...

129
00:09:59,095 --> 00:10:01,513
...from the black man
that made him the money.

130
00:10:01,972 --> 00:10:06,601
Jimmy's mother, who I'm content to
call my aunt, is owed that money.

131
00:10:08,646 --> 00:10:13,400
Hesh is the sweetest guy. But I know
his opinion on giving back Israel.

132
00:10:13,651 --> 00:10:16,486
I can only imagine what
he'll say about this shit.

133
00:10:16,986 --> 00:10:21,365
Feel free to enjoy the food
and any other enjoyments.

134
00:10:24,869 --> 00:10:28,247
- Champagne, sir. Ma'am?
- Yeah.

135
00:10:33,378 --> 00:10:36,505
That guy's a gangsta?
I'm a gangsta.

136
00:10:36,798 --> 00:10:40,634
I'm an OG, original gangsta.
Not him, fucking lawn jockey.

137
00:10:40,802 --> 00:10:43,637
But he's got the fly Hamptons house.

138
00:10:43,805 --> 00:10:48,183
Alec Baldwin comes over.
Whitney Houston. What do I got?

139
00:10:48,476 --> 00:10:50,769
I sit in a fucking pork store,
for chrissake.

140
00:10:51,104 --> 00:10:54,481
But the moolies, they got it
going on. And they're on TV.

141
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:56,483
They don't take no shit.

142
00:10:56,693 --> 00:11:01,113
Soprano crew, it's always secret this,
omertá that. Gets on my nerves.

143
00:11:01,322 --> 00:11:04,199
Junior with his moldy sweaters,
and he's a fucking boss.

144
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,203
You were just feeling
so good about yourself.

145
00:11:08,621 --> 00:11:11,373
Our thing once ruled the music
business, did you know?

146
00:11:11,624 --> 00:11:15,335
- No.
- We bankrolled acts, blacks, everybody.

147
00:11:15,628 --> 00:11:18,589
Paid the DJs or busted heads
to get them played on the air.

148
00:11:18,798 --> 00:11:20,674
There were great Italian singers.

149
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:25,846
Fucking A. Frankie Valli, Dion,
The Rascals, the whole Philly thing.

150
00:11:26,055 --> 00:11:28,891
My dad used to talk about those guys.

151
00:11:29,184 --> 00:11:32,269
Now? Fucking drum machine,
some ignorant poetry...

152
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,606
...and any dropout ditsoon
is chairman of the board.

153
00:11:37,316 --> 00:11:38,316
Gangsta.

154
00:11:40,027 --> 00:11:44,030
Talk about paesano pride. Go, Jovi!

155
00:12:06,845 --> 00:12:08,638
- Oh, you're home.
- Hey.

156
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:13,267
- Barb Wagner called, you remember her?
- The mayonnaisers from up the street?

157
00:12:13,477 --> 00:12:15,645
They invited us to a barbecue.

158
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:21,484
All right. Didn't think so.

159
00:12:25,572 --> 00:12:26,823
Still with the brochures?

160
00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:30,785
You believe how much it cost
for a college education?

161
00:12:31,578 --> 00:12:32,954
We got enough.

162
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:36,874
I know we got enough,
but how much is enough?

163
00:12:37,084 --> 00:12:39,293
God forbid, what if
something should happen?

164
00:12:39,586 --> 00:12:43,589
Call up old man Coletti, tell him not
to put too much makeup on my face.

165
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:46,092
Don't joke around about this, Tony.

166
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,094
You'll be taken care of.

167
00:12:48,262 --> 00:12:51,848
You always tell me that,
"I'll be taken care of." By who?

168
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,644
What is with the look?
Did you just make a score?

169
00:12:57,979 --> 00:13:00,146
No. I wish.

170
00:13:00,356 --> 00:13:03,900
You know, Tony, it's a
multiple-choice thing with you.

171
00:13:04,443 --> 00:13:08,697
Because I can't tell if you're
old-fashioned, you're paranoid...

172
00:13:08,906 --> 00:13:10,824
...or just a fucking asshole.

173
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,162
So what do I tell the Wagners?

174
00:13:16,455 --> 00:13:17,789
Do you want to go?

175
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,082
Sure.

176
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:24,170
Even Cusamano asked me to play
a little golf with him at his club.

177
00:13:24,463 --> 00:13:26,590
- Sorry.
- All right, all right.

178
00:13:33,723 --> 00:13:37,392
Prick. New maître d',
he's really on the rag tonight.

179
00:13:38,394 --> 00:13:39,769
I'll talk to him.

180
00:13:40,438 --> 00:13:43,356
- Remember Richie Santini?
- Yeah, you used to fuck him.

181
00:13:43,608 --> 00:13:48,153
That really sums it up. I knew him
since we were 3, he lived next door.

182
00:13:48,404 --> 00:13:51,114
Yeah, we had our little phase.

183
00:13:51,824 --> 00:13:54,284
- What about him?
- You've heard his band?

184
00:13:55,244 --> 00:13:58,121
Defiler? I'm not into
that headbanging shit.

185
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:02,626
You talked about the good old days:
Italians running the music business.

186
00:14:02,877 --> 00:14:06,796
Richie's this musician who you know.
They're not a hair band anymore.

187
00:14:07,006 --> 00:14:08,089
And they're good!

188
00:14:09,091 --> 00:14:12,385
You said yourself how much money
there was in this thing.

189
00:14:12,594 --> 00:14:15,971
You mean, like, Richie Santini?

190
00:14:18,266 --> 00:14:20,392
Would Massive Genius be interested?

191
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:23,604
It's a whole different thing. Black.

192
00:14:23,855 --> 00:14:29,026
But he's got Massive G Productions.
Shit, they make movies even!

193
00:14:31,321 --> 00:14:36,492
Massive does owe me a favor.
I'm arranging a sit-down with Hesh.

194
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:41,705
I was thinking about... Okay, okay,
I know this sounds kind of funny.

195
00:14:42,374 --> 00:14:43,874
Music management.

196
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:47,878
I have met people, important people...

197
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:53,217
...learned people skills, how to deal
with big egos, solve problems.

198
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:56,679
And with my love of
all kinds of music...

199
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,600
Maybe Alec Baldwin would
come to our house.

200
00:15:28,837 --> 00:15:30,838
It's an old demo.

201
00:15:31,005 --> 00:15:32,463
No, you know what?

202
00:15:33,507 --> 00:15:34,757
Fuck it.

203
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:36,884
Let's set you up.

204
00:15:37,094 --> 00:15:39,595
- What?
- I got money.

205
00:15:39,763 --> 00:15:43,099
With how much you listen to
the radio, you'd be good.

206
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:45,727
I can't believe it.

207
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,104
But I get to pick what you wear.

208
00:15:48,772 --> 00:15:51,899
Dress you up. I like that.

209
00:16:07,124 --> 00:16:09,167
This place has the flavor.

210
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:12,086
That gelding, name is Sydney.

211
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,298
You never wrote a song about him?

212
00:16:17,593 --> 00:16:20,678
When you and Little Jimmy were
writing all his hits...

213
00:16:20,888 --> 00:16:24,640
...did you write the music
and him the lyrics or vice versa?

214
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,685
We had our own process.

215
00:16:28,228 --> 00:16:31,856
So that "Ooh, wacka-doo,
wacka-dooly do, I'm so blue..."

216
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:35,151
That spring from your experience
or the little brother's?

217
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,487
One could write a song about a horse.

218
00:16:37,988 --> 00:16:40,239
But to be a hit with your audience...

219
00:16:40,491 --> 00:16:44,202
...you'd have a cop on him, be ripped
up the ass with a Mac 10, no?

220
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:48,164
So you bought horses
with your royalties.

221
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:50,792
What about Little Jimmy's royalties?

222
00:16:51,334 --> 00:16:52,876
He bought horse.

223
00:16:54,003 --> 00:16:58,298
Music business back then, we broke
all the rules as we went along.

224
00:16:58,508 --> 00:17:00,509
You mean raping and pillaging.

225
00:17:00,676 --> 00:17:02,803
Things haven't changed much, huh?

226
00:17:03,012 --> 00:17:07,015
Were we hard-nosed? Yeah.
But we gave a lot of kids their start.

227
00:17:07,183 --> 00:17:10,018
A lot of Negro youth.
Took them out of the ghetto.

228
00:17:10,228 --> 00:17:11,686
Put them on the stage.

229
00:17:11,854 --> 00:17:17,025
Ordinarily I'd be more than happy
to stroll down Memory Lane with you...

230
00:17:17,485 --> 00:17:19,361
...but I want reparations.

231
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:22,364
Why don't we call this what it is?
A shakedown.

232
00:17:22,698 --> 00:17:25,534
Your father was a silent partner
in F-Note Records.

233
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:29,121
Made sure that the records
got airplay, right?

234
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,873
That money bought my house
at the Jersey Shore.

235
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,876
What are you gonna do?
I'm guided by you.

236
00:17:35,044 --> 00:17:37,462
He's gotta do the right thing,
that's what.

237
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,300
You're way out of line, kid. Let's
get some cold water on your head.

238
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,892
Thank you, Jen.
Let's get right to the point, huh?

239
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,310
What's in this for you?

240
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,688
If you read Chuck D's book...

241
00:17:54,897 --> 00:17:57,274
...he advises that
reparations be made...

242
00:17:57,525 --> 00:18:00,402
...by the Jewish studio moguls
in Hollywood.

243
00:18:00,695 --> 00:18:03,405
For the way black folks
were portrayed on film.

244
00:18:04,407 --> 00:18:06,575
It's germane
to this argument in that...

245
00:18:06,784 --> 00:18:10,287
...the grievances in the music
business are far worse.

246
00:18:10,495 --> 00:18:13,414
You're talking to
the wrong white man, my friend.

247
00:18:13,707 --> 00:18:17,918
My people were the white man's nigger
when yours were still chasing zebras.

248
00:18:19,212 --> 00:18:22,381
As far as Louis B. Mayer is concerned,
what are you, nuts?

249
00:18:25,177 --> 00:18:27,052
My lawyers have done research.

250
00:18:28,263 --> 00:18:32,892
I think that the final figure
is somewhere around $400,000.

251
00:18:35,437 --> 00:18:39,773
Now, a cashier's check made
to a Mrs. Idella Willis...

252
00:18:40,066 --> 00:18:41,483
...will set it straight.

253
00:18:41,651 --> 00:18:42,651
Or what?

254
00:18:48,283 --> 00:18:50,201
What was it that she called him?

255
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:52,077
Oh, yeah.

256
00:18:53,413 --> 00:18:56,624
"That nice man," I think she said.

257
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:08,844
So how's your neighbor?
The one with no neck?

258
00:19:09,054 --> 00:19:10,512
The Sopranos?

259
00:19:10,722 --> 00:19:14,683
There's a new car in the driveway
every other week. Besides that...

260
00:19:14,893 --> 00:19:17,895
He gave me a gift of
some excellent Cuban cigars.

261
00:19:18,063 --> 00:19:19,146
And you accepted them.

262
00:19:19,856 --> 00:19:22,483
See? Eroding the neighborhood values.

263
00:19:22,692 --> 00:19:26,862
He was thanking me for the physician,
which he is very happy with.

264
00:19:27,072 --> 00:19:28,072
Really?

265
00:19:29,698 --> 00:19:33,701
What does that do to property values?
Having a gangster living next door?

266
00:19:33,994 --> 00:19:35,161
Are you kidding?

267
00:19:35,454 --> 00:19:38,665
Safest block in the neighb.
Being a gangster, what's that mean?

268
00:19:38,874 --> 00:19:43,253
The shit I see in the boardroom, I
don't know if I'd make a distinction.

269
00:19:43,587 --> 00:19:45,797
Oh, will you, please?
It's not the same.

270
00:19:46,048 --> 00:19:48,508
Bugging, bribes? I don't know.

271
00:19:48,676 --> 00:19:52,679
I think the only thing separating
American business from the Mobs...

272
00:19:53,013 --> 00:19:54,681
...is whacking somebody.

273
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,182
- Listen to you!
- What?

274
00:19:56,433 --> 00:19:58,017
Whacking!

275
00:19:58,602 --> 00:20:03,189
He hangs around with Tony Soprano and
it's "fucking this, fucking that."

276
00:20:05,025 --> 00:20:09,237
We were there for that fundraiser.
I didn't see any guns anywhere.

277
00:20:09,863 --> 00:20:12,824
But that bar with
the goombah Murano glass.

278
00:20:15,703 --> 00:20:17,662
I like Murano glass.

279
00:20:22,251 --> 00:20:23,876
Those Montecristos.

280
00:20:24,336 --> 00:20:26,671
What do you say? After dinner?

281
00:21:04,876 --> 00:21:07,085
It ain't your type
of music, but...

282
00:21:07,295 --> 00:21:10,213
I like any kind of music
that turns shit green.

283
00:21:11,883 --> 00:21:14,509
He's been through a lot.
It's deepened his writing.

284
00:21:14,802 --> 00:21:17,220
As a metal band
they were great, but this...

285
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:20,474
...as far as I am concerned,
blows away Matchbox 20.

286
00:21:20,683 --> 00:21:22,100
What do they call themselves?

287
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:26,605
Used to be Defiler. Then some
personnel changes, bass and drums.

288
00:21:26,814 --> 00:21:29,608
But Richie and Vito are still
the core of the band.

289
00:21:29,817 --> 00:21:31,777
Now they're called Visiting Day.

290
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,709
This is some loud shit!

291
00:22:04,185 --> 00:22:05,268
That's Richie.

292
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,189
And that's Vito.

293
00:22:16,113 --> 00:22:17,279
Fuck you!

294
00:22:17,489 --> 00:22:19,657
Sit the fuck down, you mullethead!

295
00:22:25,664 --> 00:22:27,957
This isn't the right place for them.

296
00:22:31,002 --> 00:22:33,587
- Boo!
- You suck!

297
00:22:33,797 --> 00:22:35,840
Without the right help from you...

298
00:22:36,091 --> 00:22:39,802
...Visiting Day could end up
in the miscellaneous V section.

299
00:22:49,855 --> 00:22:51,272
You interested?

300
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,608
Yes.

301
00:23:00,532 --> 00:23:03,284
That scene where Pesci sticks
the guy's head in a vise...

302
00:23:03,535 --> 00:23:06,829
...and then pops his eye out.
I thought I was gonna die!

303
00:23:11,918 --> 00:23:13,919
I'll be right back, okay?

304
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,089
Excuse me.

305
00:23:17,382 --> 00:23:18,716
- It's this way?
- Yes.

306
00:23:19,009 --> 00:23:20,217
Thank you.

307
00:24:00,925 --> 00:24:03,134
- I don't know.
- What?

308
00:24:03,511 --> 00:24:07,722
Richie, the guy's 30,
still lives with his parents.

309
00:24:07,932 --> 00:24:09,516
It's because of the accident.

310
00:24:09,767 --> 00:24:11,935
Richie had third-degree burns
from trying...

311
00:24:12,144 --> 00:24:14,812
...to grill that trout
with a downed power line.

312
00:24:15,231 --> 00:24:18,942
But at the same time, being
electrocuted turned his life around.

313
00:24:20,486 --> 00:24:22,737
Well, you did
some ace fucking selling.

314
00:24:22,947 --> 00:24:24,113
You think?

315
00:24:24,949 --> 00:24:26,491
Yeah, thing is though...

316
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,620
...music is not something
you can hold in your hands, you know?

317
00:24:30,829 --> 00:24:35,625
Like football betting cards or coke.

318
00:24:35,918 --> 00:24:37,502
It's art.

319
00:24:37,962 --> 00:24:41,673
Berry Gordy, whatever,
he had to see it in the Supremes.

320
00:24:41,924 --> 00:24:45,635
It's an instinct.
I see it in Richie.

321
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:48,554
Yeah, probably is.

322
00:24:49,764 --> 00:24:51,932
I'm really fucking doing it!

323
00:24:52,141 --> 00:24:54,393
And it's all thanks to you.

324
00:24:55,979 --> 00:25:00,274
I'm gonna make a demo CD like
Massive advised. And then, yeah!

325
00:25:00,817 --> 00:25:02,818
My wife thinks I need
to meet new people.

326
00:25:02,986 --> 00:25:05,654
- So?
- You're Italian, you understand.

327
00:25:06,155 --> 00:25:09,491
We're brought up to think
the americani are fucking bores.

328
00:25:10,201 --> 00:25:12,661
But the average white man's
no more boring...

329
00:25:12,829 --> 00:25:17,040
...than the millionth conversation over
who should have won, Marciano or Ali.

330
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:20,502
Am I to understand that
you don't consider yourself white?

331
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:24,339
I don't mean white like Caucasian.
I mean a white man.

332
00:25:24,507 --> 00:25:26,633
Like our friend Cusamano.

333
00:25:27,343 --> 00:25:29,720
Now, he's Italian,
but he's americano.

334
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:34,349
What Dad called a "Wonder Bread Wop."
He eats his Sunday gravy out of a jar.

335
00:25:34,517 --> 00:25:38,729
You seem to want to branch out.
What's stopping you?

336
00:25:38,938 --> 00:25:40,689
The guys, you know.

337
00:25:42,317 --> 00:25:45,736
What they'd think if I started
hanging out with the americani.

338
00:25:56,205 --> 00:25:59,916
I was in the neighborhood last night.
At the Cusamanos'.

339
00:26:03,503 --> 00:26:04,503
Oh, yeah?

340
00:26:05,213 --> 00:26:06,797
Dinner party.

341
00:26:08,925 --> 00:26:13,054
You should have stopped by.
Live right next door.

342
00:26:20,729 --> 00:26:25,149
You didn't hear any strange noises
last night in your neighborhood?

343
00:26:26,068 --> 00:26:27,401
Noises?

344
00:26:27,903 --> 00:26:30,529
Like someone screaming in pain?

345
00:26:31,948 --> 00:26:33,240
No.

346
00:26:34,951 --> 00:26:37,411
Probably a television set.

347
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:43,668
You saw my house?

348
00:26:55,514 --> 00:26:57,640
Oh, this looks good.

349
00:27:00,227 --> 00:27:03,479
That sausage, where'd you get it?
That place in Garfield?

350
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:07,441
- Honey? Where'd we get the sausage?
- That place in Garfield.

351
00:27:07,651 --> 00:27:11,028
The only thing better than salsiccia
is a pair of tits.

352
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,531
It's a hell of a piece of meat.

353
00:27:13,782 --> 00:27:16,742
Salsiccia is a kind of a phallic thing.

354
00:27:16,993 --> 00:27:18,494
Whereas tits...

355
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,125
Jack, you're a stockbroker, right?

356
00:27:25,668 --> 00:27:28,128
Any changes in the market coming?

357
00:27:28,629 --> 00:27:31,131
- It's always changing.
- Keeps us coming back.

358
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:36,636
Rand, you hear from Ross on Dexplex?

359
00:27:36,804 --> 00:27:38,930
No, but the buyout is going down.

360
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,891
Give me some warning.
I need to call the islands.

361
00:27:42,143 --> 00:27:43,268
Dexplex?

362
00:27:51,277 --> 00:27:53,987
It's a little company.
It's going public, maybe.

363
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,240
Come on. The sun is shining,
it's a beautiful day.

364
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,701
Let's not talk business for once.

365
00:28:00,077 --> 00:28:01,161
American Biotics.

366
00:28:01,328 --> 00:28:04,289
Barb, our stock guru.

367
00:28:04,498 --> 00:28:07,333
She thinks American Biotics
may be a good investment.

368
00:28:07,626 --> 00:28:11,171
They're close to a side-effect-free
anti-impotence drug.

369
00:28:11,338 --> 00:28:12,964
You guys play the stock market?

370
00:28:13,174 --> 00:28:15,341
Oh, we don't just play...

371
00:28:15,551 --> 00:28:16,843
...we win.

372
00:30:16,336 --> 00:30:18,421
That's take 62.

373
00:30:18,755 --> 00:30:20,298
We ought to just bag it.

374
00:30:28,765 --> 00:30:30,850
Okay, we're bagging it.

375
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:34,061
We should've bagged this
days ago when it was perfect.

376
00:30:34,646 --> 00:30:36,647
I wish I had thought of that.

377
00:30:39,985 --> 00:30:42,862
It's good. You know, not bad.

378
00:30:43,447 --> 00:30:44,947
It's as good as we'll get.

379
00:30:45,157 --> 00:30:48,159
Oh, it wasn't too bad.
It was kind of good!

380
00:30:51,121 --> 00:30:53,748
What are you saying?
Is something wrong?

381
00:30:53,957 --> 00:30:57,960
We're all trying our best here.
I just think we hit a brick wall.

382
00:30:58,128 --> 00:30:59,837
Maybe some rest.

383
00:31:01,423 --> 00:31:03,257
Hey, hey, fuck that!

384
00:31:03,467 --> 00:31:05,468
I paid for three days' studio time.

385
00:31:05,677 --> 00:31:09,180
It'll only cost me more
to pack it up and come back again.

386
00:31:09,431 --> 00:31:12,683
We got through the instrumental
tracks with no problem.

387
00:31:12,851 --> 00:31:14,644
I'm fucking beat.

388
00:31:14,853 --> 00:31:16,687
What about we finish this shit?

389
00:31:16,938 --> 00:31:19,147
Three days we've been slamming our
hams!

390
00:31:19,315 --> 00:31:22,317
Kinko's gave me five days off.
No big deal.

391
00:31:22,526 --> 00:31:26,404
Kinko's? Buddy, this is
costing me 300 bucks an hour!

392
00:31:26,614 --> 00:31:27,864
Here, try this.

393
00:31:31,077 --> 00:31:34,204
Dude, I don't do drugs anymore, okay?

394
00:31:34,538 --> 00:31:38,208
Well, hats off. But for all
the excitement in these songs...

395
00:31:38,417 --> 00:31:41,252
...maybe you should suck on
another downed power line.

396
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,545
Christopher!

397
00:31:42,755 --> 00:31:47,092
That was our most introspective song.
It's not supposed to rock.

398
00:31:47,301 --> 00:31:49,719
- It'll be our first single.
- No, second.

399
00:31:50,346 --> 00:31:53,056
- "Sharon's Chair" will bust out.
- I like "Melt."

400
00:31:53,891 --> 00:31:56,726
Come on. Go shoot the crank.
Let's wrap this up.

401
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:01,064
- What?
- You heard me. Spike up!

402
00:32:01,357 --> 00:32:02,357
No fucking way.

403
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,901
I'm producing these sessions.

404
00:32:05,111 --> 00:32:08,530
Go take the fucking drugs!
I'm not fucking around anymore!

405
00:32:08,739 --> 00:32:10,532
Look, the problem, Christopher...

406
00:32:10,741 --> 00:32:14,911
...is the bass and the drum tracks
were miked wrong from the beginning!

407
00:32:15,246 --> 00:32:18,707
Hey, King of Rock,
you're out of your depth.

408
00:32:18,916 --> 00:32:20,583
Let me tell you something.

409
00:32:20,835 --> 00:32:24,170
Thank you,
but I've recorded in Denmark.

410
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,298
You want to know what the problem is?

411
00:32:27,591 --> 00:32:30,760
Where are the fucking choruses?

412
00:32:31,053 --> 00:32:33,930
All your songs, you got no choruses.

413
00:32:34,265 --> 00:32:38,101
Your choruses are just another verse.
What happened to "She loves You"?

414
00:32:38,601 --> 00:32:39,643
"She Loves You"?

415
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:42,062
Yeah, the song started
with the chorus.

416
00:32:42,272 --> 00:32:45,524
There is structure.
That's how you build a song.

417
00:32:45,775 --> 00:32:50,904
The Beatles. That's been 40 years now
and it makes me fucking sick!

418
00:32:51,114 --> 00:32:52,740
What is he, nuts?

419
00:32:52,949 --> 00:32:55,075
- Fuck this, man.
- Where you going?

420
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:58,912
I'm going to AA, you fucking jerk-off!

421
00:32:59,831 --> 00:33:01,457
- Get back to work.
- Christopher!

422
00:33:01,666 --> 00:33:03,667
- Okay.
- Come on, come on!

423
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,836
Big man, huh?

424
00:33:12,302 --> 00:33:14,636
- Fuck!
- You all right?

425
00:33:17,307 --> 00:33:21,060
What? What...
Get back in the booth!

426
00:33:24,064 --> 00:33:26,273
So we take it from the top.

427
00:33:26,983 --> 00:33:28,984
We'll use a ukulele.

428
00:33:29,235 --> 00:33:30,861
I can't believe you!

429
00:33:31,154 --> 00:33:33,155
5,000 shares.

430
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:36,075
Yes, American Biotics.

431
00:33:36,951 --> 00:33:39,119
Yeah, can you place the order today?

432
00:33:40,705 --> 00:33:43,791
Okay, great. I'll have the money
to you by tomorrow.

433
00:33:44,793 --> 00:33:48,754
Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye.

434
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:56,261
- What, are you spying on people now?
- I live here.

435
00:33:56,929 --> 00:33:58,554
You playing Wall Street now?

436
00:33:59,848 --> 00:34:03,101
Women are better savers than men.
And we are nurturers.

437
00:34:04,144 --> 00:34:06,187
What do you know about
the stock market?

438
00:34:06,355 --> 00:34:10,691
I keep my ears open.
CNBC is a very interesting channel.

439
00:34:13,654 --> 00:34:16,114
Your father, God bless him,
does very well.

440
00:34:16,365 --> 00:34:20,493
But who knows? What if something
unforeseen should happen?

441
00:34:20,702 --> 00:34:23,621
What if he gets hit by a truck?
I mean, then what?

442
00:34:23,831 --> 00:34:26,040
- I got you kids to think about.
- I don't know.

443
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,834
When you get married, you will.

444
00:34:28,544 --> 00:34:33,131
A woman has to keep her individuality.
This here is a life lesson.

445
00:34:38,345 --> 00:34:39,637
Okay.

446
00:34:40,097 --> 00:34:43,641
Let's go to Georgette Klinger's.
Massage, facial...

447
00:34:43,851 --> 00:34:46,727
...jour de beauté. On me.

448
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,188
Sure.

449
00:34:54,903 --> 00:34:56,195
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

450
00:34:56,446 --> 00:34:58,489
- It's a lily.
- Now, that's a shot.

451
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,701
- "Ball runs like a frightened faun."
- W.C. Fields.

452
00:35:01,952 --> 00:35:04,829
- That thing's still running!
- This is a nice place.

453
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,957
Didn't I tell you?
We ought to make you a member.

454
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,751
Tony, you ever play
that place in Orlando?

455
00:35:11,086 --> 00:35:15,089
No, I never get down there.
Well, Disneyworld.

456
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,299
You know, Al's place.

457
00:35:18,092 --> 00:35:19,551
Mount Plymouth?

458
00:35:19,927 --> 00:35:21,761
- AI Capone built it.
- No shit?

459
00:35:22,263 --> 00:35:27,100
- He was a golf fanatic, that's right.
- So you guys watch A&E.

460
00:35:28,352 --> 00:35:33,106
Tony, let me ask you a question.
If I'm stepping on toes, tell me.

461
00:35:33,316 --> 00:35:34,900
How real was The Godfather?

462
00:35:40,072 --> 00:35:41,907
I mean, in your opinion.

463
00:35:42,116 --> 00:35:45,327
- What do you mean, real?
- Authentic or not.

464
00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:47,370
I don't know.

465
00:35:48,623 --> 00:35:51,791
How would I know?
It was the '50s, right?

466
00:35:52,376 --> 00:35:56,504
- No, it wasn't. It was 1972.
- No, the story took place in the '50s.

467
00:35:56,756 --> 00:35:59,633
Did you really have to cut
your finger and take an oath?

468
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:10,393
Like gridlock on Times Square
today, isn't it?

469
00:36:10,645 --> 00:36:13,480
Traffic in Manhattan's worsened
since "Don't block the box."

470
00:36:13,731 --> 00:36:16,358
You got a lot of friends
in New York, Tony?

471
00:36:16,567 --> 00:36:18,735
- Yeah.
- You ever go to Little Italy?

472
00:36:19,779 --> 00:36:22,239
San Gennaro, the feast with the kids.

473
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:25,533
What do you think of
when you hear Mulberry Street?

474
00:36:25,701 --> 00:36:27,869
- Umberto's.
- Hey! All right!

475
00:36:29,497 --> 00:36:33,541
You ever see that picture of Galante
dead, with a cigar in his mouth?

476
00:36:34,709 --> 00:36:37,962
- No.
- It was a fucking beautiful hit.

477
00:36:40,757 --> 00:36:44,343
Sorry, Tony.
You probably knew the guy, huh?

478
00:36:45,053 --> 00:36:46,762
How fucking old you think I am?

479
00:36:47,514 --> 00:36:51,475
You don't have to answer this if you
don't want to, but I gotta know.

480
00:36:51,726 --> 00:36:54,478
Did you ever meet John Gotti?

481
00:36:59,943 --> 00:37:02,194
Yeah. I knew John.

482
00:37:02,362 --> 00:37:03,779
Fuck!

483
00:37:05,073 --> 00:37:06,907
What was he really like?

484
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:14,707
- Remember Bungalow Bar?
- The ice cream trucks?

485
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:18,544
Like Good Humor, except
the trucks had bungalow roofs on.

486
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:22,381
Was Gotti a silent partner in that?

487
00:37:22,549 --> 00:37:24,925
I don't know nothing about that.

488
00:37:25,135 --> 00:37:27,553
Just know that
when the company folded...

489
00:37:27,721 --> 00:37:30,723
...and they were auctioning off
the last truck...

490
00:37:31,266 --> 00:37:34,184
...the one with the peaked roofs,
you're right, Cuse.

491
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:40,316
When they were auctioning off
the last truck...

492
00:37:40,567 --> 00:37:42,860
...and I wanted it as a souvenir...

493
00:37:44,946 --> 00:37:46,280
...Gotti outbid me.

494
00:37:50,451 --> 00:37:51,993
Gave me a ride home.

495
00:37:55,748 --> 00:37:59,917
You know, he rang that bell
the whole way home?

496
00:38:12,139 --> 00:38:13,681
They're waving at us.

497
00:38:20,773 --> 00:38:21,773
Meow.

498
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:29,739
Meow.

499
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:31,616
Oh, I love this part.

500
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:40,750
This is good.

501
00:38:50,302 --> 00:38:52,470
Some good guitar. Listen to that.

502
00:38:54,681 --> 00:38:56,391
They got it going on.

503
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:58,059
Yeah.

504
00:39:30,174 --> 00:39:31,299
So?

505
00:39:31,968 --> 00:39:33,760
Well, I think it's not good.

506
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,305
Want to be more specific?

507
00:39:37,515 --> 00:39:39,724
There's good and not good.
This is not good.

508
00:39:39,976 --> 00:39:42,185
Maybe it's not your era, no offense.

509
00:39:42,395 --> 00:39:45,772
Music is music. Talent is talent.
I don't care who you are.

510
00:39:46,023 --> 00:39:50,527
I've seen them all. I saw heavy metal
invented by Hendrix at the Cafe Wah.

511
00:39:50,736 --> 00:39:53,280
Kid just came out of the Army.
I said to him...

512
00:39:53,531 --> 00:39:56,992
..."I don't know if it's talent,
charisma, magic, but you got it."

513
00:39:57,285 --> 00:40:00,370
These kids? They don't, sorry.

514
00:40:00,663 --> 00:40:02,747
You're just pissed about the sit-down.

515
00:40:03,166 --> 00:40:06,126
Get the fuck out of here
and stop wasting my time.

516
00:40:06,377 --> 00:40:09,588
This Vito is a great fucking
guitar player, Hesh.

517
00:40:09,797 --> 00:40:11,339
He's a great guitar player.

518
00:40:11,549 --> 00:40:13,550
However, there's one constant
in music.

519
00:40:13,718 --> 00:40:16,720
A hit is a hit and this is not a hit!

520
00:40:16,929 --> 00:40:18,180
- Why?
- Christ!

521
00:40:18,389 --> 00:40:22,100
For reasons we couldn't comprehend
or codify, you pathetic schlepper!

522
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:26,563
Fucking Massive is a genius,
so what the fuck was he talking about?

523
00:40:26,731 --> 00:40:29,149
When I was a kid, there was this guy.

524
00:40:29,357 --> 00:40:30,858
We called him Jimmy Smash.

525
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,235
Now, he wasn't retarded.

526
00:40:33,487 --> 00:40:38,449
But we thought he was because he had
one of these whatchamacallits:

527
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,869
"Hey, Jimmy, how the fuck are you?"

528
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:44,747
- What do you call that?
- Cleft palate.

529
00:40:44,998 --> 00:40:45,998
Yeah.

530
00:40:47,751 --> 00:40:52,880
Well, we was kids, right?
So what the hell did we know?

531
00:40:53,215 --> 00:40:56,717
Every time he opened his mouth,
we'd piss ourselves laughing.

532
00:40:57,677 --> 00:41:02,473
But Jimmy didn't mind because he got
to hang out with us, the popular crew.

533
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:04,725
We called him when bored.

534
00:41:05,769 --> 00:41:08,979
Call him and say,
"Hey, Jimmy, sing 'Mack the Knife."'

535
00:41:09,189 --> 00:41:12,691
Because he wanted to hang out
with us, he'd belt it right out.

536
00:41:14,653 --> 00:41:17,154
We'd fucking roll
on the floor, laughing.

537
00:41:20,575 --> 00:41:25,663
And then, you know, when the laughs
got old, we stopped calling him.

538
00:41:27,791 --> 00:41:29,208
Wasn't until years later...

539
00:41:29,417 --> 00:41:32,294
...I found out the poor prick
went home every night...

540
00:41:32,546 --> 00:41:34,505
...and cried himself to sleep.

541
00:41:39,636 --> 00:41:41,845
Then when I found out, you know...

542
00:41:42,389 --> 00:41:43,973
...I felt bad.

543
00:41:47,184 --> 00:41:50,853
But I never really understood
what he felt.

544
00:41:51,522 --> 00:41:53,356
To be used, you know...

545
00:41:53,566 --> 00:41:57,485
...for somebody else's amusement
like a fucking dancing bear.

546
00:41:58,153 --> 00:42:00,697
Till I played golf with those guys.

547
00:42:03,534 --> 00:42:05,994
You thought Cusamano was your friend.

548
00:42:07,705 --> 00:42:09,539
You live, you learn.

549
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,546
Can I ask you a question?

550
00:42:18,382 --> 00:42:20,675
Whatever happened to Jimmy?

551
00:42:20,884 --> 00:42:24,804
Jimmy Smash?
He's doing 20 for robbery.

552
00:42:25,806 --> 00:42:27,307
The cops knew who it was.

553
00:42:27,558 --> 00:42:31,394
He goes to the bank in a mask
and goes, "Give me all your money!"

554
00:42:41,572 --> 00:42:43,906
Some fucker's on the phone for you.

555
00:42:48,871 --> 00:42:52,373
- Good morning, Herman. I'm listening.
- Good.

556
00:42:52,666 --> 00:42:55,710
Don't miss what I have to say.
I've been thinking about it.

557
00:42:56,003 --> 00:42:59,756
- Go on.
- Find another schmuck to screw with.

558
00:42:59,965 --> 00:43:01,549
You do know what this means?

559
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,719
Stupid enough to say it over
the phone. Let's hear it.

560
00:43:04,887 --> 00:43:07,221
I don't threaten, Herman. I act.

561
00:43:07,388 --> 00:43:12,351
Genius, you're in way over your head.
Why don't you back up a bit?

562
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,936
You know, let sleeping dogs lie.

563
00:43:15,146 --> 00:43:16,897
Hey, Soprano.

564
00:43:17,106 --> 00:43:19,524
This is what I think about
this gangsta rap shit:

565
00:43:19,734 --> 00:43:22,944
You probably got a degree in
sociology from a city college.

566
00:43:23,154 --> 00:43:26,323
I grew up in the projects. Delta 13.

567
00:43:26,949 --> 00:43:28,408
Killed a man.

568
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:32,788
Later on I got a degree,
but urban planning.

569
00:43:33,706 --> 00:43:34,748
You were close.

570
00:43:34,957 --> 00:43:37,209
Now, when it comes to
"Which is mightier...

571
00:43:37,418 --> 00:43:40,504
...the pen or
the motherfucking sword?"...

572
00:43:40,713 --> 00:43:42,339
...I let the situation dictate.

573
00:43:42,548 --> 00:43:43,715
Don't press it.

574
00:43:43,925 --> 00:43:48,303
I'm gonna do my part to keep
Mr. Rabkin's people working.

575
00:43:48,471 --> 00:43:49,596
What's that mean?

576
00:43:49,806 --> 00:43:52,974
Expect to hear from
Goldstein, Baum and Woronov.

577
00:43:53,267 --> 00:43:55,477
They represent us in the lawsuit.

578
00:43:55,937 --> 00:43:57,104
You gonna sue?

579
00:43:57,271 --> 00:43:59,731
With what I pay in retainers?
Fuck, yeah!

580
00:43:59,941 --> 00:44:00,941
I hear that.

581
00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:03,652
- Yeah, well...
- Listen, tatteleh.

582
00:44:03,903 --> 00:44:08,448
Be advised that on your last single,
you sampled the backing vocal...

583
00:44:08,658 --> 00:44:12,285
...from the Chablis' 1968 song,
"Riff Wit It."

584
00:44:12,453 --> 00:44:15,622
For which F-Note Records controls
the recording rights.

585
00:44:15,873 --> 00:44:18,083
- No shit.
- Yes, shit.

586
00:44:18,292 --> 00:44:20,961
I would, of course,
have to countersue.

587
00:44:21,504 --> 00:44:23,380
I'll see you in court.

588
00:44:24,506 --> 00:44:26,632
Fucking legal fees.

589
00:44:27,884 --> 00:44:31,721
What kind of melanzane are these?
They call themselves gangsters.

590
00:44:31,972 --> 00:44:34,140
It's a new fucking day.

591
00:44:34,725 --> 00:44:36,726
Fucking depressing.

592
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:39,937
Now, this is a Donatella Versace.

593
00:44:40,313 --> 00:44:41,313
Nice.

594
00:44:41,481 --> 00:44:43,816
You like it better than the Alaia?

595
00:44:49,614 --> 00:44:52,950
- Keep them both.
- Christopher, $2400!

596
00:44:54,745 --> 00:44:58,873
- I don't think you really like it.
- I like it. I like it.

597
00:45:08,049 --> 00:45:10,134
MTV Awards?

598
00:45:14,389 --> 00:45:15,473
What?

599
00:45:16,683 --> 00:45:18,058
Nothing.

600
00:45:18,977 --> 00:45:20,895
I thought that fight was over.

601
00:45:21,146 --> 00:45:23,564
You want me to take it back?
No problem.

602
00:45:23,857 --> 00:45:26,150
No! Fuck, I want you to have it.

603
00:45:42,542 --> 00:45:45,461
You know how I use
positive visualization?

604
00:45:45,711 --> 00:45:49,923
I know you talk about it. You're
fairly negative a lot of the time.

605
00:45:50,549 --> 00:45:52,258
You should mentally prepare...

606
00:45:52,551 --> 00:45:55,970
...for the fucking possibility
that Visiting Day sucks.

607
00:45:58,724 --> 00:45:59,724
What?

608
00:45:59,975 --> 00:46:04,604
You've gotten this far with Massive
because he wants to be in your pants.

609
00:46:06,398 --> 00:46:08,066
Boy, oh, boy.

610
00:46:09,109 --> 00:46:13,154
I let some experts listen to
the demo. They shit all over it.

611
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:17,534
Experts? Who? Hesh?
That old fucking synagogue cantor?

612
00:46:17,743 --> 00:46:19,953
Silvio, he owned rock clubs in Asbury.

613
00:46:20,204 --> 00:46:23,206
You heard what Squid said.
He's a professional engineer.

614
00:46:23,499 --> 00:46:28,086
What about my opinion?
That it's good, that it's special?!

615
00:46:34,677 --> 00:46:39,097
His eyes are on your ass 98%
of the time. You know that.

616
00:46:40,516 --> 00:46:42,684
You're just trying to keep me down!

617
00:46:42,977 --> 00:46:44,227
That ain't fair!

618
00:46:44,478 --> 00:46:45,812
I don't want these clothes.

619
00:46:51,694 --> 00:46:54,654
What's wrong with it?
What's wrong with Visiting Day?

620
00:46:54,905 --> 00:46:56,072
I don't know.

621
00:46:56,782 --> 00:47:00,451
It's a problem that you don't know.
Richie, he'll sing anything.

622
00:47:00,661 --> 00:47:05,623
You just don't believe my relationship
with Massive isn't based on fucking!

623
00:47:06,666 --> 00:47:08,500
It's based on intelligence.

624
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:10,502
Respect. Talent!

625
00:47:10,712 --> 00:47:12,129
I'll shut up.

626
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:18,802
You saying I don't have talent?

627
00:47:22,557 --> 00:47:27,185
I branched out, made new friends,
new horizons and you can't stand that!

628
00:47:30,106 --> 00:47:33,317
Yeah, go silent. That's you:

629
00:47:33,526 --> 00:47:35,986
Either screaming your head off
or fucking dead.

630
00:47:38,698 --> 00:47:40,824
I don't think I can stay here anymore.

631
00:47:47,498 --> 00:47:50,918
- I love you.
- That is such a lie!

632
00:47:59,636 --> 00:48:02,512
- Hey, Carmela!
- In here!

633
00:48:09,145 --> 00:48:10,479
I need a finger.

634
00:48:12,607 --> 00:48:15,108
- What's in the box?
- Sand.

635
00:48:15,485 --> 00:48:16,902
I'm fucking with Cusamano.

636
00:48:17,362 --> 00:48:18,403
Tony!

637
00:48:19,072 --> 00:48:20,405
Beautiful!

638
00:48:20,781 --> 00:48:22,782
You're cute when you're a bad boy.

639
00:48:22,991 --> 00:48:25,117
You're awfully chipper today.

640
00:48:25,327 --> 00:48:28,537
- So what are you doing with the box?
- Give it to him.

641
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:33,584
- Tell him to hold onto it for a while.
- Oh, Tony, that is so evil!

642
00:48:33,835 --> 00:48:36,295
Yeah, I know.
That's why it's so much fun.

643
00:48:37,339 --> 00:48:39,173
Oh, God.

644
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:01,904
Cuse! Cuse! Cuse!

645
00:49:02,155 --> 00:49:03,531
Come here.

646
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:08,327
- Hey, Ton. How you doing?
- Good, how you doing?

647
00:49:08,578 --> 00:49:11,622
Fine, thanks. Listen...

648
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:14,250
...you know, that nickname...

649
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:16,210
What? Cuse? Cusamano!

650
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:19,880
- It's got that other connotation...
- No, no, not anymore.

651
00:49:20,132 --> 00:49:24,260
I need a little solid. I need you
to hang onto this for a while for me.

652
00:49:26,304 --> 00:49:29,140
Hang onto it and I'll come get it
when I need it.

653
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:30,933
How long?

654
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:34,353
A month. Maybe more, maybe less.

655
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:37,273
- Okay? Thanks.
- Yeah, sure.

656
00:49:38,358 --> 00:49:41,444
I meant to ask you about the club.
What's going on?

657
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:43,319
Oh, the club.

658
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:48,324
I'm sorry, Ton.
Membership's closed.

659
00:49:49,243 --> 00:49:51,369
- Closed?
- Yeah.

660
00:49:52,288 --> 00:49:56,291
- No new members until old members die.
- Nobody's dying?

661
00:49:57,793 --> 00:50:00,462
- Nothing we could do anything about.
- No biggie, Cuse.

662
00:50:00,713 --> 00:50:02,005
- You sure?
- Thanks.

663
00:50:02,173 --> 00:50:05,550
- I mean, because...
- No. I'll live.

664
00:51:10,198 --> 00:51:13,158
Now, that's a hit.

665
00:51:25,547 --> 00:51:26,922
What is it? Heroin?

666
00:51:27,215 --> 00:51:31,301
Shit, Jean, I don't know.
A weapon? I don't know.

667
00:51:33,054 --> 00:51:34,388
Could be anything.

668
00:51:37,725 --> 00:51:39,184
Don't touch it.


1
00:01:45,257 --> 00:01:47,675
Debbie, you got magic fingers.

2
00:01:47,968 --> 00:01:50,636
I bet you give a great hand job.

3
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:51,971
Yeah, she does.

4
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,764
Hey, here's my baby.

5
00:01:54,015 --> 00:01:57,226
Debbie, you gotta put her
on the A list. Really.

6
00:01:57,477 --> 00:01:59,645
She rides better
than Willie Shoemaker.

7
00:01:59,896 --> 00:02:02,022
- Did she go to the whip?
- He's so crazy.

8
00:02:02,232 --> 00:02:03,983
Only in the homestretch.

9
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:08,612
Another satisfied customer.

10
00:02:09,197 --> 00:02:11,448
I think he's having a heart attack!

11
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,204
Don't move.

12
00:02:17,456 --> 00:02:20,166
Go see if Dr. Mop-N-Glo is still here.

13
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,086
- Dr. Mop-N-Glo?
- Who?

14
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:25,380
Don't worry, he's a real doctor.

15
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:26,631
Dermatologist.

16
00:02:26,882 --> 00:02:28,258
What's the matter?

17
00:02:28,467 --> 00:02:30,885
Dr. Edelstein,
looks like a heart attack.

18
00:02:31,178 --> 00:02:33,054
I don't need no doctor.

19
00:02:33,264 --> 00:02:35,432
It's just my back.

20
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:37,225
Nice and slow.

21
00:02:39,895 --> 00:02:42,439
Grab the rail, grab the rail.
That's right.

22
00:02:43,524 --> 00:02:46,109
Go easy, go easy now. That's it.

23
00:02:46,402 --> 00:02:47,694
Nice and easy.

24
00:02:47,987 --> 00:02:49,446
Nice and easy.

25
00:02:49,697 --> 00:02:51,448
That's it, that's it.

26
00:02:51,657 --> 00:02:53,825
Come on, that's it.

27
00:02:55,077 --> 00:02:56,077
Hold the rail.

28
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,792
Go slow, go slow.

29
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:11,801
Eighty to you.

30
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:17,265
Fuck this.

31
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:19,267
Your back still bothering you?

32
00:03:20,687 --> 00:03:21,979
Yeah?

33
00:03:23,273 --> 00:03:25,232
FBI! Nobody move!

34
00:03:25,442 --> 00:03:27,109
You believe this shit?

35
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:32,073
- Come on, it's a friendly card game.
- Relax, Jimmy.

36
00:03:32,282 --> 00:03:35,993
If I wanted to bust up card games,
I'd have a doughnut in my mouth.

37
00:03:52,094 --> 00:03:54,095
Derek, give him a hand.

38
00:04:03,105 --> 00:04:04,647
Hey! Hey!

39
00:04:04,856 --> 00:04:06,565
- Get him!
- You! You!

40
00:04:12,155 --> 00:04:14,573
Oh, my goodness.
Do you know what this is?

41
00:04:14,783 --> 00:04:16,200
It's a fucking gun!

42
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:30,715
Fucking Jimmy's still in jail.

43
00:04:31,008 --> 00:04:32,050
Don't mean shit.

44
00:04:32,218 --> 00:04:34,845
I don't like it.
This is how it starts.

45
00:04:35,012 --> 00:04:36,638
I think it was a potluck raid.

46
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:38,807
Make it look like
they're earning their pay.

47
00:04:38,975 --> 00:04:39,975
I agree.

48
00:04:40,184 --> 00:04:41,977
But why would Pussy run?

49
00:04:42,186 --> 00:04:45,188
He's out of breath lifting his dick
to take a leak.

50
00:04:47,358 --> 00:04:49,276
Oh, Puss!

51
00:04:49,527 --> 00:04:51,153
Your ears must be ringing.

52
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,571
Come on, run!

53
00:04:53,573 --> 00:04:56,783
Ha, ha. You guys are a fucking riot.

54
00:04:58,077 --> 00:05:00,704
We were gonna draw straws
to see who'd bail you out.

55
00:05:00,913 --> 00:05:03,540
My wife did. I nearly
strangled her on the ride home.

56
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,377
My head's hurting, I got agita,
and on top of that...

57
00:05:07,545 --> 00:05:09,421
...I threw my back out again.

58
00:05:09,714 --> 00:05:12,048
Maybe it was that 10-yard dash.

59
00:05:12,758 --> 00:05:14,509
We don't run. It's embarrassing.

60
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,179
- Those Federal pricks robbed me.
- What?

61
00:05:17,472 --> 00:05:20,015
They grabbed four dimes from me.

62
00:05:20,224 --> 00:05:22,434
You shouldn't carry that type of cash!

63
00:05:22,978 --> 00:05:25,188
Never mind, I need a drink.

64
00:05:27,065 --> 00:05:29,233
Oh, Madonna! Che puzzo!

65
00:05:29,401 --> 00:05:31,819
Oh, Jesus!

66
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,168
This better be good.
I was fishing.

67
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:50,421
What, no "How you been?
How's it doing, Vin?"

68
00:05:50,631 --> 00:05:52,673
I thought we understood each other.

69
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:56,636
I don't care about you, your family
or whether you take it up the ass.

70
00:05:56,887 --> 00:05:59,722
What's so important
you take me away from my boat?

71
00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:01,974
Fuckface, where you going?

72
00:06:02,226 --> 00:06:05,228
Why do you talk to me like this?
I do risky shit for you.

73
00:06:05,437 --> 00:06:08,105
You're not doing
charity work, remember?

74
00:06:10,859 --> 00:06:12,610
All right, I'm sorry.

75
00:06:12,945 --> 00:06:16,822
Hey, Vin, how you doing?
What do you got for me?

76
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,536
Bompensiero.

77
00:06:21,703 --> 00:06:22,703
Pussy?

78
00:06:23,414 --> 00:06:24,456
What about him?

79
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,000
He's wired for sound.

80
00:06:27,293 --> 00:06:28,293
What?

81
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:32,798
I got it from a good source.
I thought you should know. All right?

82
00:06:33,007 --> 00:06:35,717
- I'm sorry. I know you like him.
- Like him?

83
00:06:36,427 --> 00:06:38,303
I fucking love him.

84
00:06:38,596 --> 00:06:40,305
Now, who's your source?

85
00:06:41,516 --> 00:06:44,476
He's on the force.
He's on the Task Force, all right?

86
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:47,980
Look, he's not lying to me.
He was in my wedding.

87
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:49,815
I want to see the report.

88
00:06:50,066 --> 00:06:52,192
- I can't...
- I want to see the fucking 302!

89
00:06:52,443 --> 00:06:55,320
All right, all right.
I'll see what I can do.

90
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,787
It doesn't make any sense.

91
00:07:03,997 --> 00:07:07,499
Yeah, it does, Tone,
if you take the blinders off.

92
00:07:08,585 --> 00:07:13,213
I'm in Homicide. I was told he moved
heavy H to pay for his kid's college.

93
00:07:13,464 --> 00:07:15,799
Why would I know something like that?

94
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:19,011
Last spring, with that
big heroin bust, where was he?

95
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,180
He told you he was
in Las Vegas. Am I right?

96
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:25,434
I'm sorry, but that's where he was.
He was in Las Vegas.

97
00:07:25,686 --> 00:07:28,563
He was in a Federal building,
cutting a deal.

98
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:33,192
Why did he walk so easy
from that thing the other day?

99
00:07:33,444 --> 00:07:35,069
Known wiseguy, resisted arrest.

100
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:38,781
Who walks away from a thing like that
with low-ball bail?

101
00:07:39,783 --> 00:07:41,576
Why would he do it?

102
00:07:42,202 --> 00:07:46,080
He's facing a possible sentence
of "from now on," mandatory.

103
00:07:46,582 --> 00:07:49,834
I know a lot of guys
who can't do that kind of time.

104
00:07:50,044 --> 00:07:51,836
Who is this guy Pussy?

105
00:07:52,046 --> 00:07:55,173
He's a man who loves his family
above all else.

106
00:07:55,382 --> 00:07:58,176
Well, guess what?
That's their favorite target.

107
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:05,058
Ma, you sure?
Because I'd be glad to...

108
00:08:06,894 --> 00:08:08,269
No, I...

109
00:08:09,396 --> 00:08:11,105
Okay, that's fine.

110
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:14,609
I just said it's fine.

111
00:08:22,618 --> 00:08:24,911
- Was that my mother?
- She's not coming.

112
00:08:25,246 --> 00:08:28,165
- Like you expected different?
- I hoped.

113
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:31,502
Every year we have open house,
and she pulls the same shit.

114
00:08:31,753 --> 00:08:33,712
It's negative attention-getting.

115
00:08:33,922 --> 00:08:35,589
Maybe I should call her back.

116
00:08:35,924 --> 00:08:38,425
That's what she wants you to do.
Come here.

117
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:41,261
You're being too nice.

118
00:08:41,513 --> 00:08:43,639
Forget about her, she'll be fine.

119
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:47,518
Can you get the guys to help you
move the piano?

120
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:50,854
They're coming to get it,
because some people don't play.

121
00:08:51,022 --> 00:08:54,274
- I will.
- When? It's been gathering dust.

122
00:08:54,526 --> 00:08:56,652
Oh, Puss! Come here!

123
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,114
Excuse me.

124
00:09:04,452 --> 00:09:05,452
What do you need?

125
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,622
We gotta move this.
I want to slide it out of the way.

126
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:16,296
I can't.

127
00:09:16,548 --> 00:09:18,298
The fucking thing's on wheels.

128
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,302
My back. I'm thinking about
going home, sitting in the tub.

129
00:09:24,305 --> 00:09:25,305
You all right?

130
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:29,184
Yeah, it's just my back.
They got me on these elephant pills.

131
00:09:33,274 --> 00:09:36,276
All right, go easy on them.

132
00:09:36,652 --> 00:09:39,154
Go ahead, sit down. Take it easy.

133
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:50,582
Keep your eye on Pussy.
Something's wrong. He's not himself.

134
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,375
You're telling me?

135
00:09:53,002 --> 00:09:55,253
He hasn't done his rounds
in a week.

136
00:09:55,504 --> 00:09:57,839
He's starting to look like
an easy mark.

137
00:09:58,048 --> 00:10:02,510
I told him, "Someone owes you money,
even if you gotta crawl, you get it."

138
00:10:02,845 --> 00:10:07,098
I even told him to give me his list,
and I'll collect the fucking thing.

139
00:10:07,308 --> 00:10:10,602
- What'd he say?
- He just nodded like a fucking retard.

140
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,187
It's those fucking Percs.

141
00:10:12,438 --> 00:10:14,689
He's throwing them
in his mouth like M&M's.

142
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:17,525
There isn't even anything wrong
with his back.

143
00:10:19,028 --> 00:10:20,028
What do you mean?

144
00:10:20,321 --> 00:10:24,449
Remember when that guy hit me with
a pool cue and I fucked my neck up?

145
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:26,326
- Down at the Shore.
- Right.

146
00:10:26,535 --> 00:10:30,997
I went to this doctor. He works on
the Jets when they get hurt.

147
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,374
That so?

148
00:10:32,626 --> 00:10:35,920
He's fucking like the Jonas Salk
of backs. Anyway...

149
00:10:36,213 --> 00:10:39,507
...I send Pussy to this doctor.
The guy gives him the works:

150
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,302
MRIs, CAT scans, DOG scans,
you name it.

151
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:46,222
He says there's not a thing wrong
with his back.

152
00:10:49,226 --> 00:10:51,769
Then again, he says,
when it comes to backs...

153
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,522
...nobody knows anything, really.

154
00:10:55,023 --> 00:10:57,775
You know, I was on a good run,
and then, boom!

155
00:10:59,402 --> 00:11:01,612
It's like I'm walking
down the street...

156
00:11:02,447 --> 00:11:06,450
...and I'm looking up because I feel
like a safe's gonna land on my head.

157
00:11:06,701 --> 00:11:08,661
A feeling of pending doom?

158
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,704
Let me ask you a question.

159
00:11:11,414 --> 00:11:15,459
This mental stuff can cause
physical problems, right?

160
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,837
Are you having any physical problems?

161
00:11:18,088 --> 00:11:19,630
No, no, I'm fine.

162
00:11:20,507 --> 00:11:22,383
But I got a friend...

163
00:11:23,051 --> 00:11:27,137
...a dear, dear friend,
and I'm concerned about him.

164
00:11:27,305 --> 00:11:28,931
What's wrong with him?

165
00:11:29,099 --> 00:11:30,474
It's his back.

166
00:11:30,977 --> 00:11:34,437
See, he's complaining
about his back...

167
00:11:34,689 --> 00:11:37,065
...but the doctor thinks
it's all in his head.

168
00:11:37,275 --> 00:11:39,401
That's very possible.

169
00:11:40,611 --> 00:11:41,862
What do you think?

170
00:11:42,071 --> 00:11:44,614
I think we should just
keep this about you.

171
00:11:44,866 --> 00:11:46,241
This is about me.

172
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:51,413
Every time I offer my opinion
about any of your friends...

173
00:11:51,622 --> 00:11:55,083
...it seems to interfere
with our therapy.

174
00:11:55,835 --> 00:11:59,004
You start cursing and screaming.

175
00:12:00,464 --> 00:12:03,884
What kind of mental stuff
would cause a backache?

176
00:12:04,135 --> 00:12:06,011
For conversation's sake?

177
00:12:06,262 --> 00:12:07,804
Absolutely.

178
00:12:10,474 --> 00:12:13,059
With some people, the pain is...

179
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:17,689
...caused by more responsibility
than they can handle.

180
00:12:18,608 --> 00:12:20,567
Well, that makes sense. I mean...

181
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:25,196
...he's got a lot of bills, a lot of
problems with his kid's school fund.

182
00:12:25,823 --> 00:12:27,449
Secrets.

183
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:31,202
What do you mean?

184
00:12:31,455 --> 00:12:34,916
Psychologically,
a secret is a heavy load.

185
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:39,295
It leads to feelings of guilt,
which further burden the mind.

186
00:12:51,516 --> 00:12:54,268
If you want my opinion,
this can't be true.

187
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:56,020
Thanks, Debbie.

188
00:13:01,568 --> 00:13:05,071
You know, I told you that
I would do what I could...

189
00:13:05,822 --> 00:13:09,867
...but this is DEA, Feds, Task Force.

190
00:13:10,452 --> 00:13:12,620
This is not as easy as you think.

191
00:13:12,788 --> 00:13:14,705
Getting my hands on the 302.

192
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,624
Now, you listen to me.

193
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,252
This is the most serious decision
I've ever had to make.

194
00:13:20,545 --> 00:13:22,254
And I need proof.

195
00:13:22,881 --> 00:13:26,217
I won't hurt a man that I love
because of some cop gossip...

196
00:13:26,468 --> 00:13:29,387
...from a degenerate fucking gambler
with a badge.

197
00:13:30,013 --> 00:13:33,516
You know, you got
an amazing ability to sum up...

198
00:13:33,726 --> 00:13:36,603
...a man's whole life
in a single sentence.

199
00:13:36,854 --> 00:13:40,232
Degenerate gambler with a badge, huh?

200
00:13:40,817 --> 00:13:43,902
You're a pisser.
You're a real pisser.

201
00:13:44,612 --> 00:13:47,906
I'm under pressure.
I don't have time to suck your dick!

202
00:13:48,908 --> 00:13:50,117
Apology accepted.

203
00:13:50,326 --> 00:13:51,994
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me?

204
00:13:52,203 --> 00:13:53,203
Yeah, fuck you!

205
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:58,000
You know, when I was a kid...

206
00:13:58,626 --> 00:14:02,379
When I was a kid and my old man
would be in one of his ways...

207
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:05,090
...with the screaming
back and forth...

208
00:14:05,383 --> 00:14:08,176
...it'd end with her
throwing the closest thing to her.

209
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:10,887
He'd smack her around!

210
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:15,058
I don't know why...

211
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:19,438
...but I would run into my room,
and I would hide under my bed.

212
00:14:20,606 --> 00:14:25,068
There was something peaceful, and
something safe under that bed.

213
00:14:26,738 --> 00:14:29,448
And that's where I would wake up
the next day.

214
00:14:31,617 --> 00:14:33,160
Everything back to normal.

215
00:14:34,788 --> 00:14:35,913
How about you?

216
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,126
Do you ever feel like
hiding under a bed?

217
00:14:42,796 --> 00:14:44,714
Yeah. Right now.

218
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,721
You're a prick to the end, right?

219
00:14:58,562 --> 00:15:00,396
You really like this place, huh?

220
00:15:01,315 --> 00:15:02,982
It's my getaway.

221
00:15:03,192 --> 00:15:06,110
This is where Debbie's
taken care of me for years.

222
00:15:06,361 --> 00:15:07,987
I'll bet she has.

223
00:15:08,155 --> 00:15:10,364
I'm serious, she has.

224
00:15:10,574 --> 00:15:14,035
There were times when I had
a great weekend with the football...

225
00:15:14,328 --> 00:15:17,705
...and I'd come here with
a pocketful of money, shitfaced...

226
00:15:17,915 --> 00:15:21,709
...and every fucking penny would be
there when I got up in the morning.

227
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:24,504
She is an honest lady.

228
00:15:24,713 --> 00:15:26,839
She'd do anything for you, anything.

229
00:15:27,132 --> 00:15:30,510
You come in here, you flash
your badge, you get free pussy.

230
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:34,680
Fuck pussy. I wouldn't fuck
one of these broads with your dick.

231
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,976
They have absolutely no class,
and they're always on the hustle.

232
00:15:39,354 --> 00:15:41,688
That's what
they're supposed to do, no?

233
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:58,205
"Oh, hello, Carmela.
How nice to see you."

234
00:15:59,707 --> 00:16:01,041
How are you feeling?

235
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,836
Oh, what can I say? What's that?

236
00:16:04,045 --> 00:16:07,047
It's a ricotta pie.
I saved it from the open house.

237
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,841
Are you wearing makeup?

238
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,135
I can't eat that.
It's got cholesterol!

239
00:16:11,386 --> 00:16:14,012
I made it with the low-fat cheese.

240
00:16:15,014 --> 00:16:16,390
Yuck.

241
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:20,060
Well, maybe your friends
will eat it.

242
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,563
What friends?

243
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:25,899
Fine, you can eat it
when Junior visits.

244
00:16:29,237 --> 00:16:31,530
You know,
your son loves you very much.

245
00:16:31,739 --> 00:16:34,074
He worries all the time.

246
00:16:34,325 --> 00:16:37,244
He felt bad that
you didn't come to the open house.

247
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,081
I don't care if
you think it's disrespectful...

248
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,543
...but I want you to cut the drama.
It's killing Tony.

249
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,086
What are you talking about?

250
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:48,798
I'm talking about this
"Poor mother, nobody loves me" crap.

251
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,884
It is textbook manipulation...

252
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,845
...and I hate seeing
Tony so upset over it.

253
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,389
I know how to talk to people.

254
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:59,434
Well, I am a mother too,
don't forget.

255
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:03,313
You know your power,
and you use it like a pro.

256
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:07,775
Power, what power?
I don't have power. I'm a shut-in!

257
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,527
You are bigger than life!

258
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,112
You are his mother!

259
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,073
I think that
you know what you're doing.

260
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,868
Who, me? What did I do?

261
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,246
Look, I didn't come by to argue.

262
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,875
I came by to check on you
and to bring you the ricotta.

263
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:27,921
If you don't want it, give it
to Junior. I know he stops by a lot.

264
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,590
He's my husband's brother.

265
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,843
He can't check up on me
once in a while?

266
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,054
That's none of anybody's business.

267
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,597
I am not saying that.

268
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,600
I'm saying if you don't want it,
give it to Junior.

269
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,978
I know what you're hinting at.

270
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:46,232
Ma, there is nothing wrong
with companionship!

271
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:51,654
What is wrong?

272
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:01,080
Wait until you're abandoned.

273
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,919
Abandoned? Please!

274
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:12,925
When Johnny was alive...

275
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:16,387
...nobody treated me like this.

276
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,473
What are you talking about?
Who is treating you bad?

277
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:22,101
Tony would rather die
than see you hurt.

278
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:25,020
Johnny was a saint.

279
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,313
Yes, we heard.

280
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:29,858
Funny, I don't remember you
telling him that when he was alive.

281
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:33,028
Junior couldn't carry Johnny's socks.

282
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:36,282
Do you think I'd blacken
my Johnny's memory...

283
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:39,702
...by getting mixed up
with his brother?

284
00:18:41,831 --> 00:18:43,456
I didn't say that.

285
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,876
We're only happy
you and Junior get along so well.

286
00:18:47,086 --> 00:18:48,545
At least with Junior...

287
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:54,718
...I've got some purpose in life.

288
00:18:55,428 --> 00:19:00,307
Somebody listens to me,
and doesn't treat me like an old shoe!

289
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:07,856
Jesus!

290
00:19:11,402 --> 00:19:14,779
Don't worry about the dish.
I'll come back tomorrow and get it.

291
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:23,663
Hey, college boy!

292
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:30,795
Yo, Dad! It's Uncle Tony.

293
00:19:35,426 --> 00:19:37,635
There he is, the beached whale!

294
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,638
Hey, Tony, what are you doing here?

295
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:43,641
I figured you'd be having
a cannoli withdrawal by now.

296
00:19:43,977 --> 00:19:44,977
Spinellis?

297
00:19:45,145 --> 00:19:47,605
No, Stop 'N' Shop. What do you think?

298
00:19:47,773 --> 00:19:51,233
Hey, you're the best.
Hey, Kev, put those on a dish.

299
00:19:51,777 --> 00:19:53,611
Wait till after supper.

300
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:57,073
Your dad tells me you're
taking astronomy in college.

301
00:19:57,282 --> 00:19:58,449
No, business.

302
00:19:58,658 --> 00:20:01,744
How come he keeps saying
you're taking up space in school?

303
00:20:02,537 --> 00:20:06,290
Madonna! Don't make me laugh.
It kills my back.

304
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,376
He's a good-looking kid.

305
00:20:08,585 --> 00:20:09,585
Sure he's yours?

306
00:20:09,795 --> 00:20:12,963
You're lucky my wife's not home.
She'd toss you out for that.

307
00:20:13,215 --> 00:20:14,423
I know.

308
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,300
That's a good boy.

309
00:20:16,718 --> 00:20:19,303
I pray to God I keep
that tuition coming in.

310
00:20:19,596 --> 00:20:21,138
He can go to city college.

311
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:25,643
He's staying where he is. He isn't
getting fucked because his old man is!

312
00:20:28,814 --> 00:20:32,608
You ought to relax.
You ought to take it easy a little.

313
00:20:32,818 --> 00:20:35,653
Take it easy.
How the fuck can I take it easy?

314
00:20:35,904 --> 00:20:37,613
Things are happening, Tony.

315
00:20:38,156 --> 00:20:39,407
What kind of things?

316
00:20:39,658 --> 00:20:40,908
Things!

317
00:20:43,037 --> 00:20:45,914
This back has taken me
out of the game. I'm behind.

318
00:20:46,124 --> 00:20:49,626
And I think I'm getting hooked
on these fucking painkillers!

319
00:20:49,836 --> 00:20:52,879
I don't know, I feel like
someone put the malocchio on me.

320
00:20:55,675 --> 00:20:56,800
Puss...

321
00:20:57,635 --> 00:20:59,261
...you got options.

322
00:21:00,263 --> 00:21:02,097
Don't let anyone make you feel...

323
00:21:02,306 --> 00:21:05,267
...like you don't have options
because you got friends.

324
00:21:05,685 --> 00:21:06,935
Look at me.

325
00:21:07,311 --> 00:21:09,396
Friends that would die for you.

326
00:21:09,605 --> 00:21:11,231
You understand me?

327
00:21:11,732 --> 00:21:13,108
Friends.

328
00:21:14,402 --> 00:21:15,652
Yeah, I know.

329
00:21:20,199 --> 00:21:22,576
You got anything
you want to say to me?

330
00:21:24,412 --> 00:21:25,662
Like what?

331
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,586
Like, "You want some coffee?
You want something to eat?"

332
00:21:32,795 --> 00:21:34,796
- You want coffee?
- Yeah.

333
00:21:35,673 --> 00:21:38,633
You think I'd let you eat
those cannolis by yourself?

334
00:21:38,843 --> 00:21:40,218
You beached whale.

335
00:21:40,511 --> 00:21:41,636
- Here.
- What?

336
00:21:41,888 --> 00:21:44,055
Help me.
Who'll make the coffee, you?

337
00:21:44,223 --> 00:21:47,058
One, two, three.

338
00:21:48,979 --> 00:21:50,313
You look good.

339
00:22:13,462 --> 00:22:14,921
What's up, T?

340
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:16,881
Sit.

341
00:22:19,426 --> 00:22:20,718
Fucking traffic!

342
00:22:21,011 --> 00:22:23,221
I would have been here 20 minutes ago.

343
00:22:25,098 --> 00:22:26,182
Want a drink?

344
00:22:26,433 --> 00:22:27,600
Nah.

345
00:22:30,103 --> 00:22:31,103
You okay?

346
00:22:35,108 --> 00:22:36,317
He's wearing a wire.

347
00:22:36,818 --> 00:22:37,985
Who?

348
00:22:38,278 --> 00:22:39,445
Pussy.

349
00:22:39,613 --> 00:22:43,032
Oh, get the fuck out of here.
Our Pussy?

350
00:22:43,534 --> 00:22:45,117
Don't know how long.

351
00:22:45,995 --> 00:22:47,746
Are you sure about this, Tony?

352
00:22:48,998 --> 00:22:50,541
Ninety percent.

353
00:22:52,418 --> 00:22:54,503
Not enough to do
what needs to be done.

354
00:22:54,796 --> 00:22:57,047
Jesus!
I'm fucking dreaming here.

355
00:22:57,257 --> 00:22:59,132
Well, get used to it.

356
00:22:59,634 --> 00:23:02,261
I've been walking into walls all week.

357
00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:10,269
I'll do it.

358
00:23:15,525 --> 00:23:17,484
My responsibility.

359
00:23:18,695 --> 00:23:20,946
You waited a long time
for the stripes.

360
00:23:21,197 --> 00:23:23,115
This is one of the perks.

361
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:25,993
I'll do it.

362
00:23:34,085 --> 00:23:37,254
We need to be 110 percent sure.

363
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:39,923
I want you to see it.

364
00:23:40,466 --> 00:23:43,468
I want you to see that fucking wire
strapped on his body.

365
00:23:43,678 --> 00:23:45,387
I want you to see it.

366
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,055
You hear me?

367
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:48,891
I want you to see it.

368
00:23:50,352 --> 00:23:52,478
Otherwise, all bets are off.

369
00:23:53,731 --> 00:23:55,023
You understand?

370
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:02,447
This is our friend
we're talking about here.

371
00:24:02,698 --> 00:24:04,198
You say it.

372
00:24:05,492 --> 00:24:06,701
You understand?

373
00:24:07,786 --> 00:24:09,370
I understand.

374
00:24:32,645 --> 00:24:33,728
Come in.

375
00:24:36,231 --> 00:24:37,607
Mr. Soprano.

376
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,653
- Are you busy?
- No, no, no. Come in, please.

377
00:24:44,531 --> 00:24:49,202
I was in the neighborhood,
figured I'd stop by and see my mother.

378
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,289
Brought her some Mario Lanza.

379
00:24:52,832 --> 00:24:55,668
She loves the old guys.

380
00:24:59,047 --> 00:25:03,342
I'm a little worried about her.
You know, she's always been depressed.

381
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:07,054
Sometimes these half-assed tenors
can really do the trick.

382
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:15,604
You know where she is?
She's not in her room.

383
00:25:15,897 --> 00:25:18,649
I wanted to tell her
her house went into escrow.

384
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,652
She's with the other girls
getting aqua therapy.

385
00:25:21,945 --> 00:25:23,112
My mother?

386
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:26,824
The physical therapist told her
if she didn't get exercise...

387
00:25:27,117 --> 00:25:29,284
...her back was gonna arch
like an old lady.

388
00:25:29,452 --> 00:25:31,203
I didn't know
she had a bathing suit.

389
00:25:31,454 --> 00:25:33,455
She's more connected to the world.

390
00:25:33,623 --> 00:25:35,457
Which one, this one or Neptune?

391
00:25:36,251 --> 00:25:38,293
No, really.

392
00:25:39,462 --> 00:25:42,965
I think your uncle's visits
have a lot to do with it.

393
00:25:43,258 --> 00:25:44,842
Oh, she looks forward to them.

394
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:47,970
Could you excuse me one moment?

395
00:25:48,471 --> 00:25:51,306
Yeah, sure. You know, just...

396
00:25:51,934 --> 00:25:55,729
Tell her her house sold
and they accepted the counteroffer.

397
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:58,481
Okay. Yeah, I'll be right there.

398
00:25:59,316 --> 00:26:01,735
- I'm leaving, guys.
- See you later, Pussy.

399
00:26:01,986 --> 00:26:05,655
- I'll tell you if a horse runs.
- Don't do me any favors.

400
00:26:37,354 --> 00:26:38,354
Follow me.

401
00:26:39,356 --> 00:26:40,356
Where?

402
00:26:41,025 --> 00:26:42,233
It's a surprise.

403
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:47,655
Come on, you hard-on,
before we get a ticket.

404
00:26:59,211 --> 00:27:02,046
Paulie, I've been here before.
What the fuck you want?

405
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:04,548
Look around,
I'll give you three guesses.

406
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,634
Come on, down here.

407
00:27:10,889 --> 00:27:12,723
We'll grab a rubdown after.

408
00:27:13,558 --> 00:27:14,642
Here.

409
00:27:16,561 --> 00:27:17,686
I don't know.

410
00:27:17,938 --> 00:27:20,397
Come on, get undressed.
It's on me.

411
00:27:21,274 --> 00:27:23,526
Why do you think
those Russians live so long?

412
00:27:23,777 --> 00:27:26,195
They take a schvitz every day.

413
00:27:26,488 --> 00:27:27,655
I can't.

414
00:27:27,864 --> 00:27:31,033
Don't be like that.
It's a gift. Take your clothes off.

415
00:27:31,284 --> 00:27:33,327
What? Want me to turn around?

416
00:27:33,537 --> 00:27:37,748
The doctor said heat's no good for me.
That's why I sit in the shade.

417
00:27:37,999 --> 00:27:41,043
What are you talking about?
Heat is good for your back!

418
00:27:41,294 --> 00:27:43,087
Take your clothes off!

419
00:27:43,588 --> 00:27:46,757
Look, Paulie, I appreciate it.
Maybe another time, huh?

420
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:49,552
Take your clothes off.

421
00:27:51,012 --> 00:27:53,681
You're fucking crazy.
I'm going home.

422
00:27:56,185 --> 00:27:58,937
Why don't you want
to take your clothes off?

423
00:27:59,522 --> 00:28:03,441
I got high blood pressure!
I go in there, I could check out!

424
00:28:03,651 --> 00:28:07,070
My doctor mentioned steam and sauna
specifically as no-noes.

425
00:28:07,321 --> 00:28:09,781
He said stay the fuck
away from heat!

426
00:28:11,284 --> 00:28:14,786
Thanks for the thought.
But get out of my fucking face.

427
00:28:36,642 --> 00:28:37,684
What'd you find out?

428
00:28:37,977 --> 00:28:41,438
It's good. It's fucking very good!

429
00:28:42,189 --> 00:28:43,690
Spit it out.

430
00:28:44,692 --> 00:28:46,192
He's into Pussy, big.

431
00:28:46,485 --> 00:28:48,695
And I mean with a capital B.

432
00:28:48,988 --> 00:28:52,866
This fucking Makazian,
he's a lying motherfucker!

433
00:28:53,075 --> 00:28:57,704
He's into Pussy for 30 large.
Twenty grand, just on football!

434
00:28:57,956 --> 00:28:59,707
And the rest is shy.

435
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,294
Pussy must be burying his prick
in vig alone.

436
00:29:11,178 --> 00:29:13,054
Doesn't mean he's a liar.

437
00:29:13,388 --> 00:29:17,683
Just means he's got a reason to see
Pussy dead. It buys him time.

438
00:29:19,394 --> 00:29:23,356
Could this prick have the balls
to try something like this?

439
00:29:23,607 --> 00:29:26,192
Hey, we're talking about
30 grand here!

440
00:29:26,485 --> 00:29:30,029
I don't even want to think about
what we'd do to remove that debt.

441
00:29:30,238 --> 00:29:32,198
I wouldn't bet football.

442
00:29:36,286 --> 00:29:38,287
I gotta think about this.

443
00:29:39,831 --> 00:29:41,624
Look, T...

444
00:29:42,209 --> 00:29:44,126
...if my vote counts for anything...

445
00:29:44,378 --> 00:29:48,047
...I cannot believe that
Pussy would fear the can enough...

446
00:29:48,298 --> 00:29:50,216
...to hurt his friends.

447
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:54,136
That's what they said about Gravano.

448
00:29:58,226 --> 00:30:00,227
All right, go back in.
I gotta think.

449
00:30:13,658 --> 00:30:14,741
Deb?

450
00:30:17,829 --> 00:30:18,912
Debbie?

451
00:30:28,089 --> 00:30:31,049
- Take it easy with her.
- I'd think a whore would like pain.

452
00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:32,926
- Take it easy!
- Vinnie, stop it!

453
00:30:33,219 --> 00:30:35,637
Come on, let's get
this show on the road!

454
00:30:35,888 --> 00:30:38,640
Look at this. A doctor,
a madam, a wiseguy and a cop.

455
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:41,601
That's what I call a vice superfecta.

456
00:30:47,233 --> 00:30:49,609
The four were arrested last night.

457
00:30:49,777 --> 00:30:53,405
A spokesman says that the officer
in question will be placed on leave...

458
00:30:53,656 --> 00:30:56,533
...pending the outcome
of the hearing this morning.

459
00:30:56,784 --> 00:30:58,744
Hate to be there
when he got home.

460
00:30:58,996 --> 00:31:00,496
I don't know which is worse:

461
00:31:00,748 --> 00:31:04,333
To be caught in a bordello
or to be caught with the wiseguy.

462
00:31:06,045 --> 00:31:07,086
Asshole!

463
00:31:07,463 --> 00:31:10,214
- What's a bordello?
- A fancy name for a whorehouse.

464
00:31:10,424 --> 00:31:11,841
Don't start, okay?

465
00:31:12,051 --> 00:31:13,092
It is!

466
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,136
I just don't like that talk.

467
00:31:15,387 --> 00:31:19,432
Most civilized countries
have legalized prostitution.

468
00:31:19,683 --> 00:31:20,975
You got somewhere to be?

469
00:31:21,185 --> 00:31:23,186
It's a joke, look at the president.

470
00:31:23,479 --> 00:31:24,812
He deserved what he got.

471
00:31:25,022 --> 00:31:27,982
He got Monica Kazinski
and the broad with the long nose.

472
00:31:28,233 --> 00:31:30,318
Sex shouldn't be
a punishable offense.

473
00:31:30,611 --> 00:31:33,696
I don't think sex should be
a punishable offense either.

474
00:31:33,989 --> 00:31:37,992
But talking about sex at the breakfast
table is a punishable offense.

475
00:31:38,243 --> 00:31:39,869
No more sex talk, okay?

476
00:31:40,162 --> 00:31:43,831
It's the '90s, parents are supposed
to discuss sex with their children.

477
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:46,000
But that's where you're wrong.

478
00:31:46,168 --> 00:31:50,004
You see, out there, it's the 1990s,
but in this house...

479
00:31:50,297 --> 00:31:52,006
...it's 1954.

480
00:31:52,633 --> 00:31:55,176
1990s, 1954.

481
00:31:55,427 --> 00:31:58,888
So now and forever, I don't want
to hear any more sex talk.

482
00:32:03,937 --> 00:32:05,395
What's with him?

483
00:32:17,158 --> 00:32:18,367
Keep moving, please.

484
00:32:19,369 --> 00:32:20,786
Come on!

485
00:32:38,388 --> 00:32:40,222
Come on, goddamn it!

486
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:42,224
Come on, let's go, let's go!

487
00:32:42,433 --> 00:32:44,351
Let's go!

488
00:32:53,111 --> 00:32:54,403
Go ahead, detective.

489
00:32:54,696 --> 00:32:58,115
Excuse me, move it out, please.
Got a police officer here.

490
00:32:58,408 --> 00:33:02,035
Move it out! Let's go! Pull up!

491
00:33:04,331 --> 00:33:06,833
Police vehicle! Coming through!

492
00:33:53,255 --> 00:33:56,216
Are you sure? Who told you this?

493
00:33:58,344 --> 00:33:59,510
What?

494
00:34:05,185 --> 00:34:07,228
Yeah, yeah, I'm still here.

495
00:34:08,688 --> 00:34:11,815
All right, thanks.
I'll talk to you later.

496
00:34:15,612 --> 00:34:17,029
You gonna tell me?

497
00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:20,824
The fucking jerk did a header
off the Route 1 bridge.

498
00:34:21,201 --> 00:34:23,285
- Who?
- Makazian.

499
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:25,621
Fuck!

500
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:30,834
There goes our only shot to find out
for sure the truth about Pussy.

501
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:38,676
Well, if it matters, he always said
how much he respected you.

502
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,386
It matters.

503
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:48,519
He helped me out of a lot of jams.
Not just with the law.

504
00:34:50,397 --> 00:34:51,855
What was he thinking?

505
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:55,526
He could've kept his job. He might
have been suspended, that's all.

506
00:34:55,735 --> 00:34:57,278
It's not like he was dealing.

507
00:34:57,821 --> 00:34:59,405
That's not why he did it.

508
00:35:00,073 --> 00:35:03,409
Don't get me wrong,
it was the straw...

509
00:35:03,661 --> 00:35:05,912
...but he was not happy...

510
00:35:06,205 --> 00:35:09,124
...with himself, how he turned out.

511
00:35:09,792 --> 00:35:11,876
What did he come here for, therapy?

512
00:35:13,087 --> 00:35:14,254
You could say that.

513
00:35:14,505 --> 00:35:16,631
Instead of a couch, you use a bed?

514
00:35:16,882 --> 00:35:18,216
It's not a bad deal.

515
00:35:18,426 --> 00:35:20,927
Who wouldn't want to
sleep with their shrink?

516
00:35:24,807 --> 00:35:25,890
What's that mean?

517
00:35:27,852 --> 00:35:31,229
You'd be amazed how easy
it is to open up when you're naked...

518
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,232
...and in the arms
of someone who cares for you.

519
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:39,612
Did he ever mention anything
about my guys to you?

520
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:44,242
He didn't like Paulie.
He thought he was a psycho.

521
00:35:44,577 --> 00:35:46,036
What about Pussy?

522
00:35:46,245 --> 00:35:49,706
He really didn't have much to say
about any of you guys.

523
00:35:52,585 --> 00:35:54,919
Except that he owed some money.

524
00:35:55,254 --> 00:35:58,006
But he wasn't worried because
you liked him...

525
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,887
...and while he had you in his corner,
there was nothing to worry about.

526
00:36:05,265 --> 00:36:09,894
I won't lie, he's dead. He didn't
have a good thing to say about anyone.

527
00:36:10,562 --> 00:36:12,938
He did feel like he could trust you.

528
00:36:16,109 --> 00:36:20,905
He said a lot, "At least with Tony
Soprano, you know where you stand."

529
00:36:29,414 --> 00:36:32,333
Livia, open up, it's Junior!

530
00:36:33,251 --> 00:36:35,711
Come on in, it's open.

531
00:36:38,715 --> 00:36:40,299
What's going on?

532
00:36:40,759 --> 00:36:43,219
My Dominican girl said you called me.

533
00:36:44,304 --> 00:36:45,679
Well...

534
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:48,808
...he sold our house.

535
00:36:49,059 --> 00:36:52,311
- Don't people have names? Who's "he"?
- Anthony.

536
00:36:52,687 --> 00:36:55,106
He sold my house!

537
00:36:55,315 --> 00:36:58,401
The home my husband and I made!

538
00:36:58,902 --> 00:37:01,112
What else were they gonna do with it?

539
00:37:01,822 --> 00:37:02,988
You too!

540
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,698
Hey.

541
00:37:06,661 --> 00:37:10,956
I suppose he would've found it harder
to have his meetings at my house...

542
00:37:11,207 --> 00:37:13,208
...than in this nursing home.

543
00:37:13,501 --> 00:37:15,335
What are you talking about?

544
00:37:15,586 --> 00:37:18,839
Don't think I'll ever see
any of that money, either.

545
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:20,173
What meetings?

546
00:37:20,341 --> 00:37:22,300
Raymond, Larry!

547
00:37:22,635 --> 00:37:25,053
That sneak from Manhattan.

548
00:37:25,513 --> 00:37:27,681
Johnny Sack? Johnny Sack was here?

549
00:37:27,974 --> 00:37:30,851
With his mohair suits
and his shoe lifts.

550
00:37:31,185 --> 00:37:33,395
Suits, pleurisy?

551
00:37:34,021 --> 00:37:37,357
More than once he was there?
Why didn't I know about this?

552
00:37:37,692 --> 00:37:41,111
Maybe it was you they were
talking about, who knows?

553
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:53,290
Well, I just don't like being put
in the middle of things!

554
00:37:54,792 --> 00:37:57,294
I should've known
something was strange...

555
00:37:57,587 --> 00:38:01,798
...when suddenly Larry Boy's
mother moved in here.

556
00:38:02,592 --> 00:38:05,385
And then Jimmy Altieri's mother.

557
00:38:06,012 --> 00:38:08,221
Three of my capos
have their moms here?

558
00:38:08,474 --> 00:38:12,310
Instead of living in normal homes
with their sons...

559
00:38:12,603 --> 00:38:14,061
...like human beings.

560
00:38:14,313 --> 00:38:16,856
This must be some kind
of fucking end move.

561
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,026
What do they think, I'm stupid?

562
00:38:20,235 --> 00:38:21,944
- We'll see.
- Wait a minute!

563
00:38:23,489 --> 00:38:25,907
I don't like that kind of talk!

564
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,659
Now just stop it, it upsets me!

565
00:38:30,412 --> 00:38:32,622
Or I won't tell you anything anymore.

566
00:38:32,873 --> 00:38:37,084
If this is true, Livia,
you know what I... I mean...

567
00:38:37,586 --> 00:38:42,131
I'm the boss, for chrissake!
If I don't act, blood or no...

568
00:38:50,682 --> 00:38:52,099
I have to.

569
00:38:52,309 --> 00:38:54,810
Oh, God, why?

570
00:38:55,229 --> 00:38:57,897
What did I say now?

571
00:39:03,487 --> 00:39:08,324
I suppose I should've just kept
my mouth shut, like a mute.

572
00:39:08,617 --> 00:39:11,619
And then everybody
would've been happy.

573
00:39:22,966 --> 00:39:24,716
Anthony, see who's there.

574
00:39:25,009 --> 00:39:26,134
I'm eating.

575
00:39:26,427 --> 00:39:29,638
You won't have any teeth left
if you don't go see!

576
00:39:36,229 --> 00:39:38,647
Make sure you know who it is
before you answer.

577
00:39:38,982 --> 00:39:41,608
Who is coming at dinner?
People can't call?

578
00:39:43,278 --> 00:39:44,653
It's Uncle Jimmy!

579
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,656
Uncle Jimmy? Let him in!

580
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,830
I don't believe it,
how'd you get out?

581
00:39:55,331 --> 00:39:57,499
Carm, look who's here!
Jimmy, he's out!

582
00:39:57,834 --> 00:39:59,626
Oh, my God, Jimmy!

583
00:39:59,836 --> 00:40:02,337
- Thought you'd never see me again?
- What happened?

584
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:06,216
- Got someplace in private we can talk?
- Yeah, in the basement.

585
00:40:10,847 --> 00:40:12,472
What's going on?

586
00:40:15,144 --> 00:40:16,644
You got a problem!

587
00:40:18,397 --> 00:40:21,274
Yeah, I know. I'm working on it.

588
00:40:21,525 --> 00:40:23,109
Working on what?

589
00:40:24,028 --> 00:40:25,862
Why, what were you gonna say?

590
00:40:26,071 --> 00:40:28,865
You better lay low
with that safe-house money.

591
00:40:29,158 --> 00:40:30,241
What?

592
00:40:30,492 --> 00:40:33,328
They were asking me
a lot of questions in there.

593
00:40:33,537 --> 00:40:37,498
If I knew anything about the dead
Colombian in the apartment.

594
00:40:42,546 --> 00:40:44,213
You look good.

595
00:40:44,882 --> 00:40:48,718
- Thanks, I wasn't gone that long.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

596
00:40:49,678 --> 00:40:53,056
My lawyer told him,
"Hey, he doesn't own the building.

597
00:40:53,349 --> 00:40:55,850
He's not responsible
for what's in it."

598
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:59,562
I told him the pool table was there
when I first rented the joint.

599
00:41:00,481 --> 00:41:01,856
Good thinking.

600
00:41:02,066 --> 00:41:03,816
You should've been a lawyer.

601
00:41:04,443 --> 00:41:07,695
Please, enough people hate me.

602
00:41:09,448 --> 00:41:13,451
So what are you gonna do
about the Colombian money?

603
00:41:17,457 --> 00:41:20,000
They were putting it to me
like I was a kid.

604
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:22,211
Telling me the money was marked.

605
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:27,257
They said there's a new fingerprint
technique, lifts them off the bills.

606
00:41:31,846 --> 00:41:33,847
You're a lucky man, Jimmy!

607
00:41:34,057 --> 00:41:35,307
What do you mean?

608
00:41:35,558 --> 00:41:38,060
You're out on bail
on that conspiracy thing?

609
00:41:38,228 --> 00:41:39,353
Yeah, so?

610
00:41:39,521 --> 00:41:43,107
Only you would get pinched with a gun
while you're out on bail...

611
00:41:43,316 --> 00:41:45,442
...and still be out
in time for dinner.

612
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,113
You're a lucky guy!

613
00:41:49,698 --> 00:41:52,658
Speaking of dinner, Carmela's
got some lasagna upstairs.

614
00:41:52,867 --> 00:41:56,787
I'll pass. I got a few people
to see that are late with payments.

615
00:41:57,038 --> 00:42:00,624
I gotta show my face or they'll
think they're off the hook.

616
00:42:09,551 --> 00:42:10,551
Get off the phone!

617
00:42:10,844 --> 00:42:12,094
I gotta go!

618
00:42:12,345 --> 00:42:15,472
- What's up?
- It's Jimmy! It's fucking Jimmy!

619
00:42:15,683 --> 00:42:16,850
What?

620
00:42:17,059 --> 00:42:20,186
- The wire, it's Jimmy!
- What are you talking about?

621
00:42:20,646 --> 00:42:24,149
The wire, you understand?
The wire, it's fucking Jimmy!

622
00:42:25,443 --> 00:42:28,820
I should've killed him
right in my fucking basement!

623
00:42:29,029 --> 00:42:32,490
Makazian's guy got mixed up.
They got busted at the same time.

624
00:42:32,825 --> 00:42:35,827
Jimmy and Pussy! You understand?

625
00:42:37,496 --> 00:42:40,915
Two fat fucks with black hair!
Where the fuck is Paulie?

626
00:42:41,667 --> 00:42:44,502
He called an hour ago.
He said he's on his way.

627
00:42:44,837 --> 00:42:46,838
Why the fuck isn't he here now?

628
00:42:49,049 --> 00:42:50,842
Jesus, Tony.

629
00:42:51,051 --> 00:42:53,845
You don't think Paulie
jumped the gun?

630
00:42:54,013 --> 00:42:55,847
Shut up. God forbid.

631
00:42:56,056 --> 00:42:58,057
Don't talk like that.

632
00:42:59,226 --> 00:43:02,020
Where's Pussy? Get him on the phone.

633
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,901
I haven't seen him since
Paulie took him to the schvitz.

634
00:43:08,068 --> 00:43:09,068
Hey, fellas!

635
00:43:12,072 --> 00:43:14,824
I've been calling you
all fucking night long!

636
00:43:15,034 --> 00:43:17,702
I was at my goomar's.
I told Silvio I was coming.

637
00:43:18,413 --> 00:43:21,248
You answer me like
I'm Jesus Christ himself...

638
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,376
...if you lie, may your mother
die of cancer of the eyes.

639
00:43:27,631 --> 00:43:29,840
- Where's Pussy?
- I don't know.

640
00:43:30,217 --> 00:43:32,468
- Don't you fucking lie to me!
- Tony!

641
00:43:35,806 --> 00:43:37,056
Did you do it?

642
00:43:37,724 --> 00:43:39,391
- Tony.
- Shh.

643
00:43:39,601 --> 00:43:41,435
Don't fucking lie to me.

644
00:43:44,105 --> 00:43:46,357
- Did you do it?
- No.

645
00:43:46,608 --> 00:43:48,651
- Did you fucking do it?
- No.

646
00:43:49,402 --> 00:43:50,736
Did you fucking do it?

647
00:43:51,029 --> 00:43:55,032
I said no! Now get your
fucking hands off of me.

648
00:43:55,242 --> 00:43:56,867
Come on, Tony.

649
00:43:58,078 --> 00:43:59,411
Come on.

650
00:44:18,266 --> 00:44:20,016
I'm sorry, Paulie.

651
00:44:22,562 --> 00:44:25,021
I can't find Pussy anywhere!

652
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,275
Nobody knows anything!

653
00:44:29,277 --> 00:44:31,862
I haven't seen him since the schvitz.

654
00:44:32,738 --> 00:44:37,242
The last thing he said to me was,
"Go fuck yourself!"

655
00:44:38,202 --> 00:44:40,412
Did he at least take the schvitz?

656
00:44:43,875 --> 00:44:46,835
He refused to take his clothes off.

657
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:53,925
The rat...

658
00:44:54,427 --> 00:44:56,052
...it's fucking Jimmy!

659
00:45:01,017 --> 00:45:04,561
Fuck it! Let's all have a drink!

660
00:45:14,447 --> 00:45:16,031
All right.

661
00:45:16,657 --> 00:45:18,283
Hey, babe!

662
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:23,414
Look what Chucky brought us!

663
00:45:23,874 --> 00:45:27,710
Another kitchen appliance.
Whoop-fucking-pee!

664
00:45:28,003 --> 00:45:30,212
Well, slit your wrists, why don't ya?

665
00:45:30,422 --> 00:45:33,215
Truckload fell off
the loading dock at Zim's.

666
00:45:33,508 --> 00:45:36,010
It's not even a Bra-oon.

667
00:45:37,054 --> 00:45:38,679
That's a "Braun," babe.

668
00:45:39,014 --> 00:45:41,223
Junior said for me to tell you...

669
00:45:41,475 --> 00:45:43,851
...he's decided on that thing.

670
00:45:44,061 --> 00:45:47,021
He said we should look out of town
for who's gonna do it.

671
00:45:47,522 --> 00:45:48,689
- Finally.
- Yeah.

672
00:45:51,193 --> 00:45:52,693
It's gonna be a busy month.

673
00:45:52,945 --> 00:45:54,862
- I'll see you.
- See you later.

674
00:45:55,906 --> 00:45:57,031
See you, Jo.

675
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,866
Yeah, see you.

676
00:46:03,205 --> 00:46:04,872
What was he talking about?

677
00:46:06,041 --> 00:46:09,001
- Mind your business.
- Whatever it is, Mikey...

678
00:46:09,169 --> 00:46:10,878
...we're going to Vegas.

679
00:46:11,129 --> 00:46:14,715
I already lined up childcare,
so I don't want to hear it.

680
00:46:14,925 --> 00:46:17,343
Forget it, something's come up.

681
00:46:19,346 --> 00:46:21,138
Something always comes up.

682
00:46:21,391 --> 00:46:23,475
This is a good something.

683
00:46:23,726 --> 00:46:26,687
Hope it means more money
because I need a new car.

684
00:46:26,854 --> 00:46:27,854
Trust me.

685
00:46:28,398 --> 00:46:31,566
If this goes down, you'll
have a new car, and then some.

686
00:46:33,611 --> 00:46:34,820
Can you tell me?

687
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:39,491
Oh, come on, Mikey! Tell me.

688
00:46:39,909 --> 00:46:41,326
Come on, please?

689
00:46:44,163 --> 00:46:47,082
I may be getting bumped up,
a notch or two!

690
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:51,920
Tony Soprano's on his way out,
and I mean as in "forever."

691
00:46:52,338 --> 00:46:54,256
Oh, my God!

692
00:46:54,549 --> 00:46:55,841
He's going to jail?

693
00:46:56,092 --> 00:46:58,010
No, the other forever!

694
00:46:59,345 --> 00:47:00,595
Does Junior know?

695
00:47:01,347 --> 00:47:03,015
Oh, Jesus!

696
00:47:03,516 --> 00:47:06,768
Listen, if you breathe
a word of this to anybody...

697
00:47:06,936 --> 00:47:10,814
...they'll bury me and you right
next to Tony Soprano, understand?

698
00:47:11,524 --> 00:47:12,733
- Yeah.
- Okay.

699
00:47:12,942 --> 00:47:14,693
Make it decaf.

700
00:47:19,407 --> 00:47:22,200
You don't belittle a man
like Junior Soprano.

701
00:47:22,453 --> 00:47:23,786
He's old-school.

702
00:47:24,038 --> 00:47:26,998
You don't joke about cunt-lapping,
and you don't...

703
00:47:27,249 --> 00:47:31,502
...spill your guts out to a shrink
about business that isn't yours!

704
00:47:31,754 --> 00:47:33,629
Tony Soprano sees a shrink?

705
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,966
You fucking believe that?
To add insult to injury...

706
00:47:37,134 --> 00:47:39,510
...he was planning a move
against Junior!

707
00:47:39,803 --> 00:47:41,220
His own uncle?

708
00:47:43,766 --> 00:47:46,309
Were you this stupid
when I married you?

709
00:47:47,019 --> 00:47:48,061
Fuck you!

710
00:47:48,312 --> 00:47:51,898
No, fuck you. What are you doing
standing there? Make the coffee!

711
00:47:52,149 --> 00:47:55,151
Take it easy, take it easy.
It's brewing.


1
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:49,577
Junior, hey.

2
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:51,413
Jimmy, how you doing, kid?

3
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:53,790
How many of these things
we gotta go to?

4
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:56,876
Filone's mom at the kid's
funeral, the way she carried on.

5
00:01:57,294 --> 00:01:58,461
Fucking manners.

6
00:01:58,671 --> 00:02:02,549
I want you to know I always thought
you had that right too. You know?

7
00:02:02,841 --> 00:02:06,969
Jimmy, let me tell you something.
Don't worry about what I know.

8
00:02:18,106 --> 00:02:20,149
I was just over to Tony's house.

9
00:02:20,358 --> 00:02:23,193
Oh, yeah? How was he?

10
00:02:24,153 --> 00:02:25,945
He looked...

11
00:02:26,321 --> 00:02:27,572
...tired.

12
00:02:28,866 --> 00:02:30,408
Maybe he's got hypoglycemia.

13
00:02:30,742 --> 00:02:33,578
- Maybe he's depressed.
- What's he depressed about?

14
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:35,746
He talked to me about it.

15
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:38,958
- Depression?
- Well...

16
00:02:39,251 --> 00:02:41,210
What do you know about depression?

17
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:46,215
Nothing, but he sleeps all the time,
he's not taking care of himself...

18
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,049
Top guys have dark moods.

19
00:02:48,384 --> 00:02:52,053
Winston Churchill drank a quart of
brandy before breakfast.

20
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:55,056
And Napoleon,
he was a moody fuck too.

21
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:05,567
Am I nuts? A day at the mall
in mules and I'll be crippled for life.

22
00:03:10,614 --> 00:03:14,950
I told Lilliana to put some
giambotto in the microwave for you.

23
00:03:15,952 --> 00:03:20,581
How are you fixed for sweat socks?
We'll be by the Sports Authority.

24
00:03:24,002 --> 00:03:25,044
Tony?

25
00:03:26,837 --> 00:03:29,797
I know you're in there!
I know you hear me!

26
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:31,299
Will you let me sleep?

27
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,428
Does your therapist know about this?
Maybe you need more medication.

28
00:03:35,638 --> 00:03:38,139
She's got me on lithium
and Prozac. What else?

29
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,308
Aromatherapy, something.

30
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:42,060
This is not normal...

31
00:03:42,353 --> 00:03:45,021
...for a healthy adult male to take
to bed like this.

32
00:03:45,814 --> 00:03:46,981
I got a lot on my mind.

33
00:03:47,232 --> 00:03:49,316
Oh, really? Well, move over, then.

34
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,070
Those indictments are hanging over
my head too.

35
00:03:53,363 --> 00:03:56,448
Plus I got the roots in
the pipe to the street.

36
00:03:56,658 --> 00:04:01,119
My best friend, Pussy, has disappeared.
He's probably fucking dead, okay?

37
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:05,165
This downturn started long before
Pussy Bompensiero disappeared.

38
00:04:09,002 --> 00:04:11,879
If you want me, I will be at
the Paramus Mall...

39
00:04:12,297 --> 00:04:17,093
...getting your son a suit to wear
to his first formal.

40
00:04:24,977 --> 00:04:26,352
Carmela, come on!

41
00:04:26,603 --> 00:04:28,187
Sunlight is good for people.

42
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,316
In Alaska, they wear little light hats
so they don't get depressed.

43
00:06:37,895 --> 00:06:39,145
Sorry, Junior.

44
00:06:40,313 --> 00:06:42,523
The Jackson Street Bridge was up.

45
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:44,191
If you say you'll be someplace...

46
00:06:44,359 --> 00:06:46,485
- ...be someplace!
- Sorry.

47
00:06:47,153 --> 00:06:48,946
Junior, you all right?

48
00:06:49,197 --> 00:06:52,116
Pork-chop boy was here.
That fucking Altieri!

49
00:06:53,702 --> 00:06:56,245
Running his mouth about
the Brendan Filone hit.

50
00:06:56,538 --> 00:06:59,915
Is that what him and my capos
talk about behind my back?

51
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,251
The meeting's adjourned at
the Green Grove.

52
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:04,919
Chucky and I spoke to Donnie P.,
and the thing...

53
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,255
...it's happening tomorrow.

54
00:07:08,048 --> 00:07:09,340
That quick? Good.

55
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:11,843
Yeah. Black guys.

56
00:07:12,136 --> 00:07:13,886
It'll never lead back.

57
00:07:14,138 --> 00:07:16,389
They got a pisciatoio in this place?

58
00:07:19,184 --> 00:07:20,393
Look at her like that.

59
00:07:20,644 --> 00:07:24,564
Mariolina gave me my first hand job.
Me and Vincent Miniscalco...

60
00:07:24,856 --> 00:07:27,399
...in the alley behind
the chicken market.

61
00:07:27,942 --> 00:07:30,986
What am I saying
at this poor woman's wake?

62
00:07:31,571 --> 00:07:34,072
I wanted to let you know
so you don't worry.

63
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:37,075
Everything's taken care of about Tony.

64
00:07:38,995 --> 00:07:40,704
When I was a little kid
like that...

65
00:07:40,955 --> 00:07:44,166
...I always used to wonder why nobody
collected prayer cards...

66
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:46,918
...like they collect baseball cards.

67
00:07:47,753 --> 00:07:51,672
Thousands of bucks for Honus Wagner...

68
00:07:51,882 --> 00:07:53,299
...and jack shit for Jesus.

69
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,677
It's going down at a newsstand
by the medical center.

70
00:07:56,928 --> 00:08:00,723
Where he spills his guts on some
fucking shrink's carpet.

71
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:04,351
Junior, these guys are very, very good.

72
00:08:04,644 --> 00:08:09,023
Donnie Paduana did time with them at
Rahway. And I was very specific.

73
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:12,859
He's not gonna suffer. He'll have
an open casket, I promise.

74
00:08:13,068 --> 00:08:16,154
Enough! I don't want
to hear anymore!

75
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,157
Jesus, Michael,
if I delegate, I delegate.

76
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:23,203
Is that what time it is?

77
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:29,000
There is absolutely nothing on the
street about the big guy, anywhere.

78
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:34,880
I went to see his family.

79
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:39,510
Angela doesn't know shit, or she
deserves an Academy fucking Award.

80
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,553
His goomar either.

81
00:08:42,013 --> 00:08:44,932
I don't wanna hear no more talking
about Pussy.

82
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:49,311
Mr. Tony, let me take that robe
and wash it for you.

83
00:08:49,728 --> 00:08:51,813
Did I ask you to take the robe?

84
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:00,488
Jimmy Altieri was in the Bing.

85
00:09:01,532 --> 00:09:04,033
Can't even look him
in the face anymore.

86
00:09:05,285 --> 00:09:07,286
If he's wired, it's doing jack shit...

87
00:09:07,538 --> 00:09:10,122
...because all we feed him is
deliberate bullshit...

88
00:09:10,374 --> 00:09:12,959
...till we can, you know...

89
00:09:13,668 --> 00:09:15,961
Don't do nothing about Jimmy.

90
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,047
I don't even know if he's
the guy that flipped.

91
00:09:21,175 --> 00:09:23,176
I don't know nothing no more.

92
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:30,100
Pussy probably freaked out and he's
lamming it, that's all.

93
00:09:33,895 --> 00:09:36,146
How many times do I gotta say it?

94
00:09:41,194 --> 00:09:43,904
- You want me to drive you somewhere?
- No.

95
00:09:44,155 --> 00:09:45,781
I usually drive you.

96
00:09:47,909 --> 00:09:50,411
- I'm going downstairs.
- What are you gonna do?

97
00:09:50,662 --> 00:09:53,873
I'm gonna get my pants out of
the fucking drier, okay?

98
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,033
- Hello.
- Hi.

99
00:10:31,242 --> 00:10:34,328
Is this yours?
I found it in the yard.

100
00:10:35,038 --> 00:10:36,830
Oh, no. Really?

101
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,375
Thought the Cusamanos were away.

102
00:10:42,044 --> 00:10:44,921
Yeah, they went in Bermuda
to play golf.

103
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:48,925
You're from Italy, aren't you?

104
00:10:49,635 --> 00:10:52,845
- My English is pitiful.
- No.

105
00:10:53,221 --> 00:10:54,847
You speak very good.

106
00:10:56,266 --> 00:10:58,601
Your English is better than
my Italian.

107
00:10:59,936 --> 00:11:01,353
Principles of Oral Surgery?

108
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,771
I'm a student.

109
00:11:03,022 --> 00:11:07,359
I'm here as part of a exchange program
between our two countries.

110
00:11:07,944 --> 00:11:12,155
Boy, if my dentist looked like you
I'd stay awake during a root canal.

111
00:11:12,698 --> 00:11:14,616
All right...

112
00:11:14,867 --> 00:11:16,534
...I'll let you study.

113
00:11:17,203 --> 00:11:20,538
Thank you for bring me...
Come si dice "biancheria"?

114
00:11:20,706 --> 00:11:22,958
I don't know how to say in English.

115
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,209
Well, that makes two of us.

116
00:11:28,505 --> 00:11:29,630
Bye.

117
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:15,966
That's him.

118
00:12:18,386 --> 00:12:21,304
Remember, they don't want
nothing above the neck.

119
00:12:25,101 --> 00:12:26,101
Let's do it.

120
00:12:28,395 --> 00:12:29,520
Whoa.

121
00:12:34,484 --> 00:12:36,986
Doughnuts?
No wonder he can't lose weight.

122
00:12:37,237 --> 00:12:39,155
Where's he going now?

123
00:12:43,535 --> 00:12:44,618
Yo, sir?

124
00:12:44,911 --> 00:12:46,120
- Excuse me.
- What?

125
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:48,122
Could you pull forward?

126
00:12:48,372 --> 00:12:51,249
- Give me a minute.
- Police department.

127
00:12:51,917 --> 00:12:52,959
Where's your badge?

128
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,211
I said move this piece of shit, now!

129
00:12:55,504 --> 00:12:57,922
Get the fuck out of my face.

130
00:13:04,096 --> 00:13:06,473
We'll have to waste this
motherfucker too?

131
00:13:06,682 --> 00:13:09,768
Let him get his doughnuts.
We'll pop him when he gets out.

132
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,329
Where's he going?

133
00:13:30,621 --> 00:13:33,331
See if he left his motherfucking keys
in the car.

134
00:13:43,884 --> 00:13:45,343
This is fucked up.

135
00:13:54,018 --> 00:13:56,144
No. No.

136
00:13:56,354 --> 00:13:59,147
Jesus, you make a left
at the stop sign.

137
00:13:59,357 --> 00:14:01,733
You must be looking at us.
What are you, Ray Charles?

138
00:14:01,901 --> 00:14:02,943
Jesus Christ!

139
00:14:03,194 --> 00:14:05,153
How could it not
have gone down?

140
00:14:05,363 --> 00:14:07,364
I know, Junior. I'm sorry.

141
00:14:07,657 --> 00:14:11,576
Some civilian got in the way.
Donnie will explain it to us.

142
00:14:11,869 --> 00:14:13,286
I wanted it to be over.

143
00:14:13,538 --> 00:14:14,788
I know.

144
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,705
Junior, mints?

145
00:14:26,091 --> 00:14:28,509
We've been fucking
standing around here forever.

146
00:14:28,718 --> 00:14:31,011
You don't think we got
better things to do?

147
00:14:31,221 --> 00:14:33,097
What the fuck, man?

148
00:14:35,516 --> 00:14:37,892
They'll do it tomorrow.
My personal guarantee.

149
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:40,603
Let me tell you something, Donnie.
If they don't...

150
00:14:40,896 --> 00:14:44,023
...some hikers are gonna find your
personal guarantee rolled up...

151
00:14:44,275 --> 00:14:45,692
...and shoved up your ass.

152
00:14:45,901 --> 00:14:48,903
Mike, they got blocked in.
There were witnesses.

153
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,156
- Tomorrow.
- What did I just say?

154
00:14:51,365 --> 00:14:54,617
I already talked to them.
I realize it's urgent.

155
00:14:55,202 --> 00:14:57,370
I heard Tony's own mother
wants him popped.

156
00:14:58,246 --> 00:14:59,621
Who the fuck told you that?

157
00:14:59,831 --> 00:15:01,707
I don't know. It's just a joke.

158
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,001
You think that's funny,
a guy's own mother?

159
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:05,210
Okay, okay.

160
00:15:05,378 --> 00:15:06,503
Tomorrow!

161
00:15:06,838 --> 00:15:08,422
Fucking A!

162
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,757
All right.

163
00:15:21,143 --> 00:15:24,312
I don't like it.
This fucking guy's big mouth.

164
00:15:24,605 --> 00:15:26,981
- No, he's okay.
- I don't like it!

165
00:15:27,274 --> 00:15:29,734
Next they'll be making jokes
about me.

166
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:35,323
Chucky! Tell him to wait a minute.

167
00:15:36,783 --> 00:15:38,951
Yo, Donnie! Hold on a minute.

168
00:15:41,662 --> 00:15:42,996
Hey, Donnie.

169
00:15:44,373 --> 00:15:45,790
Sorry!

170
00:16:07,354 --> 00:16:08,812
Are you still taking the lithium?

171
00:16:09,105 --> 00:16:13,859
Lithium. Prozac.
When's it gonna end?

172
00:16:14,486 --> 00:16:16,862
We're trying to give a jolt
to your system.

173
00:16:17,155 --> 00:16:18,489
Give it...

174
00:16:19,491 --> 00:16:20,699
...a little kick start.

175
00:16:21,076 --> 00:16:22,660
Why not kick me in the head?

176
00:16:22,827 --> 00:16:25,663
What you're going through is very
painful, I know that.

177
00:16:25,913 --> 00:16:28,665
You get stabbed in the ribs,
that's painful.

178
00:16:28,832 --> 00:16:32,001
This shit, I don't feel nothing.

179
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,087
Nothing.

180
00:16:34,797 --> 00:16:37,840
Dead. Empty.

181
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:43,263
What else?

182
00:16:47,475 --> 00:16:49,935
- What?
- What were you just thinking about?

183
00:16:51,354 --> 00:16:53,855
This gorgeous piece of cooz...

184
00:16:54,148 --> 00:16:58,151
...next door to Cusamano's. She's
staying there while they're away.

185
00:16:58,361 --> 00:16:59,987
You do feel something?

186
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,032
Don't split hairs with me
because I've had it with you.

187
00:17:04,409 --> 00:17:08,078
Like King Midas in reverse,
everything I touch turns to shit.

188
00:17:08,704 --> 00:17:12,915
I'm not a husband to my wife.
I'm not a father to my kids.

189
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:16,419
I'm not a friend to my friends.
I'm nothing.

190
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:21,549
I don't even know why I come here.

191
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:25,511
Nothing else to do.

192
00:17:25,762 --> 00:17:29,640
Do you think it would help if you went
someplace to rest up awhile?

193
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:32,642
- You mean like Vegas?
- No, not Vegas.

194
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:35,770
- A place where you'd be looked after.
- Like a hospital?

195
00:17:36,105 --> 00:17:40,859
- With padded rooms and straitjackets?
- No. No straitjackets.

196
00:17:41,068 --> 00:17:43,361
A residential treatment center.

197
00:17:43,571 --> 00:17:45,905
Any idea what my life
would be worth...

198
00:17:46,115 --> 00:17:48,908
...if people knew I was
in a laughing academy?

199
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:50,577
Your life is boxing us in.

200
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:53,078
I'll take a gun and blow my head off.

201
00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:56,415
If that's what you're saying,
you should be hospitalized.

202
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:57,583
Oh, yeah?

203
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:01,045
You get a couple of guys,
come to my house, try it.

204
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:04,131
All right.

205
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:09,803
I'm gonna push the Prozac
to 60 milligrams.

206
00:18:10,347 --> 00:18:11,889
Sure, why not?

207
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:27,320
Hey, is that you?

208
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,031
Ciao!

209
00:18:30,449 --> 00:18:31,741
Look who's here.

210
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:34,285
I was just talking about you.
No kidding.

211
00:18:34,535 --> 00:18:35,702
What are you doing here?

212
00:18:35,953 --> 00:18:40,457
Have the class in gum grafting
alla scuola. I just finish.

213
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:45,045
Let me ask you. This sandwich,
it says it's a "hero."

214
00:18:45,338 --> 00:18:47,714
Why do they call a sandwich "hero"?

215
00:18:48,383 --> 00:18:50,467
- You don't want to eat that.
- No?

216
00:18:51,469 --> 00:18:52,761
Come on.

217
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,888
- What's your name?
- Isabella.

218
00:18:55,138 --> 00:18:57,348
I'm Tony.

219
00:18:57,557 --> 00:18:59,892
- You never went in Italy.
- No.

220
00:19:00,143 --> 00:19:02,895
Why no? You don't want to go?

221
00:19:03,605 --> 00:19:06,690
I guess I just never got off my ass.
Excuse my French.

222
00:19:06,983 --> 00:19:07,983
Your French?

223
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,194
It's an expression.

224
00:19:12,322 --> 00:19:14,824
And where are your people from?

225
00:19:15,242 --> 00:19:17,076
Wait a minute, don't tell me.

226
00:19:21,497 --> 00:19:23,415
- Avellino?
- How'd you know that?

227
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,875
I didn't. I guessed it.

228
00:19:26,085 --> 00:19:28,920
You look like this guy from there.

229
00:19:29,171 --> 00:19:31,423
He came after the earthquake...

230
00:19:31,674 --> 00:19:32,882
...to repair...

231
00:19:34,468 --> 00:19:37,512
How do you say the seat
of the house?

232
00:19:37,846 --> 00:19:39,221
I love how you say that.

233
00:19:40,515 --> 00:19:41,640
"Hearthquake."

234
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,642
You are making a joke.

235
00:19:43,893 --> 00:19:46,186
No. No, I'm sorry.

236
00:19:46,896 --> 00:19:48,188
Go ahead.

237
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,733
Fondamenta. Do you understand?
Fondamenta?

238
00:19:52,068 --> 00:19:53,068
Foundation.

239
00:19:53,236 --> 00:19:57,030
Foundation, sì. Foundation was
cracked, and he repaired the stone.

240
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,493
My grandfather was a stonemason.
He was Avellinese, him and his brother.

241
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:05,580
You should visit Avellino if
your family come from there.

242
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:09,500
There isn't too much left
because of the many earthquake.

243
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:14,505
But from the 17th century, is
still there a beautiful palazzo.

244
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:16,507
Palazzo della Dogana.

245
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:20,887
And there is a place in
the corner of the piazza...

246
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:25,599
...a wine bar. You can sit.
You can see the hills.

247
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,517
And when is spring...

248
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:31,897
...you can smell the blossom
from the lemon trees.

249
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,524
And there is a church with a bell.

250
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:39,571
And they say when it rings,
that means that a baby...

251
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:44,117
...was conceived in the town.

252
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:02,760
Antonio.

253
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:19,776
Tony?

254
00:21:22,488 --> 00:21:23,696
Tony?

255
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:28,743
- Are you on medication?
- No.

256
00:21:29,285 --> 00:21:30,285
No.

257
00:21:34,207 --> 00:21:36,208
Tell me more about your...

258
00:21:36,918 --> 00:21:38,919
...dental studies.

259
00:21:41,422 --> 00:21:43,924
I was interested mainly...

260
00:21:44,175 --> 00:21:48,220
...in tumors of the gum
and the soft tissue of the mouth.

261
00:21:48,512 --> 00:21:49,762
Yeah?

262
00:21:50,722 --> 00:21:54,267
Tumors of the gum, huh? Wow.

263
00:21:54,601 --> 00:21:56,435
Dad, we're eating!

264
00:22:00,649 --> 00:22:02,650
Hold it, Ma. Anthony?

265
00:22:02,943 --> 00:22:05,570
- What does a gentleman do?
- In his own house?

266
00:22:05,862 --> 00:22:08,656
A girl's invited
Anthony to his first formal.

267
00:22:09,073 --> 00:22:10,949
Well, then?

268
00:22:19,584 --> 00:22:20,709
Okay?

269
00:22:21,002 --> 00:22:23,461
Thank you, young man.

270
00:22:27,008 --> 00:22:28,341
Okay.

271
00:22:29,093 --> 00:22:30,677
Tony!

272
00:22:33,888 --> 00:22:36,974
I told you your
mother was coming for dinner.

273
00:22:38,518 --> 00:22:42,187
- Hi, Mom.
- Well, look who's decided to join us.

274
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,690
And with that breath!

275
00:22:47,027 --> 00:22:49,612
You know, I really don't need
that right now, Ma.

276
00:22:49,821 --> 00:22:51,488
Aren't we being sensitive!

277
00:22:52,032 --> 00:22:55,326
Meadow, can you take some chicken
and pass it, please?

278
00:22:57,036 --> 00:23:00,330
- Where's Uncle Jun?
- He said he wasn't feeling well.

279
00:23:00,497 --> 00:23:04,751
Did you know the average
chicken's feet never touch the ground?

280
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,044
That's dicked up.

281
00:23:06,253 --> 00:23:08,171
If I was that young lady...

282
00:23:08,339 --> 00:23:10,632
...and you came and took me
to that dance...

283
00:23:10,883 --> 00:23:12,717
...and used that kind of talk...

284
00:23:12,968 --> 00:23:14,552
...I'd slap your face!

285
00:23:14,844 --> 00:23:16,762
That's right, Ma. Thank you.

286
00:23:16,971 --> 00:23:19,139
Well, the whole world's gone crazy.

287
00:23:19,349 --> 00:23:23,977
Some woman in Pennsylvania shot her
children and set her house on fire.

288
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,312
Here we go.

289
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,899
How come my son's in a bathrobe?
Is he sick?

290
00:23:29,192 --> 00:23:31,109
- He's fine.
- Dad, you're depressed.

291
00:23:31,402 --> 00:23:32,569
Depressed?

292
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:37,491
My father came to this country with
seventeen cents in his pocket...

293
00:23:37,741 --> 00:23:39,867
- ...and he never made a peep.
- Ma?

294
00:23:40,077 --> 00:23:42,203
What's he got to be depressed about?

295
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:45,081
Nobody threw him into
the glue factory...

296
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,167
...and sold his house out from
underneath him.

297
00:23:48,418 --> 00:23:50,211
We agreed to sell your home.

298
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,421
I'm going back upstairs.

299
00:23:52,714 --> 00:23:54,548
I was making a joke!

300
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:59,303
I suppose it would be better if I
never opened my mouth.

301
00:23:59,804 --> 00:24:01,846
How can it be a joke
if you're crying?

302
00:24:02,098 --> 00:24:04,140
This is really the last time.

303
00:24:04,433 --> 00:24:07,644
I am never coming back to this house.

304
00:24:20,865 --> 00:24:23,701
What a day! With this wind, huh?

305
00:24:24,327 --> 00:24:25,911
What you looking at?

306
00:24:26,162 --> 00:24:27,663
Nothing.

307
00:24:37,966 --> 00:24:39,341
Who's she?

308
00:24:41,176 --> 00:24:44,053
Dental student, from Italy.

309
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,472
You know her?

310
00:24:48,308 --> 00:24:49,976
We had lunch.

311
00:24:50,978 --> 00:24:52,687
Lunch?

312
00:24:54,565 --> 00:24:57,483
You fucking piece of shit.

313
00:24:58,402 --> 00:25:01,237
Going to dinner with you is
a distant memory for me...

314
00:25:01,488 --> 00:25:04,115
...but you have time to
take her to lunch?

315
00:25:05,324 --> 00:25:10,412
You're sinking this whole family into
your misery with your complaining...

316
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:14,708
...while I spoon-feed you
and bathe you!

317
00:25:15,168 --> 00:25:18,503
A half-inch of another woman's
thigh gets you out of bed?

318
00:25:18,713 --> 00:25:20,839
What am I, a fucking idiot?

319
00:25:21,674 --> 00:25:25,552
If I had an ounce of self-respect,
I would cut your dick off!

320
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:35,311
I was there last night for dinner.

321
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,188
I couldn't go.

322
00:25:37,647 --> 00:25:39,190
Those poor freaking kids.

323
00:25:39,357 --> 00:25:43,652
They barely have a father now. You
should see him at the dinner table.

324
00:25:43,862 --> 00:25:47,198
- I don't want to know.
- In his bathrobe at 7 p.m.

325
00:25:47,364 --> 00:25:49,991
Some bargain.
That's all anyone should pay.

326
00:25:50,201 --> 00:25:54,204
My cousin, Cakey, after his lobotomy,
looked exactly like my son.

327
00:25:54,371 --> 00:25:56,873
- Livia.
- Empty. A shell.

328
00:25:57,041 --> 00:26:01,002
Better Cakey die than live like that.
That's what his mother used to say.

329
00:26:01,253 --> 00:26:05,048
Don't talk about it anymore.
Don't talk about Tony. It's done.

330
00:26:26,361 --> 00:26:31,490
Mr. Tony, Miss Carmela said to tell
you she went to buy a suit for A.J.

331
00:26:33,534 --> 00:26:34,700
Go away.

332
00:26:34,952 --> 00:26:39,247
Okay, mister. Miss Carmela told me to
remind you of your appointment.

333
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:14,030
How you doing, Tony?
Pick Six today?

334
00:27:14,281 --> 00:27:17,783
No, just an orange juice
and a racing form today.

335
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,875
- This wind, huh?
- Yeah.

336
00:27:27,252 --> 00:27:29,253
Here you go.

337
00:27:31,882 --> 00:27:34,133
- Thanks. Take care.
- Okay.

338
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:11,251
Dead now, motherfucker!

339
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,007
Oh, shit!

340
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,701
Daddy! Where is he?
Please let him be all right!

341
00:28:46,911 --> 00:28:48,954
- They didn't say anything?
- They didn't.

342
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:53,166
Look who's here.

343
00:28:53,459 --> 00:28:56,503
Is he all right? Jesus Christ, Tony!

344
00:28:56,712 --> 00:28:59,631
Your ear's all bloody!
What'd they do to your ear?

345
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:02,716
I'm putting in stitches
to create a nice closure.

346
00:29:02,884 --> 00:29:04,385
We were so scared.

347
00:29:04,594 --> 00:29:06,261
They almost killed you
for a car!

348
00:29:06,471 --> 00:29:09,473
Guess nobody told them about
the gas mileage it gets.

349
00:29:09,724 --> 00:29:11,642
It's not funny, Dad.

350
00:29:12,477 --> 00:29:16,021
What's the matter? Forget how
to talk because I got banged up?

351
00:29:16,272 --> 00:29:18,899
- No.
- He's just frightened, that's all.

352
00:29:19,234 --> 00:29:21,652
Doctor needs to
finish up here, ma'am.

353
00:29:22,069 --> 00:29:24,779
All right. Let's give
the doctor some room.

354
00:29:26,281 --> 00:29:27,281
See you later.

355
00:29:30,494 --> 00:29:32,495
- Poor Dad.
- He'll be all right.

356
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:36,874
Christ!

357
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:41,796
You can't wait until they
finish sewing my ear back on?

358
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:46,092
One inch to the left and you're
in a drawer instead of talking to me.

359
00:29:46,342 --> 00:29:47,801
Who's talking to you?

360
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,012
What's he doing here?

361
00:29:50,263 --> 00:29:52,014
Agent Harris is just leaving.

362
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:54,558
We're offering your husband
full immunity...

363
00:29:54,809 --> 00:29:56,768
...in return for his testimony.

364
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:00,689
Relocate you and your family,
you'll be completely safe.

365
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,065
Don't talk to my wife.

366
00:30:02,275 --> 00:30:03,859
He wouldn't have to go to jail?

367
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,737
Carmela, ask this prick if
I'm even indicted.

368
00:30:06,945 --> 00:30:09,905
This assassination problem is
not going to go away.

369
00:30:10,115 --> 00:30:12,616
I told you to stop talking to my wife!

370
00:30:12,868 --> 00:30:14,535
Carmela, will you wait outside?

371
00:30:14,786 --> 00:30:15,786
Kiss my ass, Tony!

372
00:30:16,038 --> 00:30:19,749
We're your only option, Tony.
It's not safe for you anymore.

373
00:30:20,042 --> 00:30:23,044
- This conversation's over.
- What do you know?

374
00:30:23,295 --> 00:30:25,129
He knows nothing.
It was a carjacking!

375
00:30:25,338 --> 00:30:28,132
Now get out of here!
You're upsetting my wife!

376
00:30:28,299 --> 00:30:30,175
In case you change your mind.

377
00:30:37,141 --> 00:30:39,726
- You know he's right.
- Nothing will happen.

378
00:30:39,977 --> 00:30:43,146
Wake up, Tony! It already did!

379
00:30:45,733 --> 00:30:47,067
I took an oath, Carmela.

380
00:30:47,318 --> 00:30:48,985
Are you a kid in a tree house?

381
00:30:49,194 --> 00:30:51,320
Did you tell anybody about me
seeing Melfi?

382
00:30:51,613 --> 00:30:54,990
That's why they tried to kill you,
because you see a psychiatrist?

383
00:30:55,992 --> 00:30:57,743
It was a carjacking!

384
00:30:57,994 --> 00:30:59,703
Have the decency not to lie to me.

385
00:30:59,954 --> 00:31:03,082
What do you want to do, Carmela?
Move to Utah?

386
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:05,209
Be Mr. and Mrs. Mike Smith?

387
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:09,505
We could sell Indian relics.
Maybe start a rattlesnake ranch.

388
00:31:09,755 --> 00:31:13,841
This is our chance to get out, Tony.
We could start a whole new life.

389
00:31:14,051 --> 00:31:17,512
Have some Mormons over to dinner.
Eat some tomatoes with no taste.

390
00:31:17,721 --> 00:31:20,014
I want those kids to have a father.

391
00:31:20,265 --> 00:31:22,058
They got one. This one.

392
00:31:22,351 --> 00:31:26,020
Me. Tony Soprano.
And all that comes with it.

393
00:31:26,271 --> 00:31:27,522
Oh, you prick!

394
00:31:31,526 --> 00:31:32,943
Good.

395
00:31:37,698 --> 00:31:39,658
I can't go to that dance now either.

396
00:31:39,867 --> 00:31:41,535
God, self-involved much?

397
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:49,709
- It's Uncle Silvio and Uncle Paulie.
- Hey, squirt!

398
00:31:49,877 --> 00:31:53,171
- They shot my dad.
- He's all right, though, isn't he?

399
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:57,550
Take more than a Jamaican bobsled team
with cap guns to stop him.

400
00:31:57,884 --> 00:31:59,385
- Where is he?
- With Mom.

401
00:31:59,553 --> 00:32:00,845
All right.

402
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,646
They look kind of weird.

403
00:32:15,109 --> 00:32:17,735
I don't believe it was a carjacking.

404
00:32:24,326 --> 00:32:26,578
Today in Montclair, Anthony Soprano...

405
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:30,665
...who allegedly is a captain
in the northern New Jersey Mafia...

406
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:33,960
...was wounded in what he claims
was an attempted carjack.

407
00:32:34,253 --> 00:32:38,756
But sources in the FBI say it was
a gangland execution gone awry.

408
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:42,259
Soprano escaped with minor wounds and
was taken to an undisclosed hospital.

409
00:32:42,552 --> 00:32:47,347
One of his assailants,
William "Petite" Clayborn...

410
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,391
...was killed in the attack.

411
00:32:49,684 --> 00:32:52,144
Continuing now with...

412
00:32:52,854 --> 00:32:54,646
Is this true?

413
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:56,773
Do you think they made it up?

414
00:32:56,983 --> 00:32:59,860
But how could this happen?

415
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,904
I don't know. I don't frigging know.

416
00:33:03,113 --> 00:33:06,949
I feel like I'm floating in space.
He'll look for who did this.

417
00:33:07,284 --> 00:33:09,076
Anthony? Of course he is!

418
00:33:09,286 --> 00:33:13,915
- You understand what's going on?
- My son got shot and he got away!

419
00:33:14,124 --> 00:33:17,835
What do we do now?
What the fuck do we do now, Livia?

420
00:33:18,045 --> 00:33:19,629
- We go see him.
- Tony?

421
00:33:19,837 --> 00:33:21,630
Of course!

422
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:24,716
He's my only son.

423
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,845
Thanks, sweetheart.

424
00:33:29,138 --> 00:33:31,973
- We could use some peppers out here.
- I'll get them.

425
00:33:32,141 --> 00:33:33,850
Don't you have homework to do?

426
00:33:34,143 --> 00:33:35,977
I can't help too?

427
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,480
Some fucking shit, huh?

428
00:33:39,065 --> 00:33:42,025
Tony! Jesus fucking Christ!

429
00:33:43,526 --> 00:33:45,361
Who do we blame for the hat?

430
00:33:45,528 --> 00:33:47,321
I was on Denny Najarian's boat.

431
00:33:47,489 --> 00:33:50,783
Two shooters, and his piece
was under the seat.

432
00:33:51,034 --> 00:33:54,328
- You believe it?
- Two girls from the 'hood, that's all.

433
00:33:54,579 --> 00:33:58,582
- Do we know who they are?
- The live one took off in a Taurus.

434
00:33:59,668 --> 00:34:01,460
- Taurus?
- Yeah.

435
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:05,506
Moolies in a new Taurus.
Doesn't exactly fit the profile.

436
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:10,260
Motherfuck! These guys I had
a beef with at the newsstand.

437
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:13,012
- You were there?
- The day before yesterday.

438
00:34:13,264 --> 00:34:15,723
The newsstand? The one in Montclair?

439
00:34:16,392 --> 00:34:18,518
Yeah, I was in the neighborhood.

440
00:34:18,852 --> 00:34:20,186
What were you doing there?

441
00:34:20,396 --> 00:34:22,480
Taking my mother to the doctor.

442
00:34:25,275 --> 00:34:27,484
Hey, put it right there, baby.

443
00:34:28,069 --> 00:34:29,319
Thank you.

444
00:34:30,363 --> 00:34:34,533
This husband of yours, Carmela.
How much we love him.

445
00:34:35,034 --> 00:34:37,035
- He's the best.
- Come on.

446
00:34:37,203 --> 00:34:38,870
He's like a father to me.

447
00:34:39,872 --> 00:34:42,291
Just make sure nothing happens to him.

448
00:34:46,295 --> 00:34:47,712
I'll get it.

449
00:34:49,548 --> 00:34:50,840
Come on.

450
00:34:52,426 --> 00:34:53,968
All due respect, Tone...

451
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:56,429
...it had to be your uncle, right?

452
00:34:57,222 --> 00:34:59,348
Well, why fucking now?

453
00:34:59,725 --> 00:35:01,392
Maybe he found out.

454
00:35:01,852 --> 00:35:03,060
Found out what?

455
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:08,274
That he's Joe Jerk-off, not the boss.
That you run things behind his back.

456
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:09,524
Anthony!

457
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:11,901
Uncle Jun!

458
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:14,446
Don't get up. I heard your knee
was fucked up.

459
00:35:15,323 --> 00:35:17,032
Don't worry, I'm all right.

460
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:19,409
- Your ear's disfigured.
- It's all right.

461
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,244
Hi.

462
00:35:22,455 --> 00:35:26,583
Mikey and my crew are cracking
heads to find out who did this.

463
00:35:26,876 --> 00:35:30,545
When we're done with them they're
gonna wish they were never born.

464
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,589
Look who it is. Father Intintola!

465
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,342
I came as a friend.

466
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,344
- How are you, Tony?
- All right.

467
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:43,557
If you'd like to speak privately
we could kneel in prayer or...

468
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:45,100
Not right now.

469
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:48,854
Why don't you grab a sandwich
and we'll talk later.

470
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,940
- You're sleeping over, right?
- Can I get you anything?

471
00:35:52,149 --> 00:35:53,858
- Another sambuca?
- I'll get it.

472
00:35:54,109 --> 00:35:57,362
I'll take a curaçao, if you got it.
I'll buy him one too.

473
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,947
No, that's all right.
No alcohol for me.

474
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:01,908
Can he hear through that ear?

475
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:06,454
Ma, sit down. Here you go.
Have something to eat.

476
00:36:11,293 --> 00:36:12,293
Want some?

477
00:36:13,002 --> 00:36:14,419
Fuck, I thought it was him.

478
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,089
But there he is, glasses and all.

479
00:36:19,884 --> 00:36:22,302
Don't eat capocollo, Grandma.
It's all fat.

480
00:36:22,595 --> 00:36:24,513
Capocollo? Over here!

481
00:36:26,933 --> 00:36:28,517
Right there.

482
00:36:29,268 --> 00:36:30,268
Who is that?

483
00:36:30,436 --> 00:36:31,645
Who?

484
00:36:31,896 --> 00:36:34,272
- That girl.
- Who, Meadow?

485
00:36:34,481 --> 00:36:38,442
- Is that Concetta?
- It's your granddaughter. Meadow?

486
00:36:38,652 --> 00:36:41,946
All right, don't get impatient.
I'm your mother!

487
00:36:42,197 --> 00:36:46,158
Did you hear? Dad fought off
two black guys. One got shot.

488
00:36:46,326 --> 00:36:48,702
Why aren't you dressed for the dance?

489
00:36:48,995 --> 00:36:50,704
- I can't go.
- Why not?

490
00:36:50,997 --> 00:36:52,164
Don't you need me here?

491
00:36:52,457 --> 00:36:55,042
And disappoint the future
Miss New Jersey?

492
00:36:55,292 --> 00:36:57,293
Mom was gonna drive.
She can't now.

493
00:36:57,503 --> 00:36:59,045
You're gonna go.

494
00:37:51,638 --> 00:37:53,431
I gotta know something.

495
00:37:54,558 --> 00:37:56,559
And I want the truth.

496
00:38:00,146 --> 00:38:02,981
Did you ever tell anybody
about you and me?

497
00:38:04,775 --> 00:38:07,402
I may have mentioned
to my family...

498
00:38:07,612 --> 00:38:10,947
...that I had a patient who was
in trouble with something...

499
00:38:11,157 --> 00:38:13,408
...we were hearing about in the news.

500
00:38:15,077 --> 00:38:18,079
I never mentioned a name
or any other specifics...

501
00:38:18,372 --> 00:38:21,416
...that could identify you
as that person.

502
00:38:34,513 --> 00:38:36,013
My son's.

503
00:38:40,268 --> 00:38:42,102
Does your family know?

504
00:38:45,064 --> 00:38:48,733
My mother's made a few comments.
But I don't see how she knows.

505
00:38:48,943 --> 00:38:50,401
And even if she did...

506
00:38:55,241 --> 00:38:57,951
Don't even go there about
the old lady.

507
00:39:00,246 --> 00:39:04,165
You should've seen her at my house.
She was losing her mind.

508
00:39:07,043 --> 00:39:09,545
How are you doing with all of this?

509
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,217
I feel pretty good.

510
00:39:15,468 --> 00:39:16,885
- Really?
- Yeah.

511
00:39:17,095 --> 00:39:18,679
Well, that's good.

512
00:39:18,888 --> 00:39:21,223
Talk about a jolt to the system.

513
00:39:21,474 --> 00:39:22,683
Try getting shot at.

514
00:39:22,976 --> 00:39:25,394
It'll give you a nice kick start.

515
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,360
You know, when I was depressed...

516
00:39:35,612 --> 00:39:37,697
...I said I didn't want to live.

517
00:39:41,201 --> 00:39:43,119
Well, I tell you something.

518
00:39:44,705 --> 00:39:46,455
I didn't want to die.

519
00:39:47,082 --> 00:39:50,793
Every fucking particle of my being
was fighting to live.

520
00:39:57,133 --> 00:39:59,009
I had lunch with that girl next door.

521
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,468
You did?

522
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,304
Isabella.

523
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,891
She was telling me about...

524
00:40:07,685 --> 00:40:10,937
...Avellino, where my people are from.

525
00:40:11,271 --> 00:40:13,063
It sounded nice.

526
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,358
Anyway, she was talking...

527
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:18,694
...and then all of a sudden...

528
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:27,077
...we went to another place, like...

529
00:40:27,287 --> 00:40:29,288
...in my mind's eye.

530
00:40:29,539 --> 00:40:34,084
I don't know, we went back in time
to, like, 1907 or something.

531
00:40:36,086 --> 00:40:38,880
And we were in this room, me and her.

532
00:40:41,258 --> 00:40:45,720
And she was holding a baby on her
breast. She was nursing it.

533
00:40:45,929 --> 00:40:49,307
She was whispering to it, like,
"It's okay, little baby.

534
00:40:49,558 --> 00:40:52,060
Don't cry. It's gonna be okay.

535
00:40:52,311 --> 00:40:53,895
I love you."

536
00:40:56,773 --> 00:40:58,565
Did the baby have a name?

537
00:40:58,983 --> 00:41:00,901
She was calling it Antonio.

538
00:41:03,404 --> 00:41:05,697
Anthony, your fantasy...

539
00:41:05,907 --> 00:41:08,408
...that's you, that little baby.

540
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:11,536
And Isabella, that she was
nursing you.

541
00:41:21,254 --> 00:41:22,880
Fuck me.

542
00:42:02,585 --> 00:42:04,461
You think this is a stretch?

543
00:42:19,935 --> 00:42:22,437
Can we get some of that whiskey?

544
00:42:28,944 --> 00:42:30,069
Livia.

545
00:42:30,279 --> 00:42:33,156
You don't knock?
I could've been in the nude!

546
00:42:33,407 --> 00:42:34,741
What the hell is going on?

547
00:42:35,033 --> 00:42:38,077
- See if my slipper is over there.
- Fuck your slipper!

548
00:42:38,328 --> 00:42:40,621
I don't like that talk!

549
00:42:40,872 --> 00:42:42,706
What was that bullshit yesterday?

550
00:42:42,915 --> 00:42:45,751
You don't even recognize
your granddaughter?

551
00:42:47,545 --> 00:42:52,466
I've been forgetting things lately.

552
00:42:52,675 --> 00:42:56,845
You'll find that it'll happen
to you soon too.

553
00:42:57,221 --> 00:43:01,099
Terrific timing, after the
move on your son is in the toilet!

554
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:03,810
I don't know
what you're talking about!

555
00:43:16,031 --> 00:43:18,199
Hey, Cuse!

556
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:19,825
Cuse!

557
00:43:21,995 --> 00:43:23,204
How was Bermuda?

558
00:43:23,455 --> 00:43:26,290
Jeanie wrecked up a motorbike.
Hurt her ankle bad.

559
00:43:26,499 --> 00:43:28,500
- Oh, yeah? I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

560
00:43:28,793 --> 00:43:31,336
So where's your dental student?

561
00:43:32,588 --> 00:43:33,671
My what?

562
00:43:33,881 --> 00:43:36,299
Isabella. Haven't seen her
in a couple days.

563
00:43:37,384 --> 00:43:41,012
Your houseguest, Isabella.
Dark hair, beautiful.

564
00:43:43,474 --> 00:43:45,016
You don't know what I'm saying?

565
00:43:45,226 --> 00:43:48,228
Tony, I got no idea
what you're saying.

566
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:52,356
You didn't have an Italian girl?
She's here studying?

567
00:43:52,607 --> 00:43:56,151
We had Skippy Palumbo from down
the street take care of the dog.

568
00:43:58,613 --> 00:44:00,239
Never mind.

569
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,783
Forget it. Joke.

570
00:44:03,743 --> 00:44:06,245
- I'll talk to you later.
- All right.

571
00:44:14,378 --> 00:44:16,963
You sure about this? You're not
pulling my leg?

572
00:44:17,172 --> 00:44:20,424
What am I, an idiot?
Of course I'm sure!

573
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,969
- You never...?
- No!

574
00:44:23,262 --> 00:44:28,391
I think I've said enough about it.
I never threatened to cut your dick off.

575
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:42,863
- Hello?
- Yeah, it's your patient.

576
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:45,782
The one who's been involved
in the news lately?

577
00:44:46,075 --> 00:44:47,868
- I gotta talk to you.
- What's wrong?

578
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:51,121
- There was no Isabella.
- What?

579
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:55,416
There was no Isabella.
I just talked to Cusamano...

580
00:44:55,625 --> 00:44:57,960
...he just got back from Bermuda.

581
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:02,464
I asked, "Where's the dental student?"
He looked at me like I was pazzo.

582
00:45:02,757 --> 00:45:06,051
But you said that your wife saw her,
that you argued about it.

583
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:08,178
Yeah, I asked her about that.

584
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:10,347
- And?
- You thought she was pissed then?

585
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:14,226
You should see her now that I said
it was a fantasy.

586
00:45:15,311 --> 00:45:16,686
Discontinue the lithium.

587
00:45:17,062 --> 00:45:18,187
I already flushed it.

588
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,692
Even if it was the medicine,
this fantasy of yours has meaning.

589
00:45:22,985 --> 00:45:27,697
You know, the issue of mother
and child. The Madonna.

590
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:29,824
You didn't see this broad.

591
00:45:30,034 --> 00:45:33,494
Did you ever flirt or come on
sexually with Isabella?

592
00:45:33,703 --> 00:45:35,162
- No.
- Why not?

593
00:45:35,455 --> 00:45:38,498
You said she was very
beautiful and voluptuous.

594
00:45:38,708 --> 00:45:39,791
Another question:

595
00:45:40,001 --> 00:45:41,084
Why now?

596
00:45:41,878 --> 00:45:43,253
- What?
- Why the need...

597
00:45:43,588 --> 00:45:46,173
...for the fantasy of
a loving woman now?

598
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:50,844
- I don't know.
- Come in.

599
00:45:51,095 --> 00:45:52,512
We can talk face to face.

600
00:45:52,722 --> 00:45:54,222
I can't right now.

601
00:45:54,682 --> 00:45:58,393
Your mother is always
talking about infanticide.

602
00:45:58,602 --> 00:46:00,603
It's a sad situation in the world.

603
00:46:00,854 --> 00:46:04,523
- Do you still feel okay?
- I feel pretty good, actually.

604
00:46:05,776 --> 00:46:08,945
When I find out who shot at me,
I'll feel even better.


1
00:01:41,237 --> 00:01:43,113
JUNIOR:
We know what we're gonna do.

2
00:01:43,406 --> 00:01:45,657
Till the government indicts, anyway.

3
00:01:46,284 --> 00:01:50,078
Jimmy! This answers your concerns?

4
00:01:50,288 --> 00:01:52,706
I think a lot of good ground
was covered.

5
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:57,085
JUNIOR:
Okay, I guess that's it.

6

the nature of your emergency. Hello?

Oh, God!

MELFI: I take no pleasure in the fact
that I was right about your mother.

354
00:25:32,352 --> 00:25:34,854
Have any dreams since you heard
the FBI tapes?

355
00:25:35,022 --> 00:25:36,522
No.

356
00:25:41,528 --> 00:25:43,529
Some sex dreams.

357
00:25:46,158 --> 00:25:48,618
- Involving?
- My neighbor.

358
00:25:49,244 --> 00:25:50,995
Jean Cusamano.

359
00:25:51,997 --> 00:25:53,247
Go on.

360
00:25:53,498 --> 00:25:55,458
We're doing it doggie style...

361
00:25:56,752 --> 00:25:58,002
You know Jean.

362
00:25:58,462 --> 00:26:00,254
That's okay, go on.

363
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,342
I'm doing her doggie style...

364
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:09,138
...and I finish, you know,
and her big ass is...

365
00:26:10,015 --> 00:26:12,016
We don't got time for this shit!

366
00:26:12,225 --> 00:26:14,894
It's interesting that you would
say a big ass...

367
00:26:15,103 --> 00:26:16,729
...because Jean is quite slender.

368
00:26:16,897 --> 00:26:19,315
We got bigger things to talk about
than Jean's ass.

369
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:23,527
Feelings of worthlessness sparked by
your mother's plot to have you killed?

370
00:26:23,737 --> 00:26:26,030
One of the reasons they
tried to have me clipped...

371
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:28,366
...is because I'm seeing a shrink.

372
00:26:28,617 --> 00:26:30,242
- You.
- Oh.

373
00:26:31,244 --> 00:26:32,662
Oh.

374
00:26:33,122 --> 00:26:35,457
You know that our conversation
is privileged...

375
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,251
...and I couldn't testify
against anybody.

376
00:26:38,586 --> 00:26:41,880
Well, maybe they know that.
And maybe they don't.

377
00:26:42,256 --> 00:26:44,383
Either way, they're using it
as an excuse.

378
00:26:44,634 --> 00:26:48,136
You never mentioned
any of your associates by name.

379
00:26:48,429 --> 00:26:51,807
Except for that one fellow, Booty?

380

381
00:26:53,726 --> 00:26:57,187
Pussy, Booty,
I don't know his last name!

00:26:57,647 --> 00:26:59,981
And anything concerning
your Uncle Junior...

Shut the fuck up a minute!

384
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:07,114
- You're in danger.
- Get out of here! That's not fair!

385
00:27:07,323 --> 00:27:09,783
Oogots, fair.
They don't give a shit about fair.

386
00:27:13,371 --> 00:27:15,247
What am I supposed to do?

387
00:27:15,456 --> 00:27:18,625
Leave town. Today. Right now.

388
00:27:18,835 --> 00:27:22,295
I'm gonna get some guys here
until you get on a plane!

I can't just do that, lam it!

390
00:27:24,882 --> 00:27:26,675
I have a life, I have patients!

391
00:27:26,926 --> 00:27:28,385
Tell them August came early.

392
00:27:28,636 --> 00:27:32,431
It doesn't work that way.
I have patients who are suicidal!

393
00:27:32,682 --> 00:27:34,850
They won't feel any better
if you get clipped!

394

395
00:27:38,688 --> 00:27:41,398
Look, I know, I'm sorry, okay?

396
00:27:41,607 --> 00:27:45,318
I'm gonna work on this problem
and I'll take care of it...

397
00:27:45,528 --> 00:27:47,237
...and you'll be able to come back.

398

Don't worry about those distractions,
you keep your eye on the ball.

- I know what you're thinking.
- You have no idea.

402
00:27:59,835 --> 00:28:02,837
The cops aren't gonna help you
because you can't give them anything!

403
00:28:05,841 --> 00:28:08,551
Don't be stupid!
Even in the short term.

404
00:28:09,011 --> 00:28:11,053
Get the fuck out of town.

405
00:28:15,684 --> 00:28:18,811
You've been a good doctor to me.
Thank you.

How the fuck could you?

410
00:28:41,376 --> 00:28:42,668
You took their money?

411
00:28:44,588 --> 00:28:45,880
Good, then do it.

412
00:28:46,089 --> 00:28:47,882
I don't give a fuck anymore.

413
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:50,676
That restaurant was like my child.

414
00:28:51,053 --> 00:28:53,012
So they got in your ear.

415
00:28:53,889 --> 00:28:57,225
Three generations of Buccos
sweated over that same stove.

the memory of Vesuvio.

Don't say she's lying, Tone.
Because why would she?

00:29:10,657 --> 00:29:11,907
What'd she tell you?

00:29:12,116 --> 00:29:13,659
Don't make it worse.

00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:19,248
Do me the respect of not treating me
like a fucking idiot piece of shit!

422
00:29:21,209 --> 00:29:26,338
When you blew up the restaurant, you
made me part of a criminal conspiracy!

423
00:29:26,673 --> 00:29:28,340
Did you ever think about that?

424
00:29:28,842 --> 00:29:32,970
I don't know what she told you,
my mother, of all people.

425
00:29:34,347 --> 00:29:37,558
Arson investigators gave that fire
a clean bill of health.

426
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,351
Why would I blow up
your restaurant?

You fucking bent psycho!

You hear your uncle's gonna hurt my
business by staging a hit...

429
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:50,404
...and that's your solution?

430
00:29:50,697 --> 00:29:53,740
To burn it down
for the insurance money!

431
00:29:56,035 --> 00:29:59,246
What kind of stupid,
sick, twisted logic?

432

Look me in the eye.

The reason you haven't
told Charmaine...

507

...is because you know she'll insist
you go to the police immediately.

No, that's mine. One True Thing,

I was over at Video One anyway...

692
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:30,014
...I thought you'd want to take
your mind off these stressors.

693

You want to stay for dinner?

694
00:49:36,355 --> 00:49:38,106
Something wrong, Carm?

695
00:49:38,316 --> 00:49:40,567
Tell me so I know
how many steaks to defrost.

Well, if...

698
00:49:45,656 --> 00:49:48,325
As I was saying,
my real concern for Tony...

699
00:49:48,701 --> 00:49:53,121
Father, he doesn't give a flying fuck.
You know it and I know it.

700
00:49:53,331 --> 00:49:55,373
At least for the foreseeable future.

701
00:49:55,583 --> 00:49:58,168
- Even a bigger reason...
- He's a sinner.

and use his entertainment center.

- Really?

I'm not a Renée Zellweger fan!

You did? I don't remember that.

You want to watch One True Thing,
fine. At least admit it.

Mea culpa!

"who, me?" shit with Tony.

710
00:50:30,368 --> 00:50:33,745
"Has Tony thought about changing?"
Father, please.

711
00:50:33,996 --> 00:50:38,333
You do think I'm a schnorrer,
don't you? A parasite.

712
00:50:38,584 --> 00:50:41,711
You denied it,
but clearly that's what you think.

713

No, you know what I think, Father?

I think you like the...
I don't know what to call it...

715
00:50:48,303 --> 00:50:52,431
...the whiff of sexuality
that never goes anyplace.

716
00:50:53,392 --> 00:50:56,435
I have feelings for you, Carmela,
I admitted it.

00:50:56,728 --> 00:51:00,940
It's my job to deal with them
so I can carry on my pastoral duties.

fit into your feelings for me?

Oh, so that's it.

I appreciate everything that you've
done for me, Father Phil.

the wonderful chats.

I am very fond of you.

724
00:51:22,754 --> 00:51:24,380
More than fond.

725
00:51:25,716 --> 00:51:28,301
But I think you need
to look at yourself.

Call this an intervention.

727
00:51:33,515 --> 00:51:38,603
I think you have this m.o. where you
manipulate spiritually thirsty women.

728
00:51:39,313 --> 00:51:42,398
And I think a lot of it is tied up
with food somehow...

729
00:51:42,608 --> 00:51:45,526
